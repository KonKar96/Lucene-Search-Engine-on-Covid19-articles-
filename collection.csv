China's response to COVID-19: a chance for collaboration/-/April 8 marks a year since China's lifting of the 76-day lockdown in Wuhan—the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the reopening of Wuhan, efforts to control the pandemic in China have thus far successfully prevented resurgence and importation of new cases, while re-establishing the country's social and economic activities. Although China has since had sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 in several areas, including Beijing and Qingdao, they were all contained. How has China managed to control COVID-19? And is the global scientific community in a position to benefit from China's experiences?According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China's strategy was built on active case finding and case management with identification and quarantine of close contacts, as well as risk-based lifting of restrictions. Chinese authorities aim to test each suspected case and all close contacts of those infected. After three COVID-19 cases were identified in October, 2020, in Qingdao, a pooled testing approach coordinated by the government with the cooperation of residents enabled 10·9 million people—almost the entire population of the city—to be tested within 5 days. Although few COVID-19 cases have been reported, people are generally adhering to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as avoiding large gatherings. After the government urged people to abandon travel plans, and with local governments imposing strict quarantine measures, there was a 70% drop in the number of passenger trips across the country in the 2 weeks leading up to the Chinese Lunar New Year this year, compared with the same period in 2019. China's public health measures, as well as the public's compliance, largely owing to high trust in the government, have contributed to the effective response. Elements of China's approach, such as those that involve monitoring citizens’ whereabouts, might not be countenanced in many western countries. However, China's domestic successes in controlling COVID-19 stand in contrast with outcomes elsewhere, and other countries should learn what public health lessons they can.Internationally though, there is a high level of scepticism towards China. Anti-China sentiment has intensified. With respect to science, transparency over data is a continuing point of contention. After the WHO–China joint report investigating SARS-CoV-2 origins, published on March 30, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, commented on the international team's work in Wuhan: “In my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data. I expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing.”Lack of transparency is also an issue for Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. China had administered over 100 million doses of domestically developed vaccines by March 27, 2021, and it aims to vaccinate around half a billion people (40% of the Chinese population) by the end of July, 2021. The first Chinese vaccine, manufactured by Sinopharm, was approved by domestic regulators on Dec 30, 2020. Other vaccines have been approved in subsequent months. However, as we go to press, no phase 3 trial results for any China-developed vaccine have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The Chinese regulator promised to continue monitoring the vaccines, but very little post-marketing surveillance data are available. Global access to more vaccines could make an important impact on the trajectory of the pandemic, and WHO hopes to issue recommendations on Chinese inactivated vaccines by the end of April, 2021. Having comprehensive data publicly available is imperative for understanding the efficacy and safety of these vaccines, which is vital for building trust in them.When it comes to science and health, collaboration is much more productive than antagonism. In a Viewpoint, Liming Li and colleagues argue that strong US–China collaboration on matters of medicine is crucial for efforts against COVID-19 and future pandemics. They also highlight other common health interests of China and the USA, including non-communicable diseases, global health, mental health, ageing, urbanisation, and climate change. They call for the restoration of partnerships on health and medicine between government agencies, as well as the academic and scientific communities.Such collaborations are as important now as ever. Learning from each other has advanced health and science in China and the rest of the world. Global health challenges require global responses and cooperation. These bonds are built on transparency, trust, and mutual goals. This is not a time for blame or competition between countries but a time to work together on the common threats to all people.For more on the approval of the Sinopharm vaccine see http://english.nmpa.gov.cn/2020-12/31/c_579192.htmFor more on the approval of the Sinopharm vaccine see http://english.nmpa.gov.cn/2020-12/31/c_579192.htm
“In an ocean of ashes, islands of order”: WHO's SARS-CoV-2 origin report/-/The highly anticipated WHO report on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 was released on March 30. 34 international and Chinese multidisciplinary experts reviewed hundreds of thousands of items of epidemiological, clinical, and genomic data, some dating back to 2015, and the corresponding plausibility of four origin hypotheses: direct zoonotic spillover, zoonotic transmission via an intermediate host, importation via food in the cold chain, and accidental laboratory release. Although, the report is preliminary overall, it concludes that the most likely route of SARS-CoV-2 emergence was from a bat lineage via an unidentified intermediate host with more frequent human contact, in which the progenitor virus might have been circulating undetected for decades. Nevertheless, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, “all hypotheses remain on the table”.The report, or more accurately the work and organisation that produced it, has already been criticised for not going far enough, the methodology not being transparent enough, and being too late. Speculations have been made that the Chinese Government's close supervision of the process, from visa arrangements through data access to the physical whereabouts of the international team at all times, have precluded meaningful conclusions. Indeed, one wonders how much can truly be achieved by 17 individuals who spend 2 weeks in quarantine and 2 weeks at exclusively pre-arranged, chaperoned meetings? 14 WHO member states have already issued a statement calling for an independent, transparent investigation with full access to raw data, which were often not available. Critics also point towards the report's supposed legitimising of the cold-chain hypothesis advocated by Chinese state media that leaves open the possibility that the virus originated elsewhere. Still, because of ongoing tensions between political spheres of influence, an investigation led by a USA–EU consortium is unlikely to be as independent as it might like to appear. Across the Lancet journals, we remember the urgency and gravity with which Chinese scientists prepared the first papers describing COVID-19 to alert the world of the impending threat. Zoonotic transmission of pathogens has accompanied humanity throughout its existence and can happen anywhere, whereas the report shows that the cold-chain hypothesis is rather unlikely, on the basis of available data so far. WHO have been criticised for not holding China accountable but, as others have pointed out, its member states have given it practically no mandate to do so.WHO needs much more time to find enough concrete evidence in the vast remnants of clues of an event that happened (at least) 16 months ago to identify the origin of SARS-CoV-2. The team has made many recommendations for further study. Granular mortality and burden data from respiratory diseases beyond Hubei province need to be provided for time-series analyses to better clarify whether there was widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation before the initial outbreak in Wuhan. This should be paralleled by thorough contact-tracing and review of full clinical reports linked to public gatherings to identify missing links in transmission. More detailed reports of past weekly purchases of antipyretics and cold medicines should also be reviewed. Curiously, traditional Chinese remedies, which are increasingly prevalent in China and could have been used as first-line treatments for cold-like symptoms, were not considered by the WHO team. Indeed, the raw and full data for the first 174 COVID-19 cases need to be examined, along with any early suspected but discounted cases. It would be necessary to re-assess any such stored patient samples using standardised tests with proven performance that only became available later in the pandemic. The same applies to samples from early studies suggesting circulation of the virus in other countries in mid-2019. Blood banks are also an important potential source of serological data that could be explored. Finally, a much more thorough sweep of domestic and wild animal genomes (curated in a purpose-built database) across China and east Asian countries, where horseshoe bat, pangolin, and other species susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 live, is needed to pinpoint the intermediate host, if any.Whatever the truth, all sides would be better off if they engaged in less finger-pointing and a lot more cooperation towards a One Health approach to future investigations. Only then can order out of chaos be made.
Pandemic fans the flames of smoking and health inequity/-/During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence suggests that fewer people are stopping smoking and more ex-smokers are relapsing. This finding is especially concerning because smokers are at a higher risk of severe disease and death if they become infected with SARS-CoV-2.The North American Quitline Consortium reported that they received 27% fewer calls to their operator portal, which directs people to their local quit lines, in 2020 versus 2019. Cigarette sales in the USA also increased during 2020, according to the US Treasury Department, for the first time in decades, and data suggest that vaping rates in adults decreased. In the UK, 86 (25%) of 329 current smokers reported in a national survey that they were smoking more than usual. This increase in prevalence of smoking, reduction in quitting rate, and potential move back to smoking from vaping, might be due in part to the increased stress and anxiety felt by many people during the pandemic. One survey from the CDC found that 40·9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioural health condition, including symptoms of anxiety or depression, and 13·3% started or increased their substance use to cope with the stress and emotions they felt as a result of the pandemic.Efforts to quit smoking have also been challenged by reduced access to helplines, cessation clinics, face-to-face support, and appointments with general practitioners during the pandemic. Evidence suggests that comprehensive cessation interventions are essential to reduce tobacco use. Without the appropriate support to help them quit, people are likely to be less motivated to stop smoking. And the vicious cycle of anxiety, social isolation, lack of support, and boredom is likely to fuel unsuccessful attempts to quit. With people spending more time at home, it is easier to relapse, with more opportunities to smoke, lack of a routine, and without observation and judgment from others.Individuals who smoke are more likely to be from a low-income background, be a person of colour, or have mental health issues, all of which are also factors that increase the health risks posed by COVID-19. More needs to be done to overcome current obstacles to accessing smoking cessation resources during the pandemic, especially in these at-risk communities. Providing support that is suitable and accessible for all, to encourage and enable those who would like to stop smoking, is vital.However, this pattern of increased smoking during the pandemic is not one that is necessarily seen globally. Some countries—eg, India—banned the sale of tobacco during lockdown in April, 2020, while others aimed to reduce tobacco use through measures such as banning the use of waterpipes in public places. Although these actions were enforced on a temporary basis, they did highlight the potential for strengthening policies to reduce the burden of tobacco use worldwide. People who smoke tobacco were prioritised on the vaccine list above people in professions that might be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (eg, teachers) in one US state (NJ, USA), which led to much controversy.Similar to many other health issues, smoking prevention and cessation, and treatment for smoking-related illness have moved down the list of priorities in health care over the past year. Lung cancer prognosis is already bleak, but one study found that 38% fewer new lung cancer cases were diagnosed during the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19, with more symptomatic and severe cases of non-small-cell lung cancer being diagnosed during the pandemic period. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at a late disease stage, so treatment needs to be swift; any delays caused by the pandemic further increase the risk of unfavourable outcomes in these vulnerable patients.Many innovative smoking cessation measures have been implemented over the past 5 years—for example, smartphone apps that send regular text messages. The pandemic has presented an opportunity to build on technology-based cessation methods as part of a move towards telemedicine, with support provided remotely. Many of these interventions can be tailored to the needs of the individual, enabling as wide a reach as possible.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused greatest harm to the most vulnerable groups in our society. With many overlapping risk factors and health issues relating to smoking and COVID-19, prioritising smoking cessation and support for this high-risk patient group is essential to increase the likelihood of successfully quitting tobacco, and as part of wider measures to move towards a tobacco-free world.
Racism in the USA: ensuring Asian American health equity/-/Racist anti-Asian incidents and rhetoric in the USA have been on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, by some accounts increasing as much as 150%. The horrific mass shooting on March 15, 2021, in which six of eight people killed in three spas in Atlanta, Georgia, were Asian women, has prompted urgent conversations about prejudice against Asian Americans. Organisations including the American Medical Association were swift to underscore that racism, in addition to gun violence, is a public health crisis. The American Psychiatric Association warned that the shooting could compound the trauma and fear already experienced in Asian American communities. 2020 was a year of reckoning around race in the USA and national introspection about the maltreatment of people of colour; 2021 is a year to consider how racism and discrimination, alongside other social determinants, shape the broader context of health. April is National Minority Health Month and an opportunity to draw attention to Asian American health and wellbeing.The term “Asian American” carries a measure of controversy in trying to define an extraordinary mix of people, cultures, and languages. It is not a matter of semantics, but an issue of representation. Asian Americans include people with ancestry from east Asia, south Asia, southeast Asia, and in some instances Pacific Islanders or Native Hawaiians. Asian Americans constitute about 6·8% of the population of the USA and unlike any other ethnic or racial minority group, about two-thirds are foreign born and have entered the USA in the past 10 years. The largest Asian American subgroups are Chinese (4·2 million), followed by Filipino (3·6 million), Indian (3·3 million, and the fastest growing), Vietnamese (1·9 million), and Korean (1·8 million).As a predominantly immigrant minority group, Asian Americans can face specific barriers to accessing health care such as residency requirements for Medicaid eligibility (health coverage for low-income Americans) or being more likely to be employed in jobs that do not cover private insurance. Language proficiency can also limit an individual's ability to navigate a challenging health-care system. In relation to educational attainment and income level, immigration status can vastly bifurcate health outcomes.Providing a comprehensive picture of the health of Asian Americans is complex, challenging, and incomplete. Only in the past decade has research on health outcomes and disparities among Asian Americans gained momentum. Scarce data can routinely obscure or minimise health disparities for ethnic and racial minorities. In a Correspondence, Nancy Krieger and colleagues point to the stunning and continued paucity of ethnic and racial data being collected for COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. In general, Asian Americans have historically been seemingly healthier than other groups and compared with the US general population. For example, overall cancer incidence is lower in Asian Americans than in non-Hispanic White people. However, Asian Americans are at increased risk for liver and stomach cancers and are the only group for whom cancer remains the leading cause of mortality. Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in Asian Americans as a group (9%) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (7·2%), but it is substantially higher in subgroups of Asian Americans such as Filipino men (15·8%). Understanding such differences could inform the use of prevention or earlier screening strategies.Tailored public health strategies to improve health equity will be an important means to counter the so-called model minority myth—ie, the expectation of excelling socially and academically. Asian Americans are often portrayed as self-sufficient and resilient, and are the least likely of all ethnic groups to seek mental health treatment. Cultural pressures and feelings of shame or stigma, especially around mental health disorders, treatment for cancer, and previous trauma can be deterrents to seeking help. However, culturally competent care could be improved through some of the solidarity and impact of Asian Americans as health-care providers. About 17% of all US physicians identify as Asian American. Although over-represented in number, increasing visibility and obtaining more leadership positions within health care is an important goal.Health equity in the US demands recognition of the contributions that immigrants make to society, understanding and provision of appropriate responses to the different needs of groups and individuals, and the dismantling of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans.For more on racism-related stress from the model minority myth see https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/stress-racismFor more on racism-related stress from the model minority myth see https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/stress-racism
COVID-19 and cancer: 1 year on/-/It has been a year since the UK entered its first COVID-19 lockdown on March 23, 2020, with unprecedented consequences. Although the pandemic is far from over, what have its impacts been on cancer care in the UK and globally, and what does the future hold?COVID-19 has had devastating effects on patients with cancer, with huge numbers of missed diagnoses and delayed treatments due to health systems under pressure and patient reluctance to seek medical care. Despite repeated reassurances from officials that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) remained open for urgent care, a study estimated that 45% of those with potential cancer symptoms did not contact their doctor during the UK's first wave of the pandemic (March–August, 2020), citing reasons including fear of contracting COVID-19 and avoiding placing extra strain on the NHS. Consequently, suspected cancer referrals fell by 350 000 compared with the same period in 2019. Combined with interruptions in cancer screening programmes and delays in scans and diagnostics, a spike in late cancer presentations and diagnoses is anticipated, making some previously curable tumours more difficult to treat and, unfortunately, further excess deaths unavoidable. This problem prevails internationally, even in countries praised for their management of COVID-19; a study estimated that in the state of Victoria, Australia, around 2500 cancer diagnoses were missed during the first 6 months of the pandemic.The pandemic has also caused major delays in cancer treatments. Around 40 000 fewer people than normal started cancer treatment in the UK last year, and US hospitals have been deluged by COVID-19 cases, rendering patients with cancer unable to obtain timely care. WHO has reported that one in three European countries had partially or competely interrupted cancer care services early in the pandemic. The UK's NHS currently has more than 4·6 million people on waiting lists for surgery and 300 000 people have been on hold for more than 12 months—a wait time that is 100-times higher than before the pandemic. A large proportion of these delays are for patients with cancer, and the Royal College of Surgeons is particularly concerned, stating that it could take several years to clear the backlog. Moreover, UK cancer surgeons are increasingly fearful of a wave of compensation claims from patients unable to receive their treatment during the pandemic and whose cancers have subsequently progressed and become harder to treat. Moreover, lockdown-associated lifestyle habits—eg, unhealthy diets and reduced physical activity—could cause a further increase in the prevalence of obesity-related cancers in the years ahead.Despite this gloomy narrative, perhaps some hope can be gleaned from the crisis. Remarkable scientific advances have facilitated huge progress in tackling COVID-19, with several vaccines now being distributed and others in the pipeline. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)'s rapid approval of the BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, enabling their swift rollout, could help to accelerate approvals of other new drugs, including cancer treatments. For example, belzutifan, a promising treatment for Von Hippel-Lindau disease that causes renal cell carcinoma, has received a so-called innovation passport from the MHRA, putting it on track to receive an approval decision within 150 days of the final submission of trial data. Furthermore, the sophisticated science underlying some COVID-19 vaccines could be used to create new interventions for other diseases, including cancer. The developers of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine have founded a new biotechnology company that will use the technology underpinning their vaccine to develop new cancer therapies, and a trial of a new treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer will begin soon. Lastly, repurposing of existing drugs to treat patients with COVID-19 could indirectly benefit patients with cancer. If these drugs can be administered at home to prevent severe illness and hospitalisation, pressures on health systems will be reduced, allowing other health services, including cancer care, to get back on track.To mitigate the devastating effects of the pandemic on cancer care, the UK and other countries need to capitalise on the scientific advances of the past 12 months to recoup some of the huge losses and setbacks. Effective cooperation and collaboration within and between countries, unlike that regrettably displayed by some governments regarding vaccine distribution, is essential and must not stop once the pandemic response is scaled back. Only then can the lessons from this unprecedented time be used to overcome the long-term indirect consequences of the pandemic on cancer control.
Long COVID: understanding the neurological effects/-/The concept of so-called long COVID has gained prominence in recent months, with some patients reporting persistent neurological manifestations, from milder symptoms such as headaches, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and fatigue to more severe conditions including sleep disorders, pain, cognitive impairment, and (in very rare cases) Guillain-Barré syndrome. WHO updated their living guidance for the clinical management of COVID-19 in January, 2021, which now incorporates a new practice statement on caring for patients with persistent, new, or changing symptoms after suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The guidance notes that clinical characterisation of long COVID is inadequate and, therefore, further research on long-term sequelae is warranted.Multiple initiatives to gather clinical neurological data about COVID-19, with the aims to aid management and to understand the long-term clinical manifestations of the disease, were launched last year. In April, 2020, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) set up the EANcore NeuroCOVID-19 task force and began collating resources to help neurologists prepare for and manage this medical crisis. Almost 1 year on, the task force has accomplished some goals, including producing a consensus statement on the management of patients with neurological diseases and COVID-19. The EANcore NeuroCOVID-19 task force has also created the ENERGY registry to evaluate the prevalence of neurological manifestations in patients with confirmed COVID-19, the findings of which are expected to be published later in 2021. EAN has also established collaborations with several international organisations, including a formal collaboration with the Neurocritical Care Society in the USA.Additionally in the USA, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is supporting several projects, including an initiative to track neurological symptoms, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19, to gain insights into how the disease affects the nervous system and to estimate the prevalence of these potentially rare complications. One of the NINDS-supported initiatives is the NeuroCOVID Project, which was launched on Jan 26, 2021, by researchers at NYU Langone Health. The project aims to build and maintain an international resource of deidentified clinical data and biospecimens. Recognising the scant understanding of the recovery process after SARS-CoV-2 infection, NINDS is also participating in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) Initiative. Research opportunities were announced by the PASC Initiative in February, 2021, and will provide grants for clinical recovery cohort studies, autopsy cohort studies, and studies based on real-world data, with the aim to identify risk factors for and biomarkers of adverse long-term outcomes and to understand pathophysiological mechanisms that could help in development of prevention strategies and novel treatments.The EAN and NIH initiatives can be added to multiple additional projects that have been started worldwide. In May, 2020, the Environmental Neurology Specialty Group of the World Federation of Neurology (WFN) committed to curate research from national and international registries, making these data freely available on the WFN website. However, with so many registries available, the risk of duplication of data and variation in case definitions are potential complications. With much still unknown about the long-term effects of COVID-19, and many projects ongoing or being initiated, organisations need to work together. Approaches need to be standardised, and case definitions should be used consistently across studies. With the aim to refine guidelines for the management of patients with COVID-19 and characterise its long-term neurological manifestations, large-scale and multidisciplinary collaborations will be essential.As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, a notable achievement has been approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. People with neurodegenerative diseases are at particular risk for a poorer outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection, since pre-existing comorbidity and older age are risk factors. Vaccination strategies are prioritising older adults and people with comorbidities. However, despite expectations about vaccination heralding the return to normality, availability of vaccines is limited and many people are likely to remain unprotected for a long time to come. In the meantime, collaboration to improve our knowledge of COVID-19, including its long-term neurological manifestations, must continue to be a high priority.
COVID-19 in France: challenges and opportunities/-/A year into the pandemic, France has been hit hard by COVID-19. Health-care workers and people in the community are exhausted. There have been 4 million reported cases and 90 000 deaths due to COVID-19, as of March 15. This grim milestone is an opportunity to review what has happened, but it is also an opportunity for France to put equity at the centre of its recovery.In this issue of The Lancet Public Health, a series of papers present different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In their nationwide epidemiological study, Jean Gaudart and colleagues analysed COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, mortality, and factors potentially associated with the first wave of infections in France. For Gaudart and colleagues, the country “could absorb the shock, thanks to a strong hospital system and a national lockdown”. In another study, Thomas Roederer and colleagues focused their analysis on one of the most vulnerable groups in society and assessed seroprevalence and risk factors in homeless people relocated to emergency shelters. They noted high exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and high asymptomatic seroprevalence. Living in crowded conditions was the strongest factor associated with exposure, underscoring the importance of providing safe, uncrowded accommodation, alongside adequate testing and public health information to this vulnerable population. The study by Michaël Schwarzinger and colleagues investigated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its determinants, such as vaccine characteristics or place of vaccination. Although most determinants were hypothetical at the time the study was done (July, 2020), such analyses are particularly important in a country where vaccine confidence has been persistently low. They estimated that 30% of adults were likely to refuse vaccination outright. Latest data from the CoviPrev survey suggest that this proportion has decreased from 32% in December, 2020, to 21% in February, 2021.Research is crucial in informing public health and government responses, but another important aspect is the role of health democracy—too often neglected—in the decision making process. The inclusion of individuals such as major city mayors or frontline health-care workers, for example, could be key when gaining public trust is difficult but essential. In their Correspondence, Eva Brocard and colleagues from the Conférence Nationale de Santé share their perspective on the importance of greater civil society involvement.While this issue of the journal touches upon several important aspects of the COVID-19 crisis in France, it is far from exhaustive, and several other aspects deserve attention. For example, the latest CoviPrev survey data show that about a third of the French population report symptoms of anxiety or depression; “This is the epidemic behind the pandemic” warns Geneviève Chêne, chief executive of Santé Publique France. The state of mental health and wellbeing in 18–24-year-olds and the most vulnerable is particularly alarming.A thorough review of the pandemic and its associated responses will be crucial to identify strengths, weaknesses, and possible missed opportunities. The conclusions of the Independent Mission, led by Didier Pittet (University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland), to assess the French response to the COVID-19 epidemic are eagerly awaited. The Mission has been tasked with assessing the preparation of the country for a pandemic; crisis management (chronology of decisions, governance, and communication); and comparing the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic with other countries. Their interim report, published in October, 2020, noted that the French hospital system showed a great capacity to adapt, but it also highlighted structural weaknesses regarding governance and “defects of anticipation, preparation and management.” Such an assessment is key to drawing out lessons learned for future public health crises.The COVID-19 crisis could be an opportunity for countries to build back fairer, as Sir Michael Marmot discussed in the latest Lancet Voice, with equity, health, and wellbeing at the heart of all policy. France is no exception. Socioeconomic inequalities have made certain groups especially vulnerable to COVID-19. However, for France, little is known about the extent to which people from minority ethnic groups have been affected. Maybe it is time for public health stakeholders to question a probably outdated restriction on ethnic data collection— a crucial step to map systemic inequalities and inform policies. An ambitious government policy is now needed to mitigate the impacts of the crisis and wholeheartedly tackle inequalities and the sociodeterminants of health.
Digital tools for mental health in a crisis/-/In January, 2021, WHO member states stressed the importance of integrating mental health into response and preparedness plans for public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. To meet these aims, the WHO Executive Board urged member states to develop and strengthen services for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) by promoting equitable access to remote health services during the pandemic and beyond, and to study the impact of the pandemic on mental health. What has been the role of digital tools for mental health during the pandemic thus far, and how might it help health services identify challenges that are still to come?The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a substantial amount of distress experienced by people both with and without a prior mental health diagnosis. However, the necessary restrictions of lockdown have limited physical access to mental health services. A study by Mansfield and colleagues published in The Lancet Digital Health found a substantial decrease in the number of primary care contacts for mental health conditions following the introduction of the first UK lockdown in March, 2020. This study highlights the need for alternative means of delivering mental health services.Many services have risen to the challenge. Indeed, WHO found that, of 130 countries surveyed, 91 (70%) have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy for MHPSS, and evidence suggests these remote consultations have been effective at improving and treating mental health conditions, including anxiety and substance abuse. However, the percentage of adoption varies considerably between countries, being less than 50% in the 15 low-income countries surveyed, because of limited resources. Additionally, patient uptake of remote consultations can differ across sociodemographic factors, being lower in non-White ethnicities and in people aged 65 years and older. This digital divide is also apparent in the use of mobile apps. There are approximately 20 000 consumer-available mobile apps for mental health, and while some are supported by evidence of efficacy, not all are designed to be inclusive. The move to digital services is a promising start, but there is more to do. Now is the time to address the digital divide, ensure equitable access across a diverse population, and identify groups for whom digital services are not preferable or feasible, and who should be prioritised for different models of service delivery.Digital tools should not just be used reactively in mental health. AI and big data can be leveraged to understand the impact and scale of mental health issues emerging in response to the pandemic. By applying machine learning models to SMS text messages and social media data, studies have detected an increase in language symptomatic of mental health concerns associated with COVID-19. Such digital phenotyping could be used to identify cases and monitor them for changes. But innovation needn't only apply to the cutting edge of data science; established projects such as the UK Household Longitudinal Study are using online surveys and telephone calls to gather data on the temporal impact of the pandemic on the welfare of individuals. However, the research community must take the time to address fundamental issues such as the representativeness of population samples and the clinical validity of the measures used to define and identify mental health conditions—and, of course, the ethical issues surrounding data collection and privacy. As Becky Inkster, Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, UK, puts it, “It's easy to envisage a future whereby technology, AI, and big data can support mental health and wellbeing, but with 21st century ‘mind reading’ comes new challenges and responsibilities. We are at a critical point where we can get it right if we act in a coordinated, ethical, and human-centred way.”Digital tools can provide an effective way to deliver mental health support at scale—invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic—and have the potential to help forecast future problems. But they can only do so if researchers and practitioners answer the urgent call for individuals and organisations to dedicate themselves to meaningful and sustainable equity and diversity in digital health, and best practise in data science. In the words of William Beveridge, whose work formed the foundation of the UK's welfare state: “A revolutionary moment in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.” A message from an analogue past that the digital future would do well to heed.
Can technology increase COVID-19 vaccination rates?/-/Vaccine ready is the theme of the National Minority Health Month in April, 2021. This initiative aims to educate the public on health problems facing minority populations in the USA. The vaccine theme has been chosen because, paradoxically, although minority populations have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, they are also reported to be the least likely to be vaccinated. Barriers against vaccination among minority populations have been widely reported, including low confidence in the vaccine, poor access, and distrust of the health system. The WHO Digital Health Flagship initiative has stated that digital technology could play a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic by improving communications between people and health services, empowering individuals and patients, and strengthening critical public health functions including disease surveillance. Can technology also help build trust and promote vaccination within communities that are most at risk?Systemic biases in health care, typically caused by under representation in clinical studies, have caused mistrust among minority populations. Studies indicate that this mistrust is deep-seated, even among minority health-care workers who also show lower vaccine uptake in the UK and the USA. Representation of minority ethnic groups in vaccine efficacy trials has been disproportionately low. The lack of data in these populations is a barrier to uptake if communities perceive that these vaccines are not established to be safe and effective for them.The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy amongst minority groups is concern about adverse effects. Rapid and transparent reporting on potential adverse effects could go some way to improve communication and potentially reduce hesitance among minority populations. One such technology, V-safe, employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a smartphone tool to track side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines directly from patients. A similar tool has been developed in the UK, the Yellow Card app, to enable close monitoring and real-time reporting of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. V-safe and the Yellow Card app have empowered individuals to provide real-time information of side-effects and help establish a trusted, public-led vaccine safety monitoring programme.Success of these tools in tracking adverse events is essential as the UK regulating body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), report that they are expecting between 50 000 and 100 000 adverse event reports for every 100 million doses delivered to patients over a 6–12 month period. However, simply increasing the volume of data will not solve the problem of tracking and communicating genuine adverse events to the public. Many reported side-effects are not causal and inaccurate reporting has been shown to cause significant damage, especially when influenced by the media, anti-vaccine activity, and political lobbying. An example of such harm has already been seen in the premature abandonment of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine across countries in Europe despite an absence of robust evidence supporting the decision.Here is where artificial intelligence (AI) could help. To manage the wealth of data from adverse events tracking, the MHRA have awarded £1·5 million to develop AI that can identify genuine COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects. While experts have applauded the MHRA's forward thinking approach, development of AI based on limited self-reported public data and electronic health records that are subject to historic and systemic bias must be validated on data from minority and other at risk populations to maintain trust within these communities.To combat bias in datasets and algorithms, transparent auditing of clinical AI tools is essential to accurately communicate results to the public for greater vaccine uptake. As the UK and the USA pass the milestones of 20 million and 100 million people (respectively) vaccinated against COVID-19, associated data must be made transparent and accessible. Datasets such as the England and Wales COVID-19 vaccination datasets, which are available upon request to researchers, are critical to communicate real-world effectiveness of the vaccine to the public.President Biden has recently pledged over $500 million in additional funds to address vaccine uptake in the USA. This funding must be spent on establishing transparent COVID-19 vaccine data to aid informed public decisions. Technology can help monitor progress of vaccine programmes, but it will not be enough to establish trust among the public, especially among those most at risk.
Communication combats hesitancy/-/From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, rheumatologists have been inundated with questions and concerns from their patients about whether their rheumatic disease, or the drugs they use to treat them, might increase their risk of COVID-19. With COVID-19 vaccination programmes now underway in many countries, patients' concerns have shifted toward questions about the vaccines and whether they are safe for them to receive. The short answer is yes.In February, 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) released draft guidance on the use of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. The top line guidance is that all patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases should receive a COVID-19 vaccination, ideally in the setting of well controlled disease; there are no established contraindications among these patients, with the exception of existing allergies to vaccine components.The COVID-19 vaccination programmes in the USA and UK comprise three approved vaccines: the BNT162b2 (BioNTech-Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mRNA-based vaccines, and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) adenoviral-based vaccine. Patients with autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids were excluded from these vaccine trials, likely contributing to concerns and uncertainty among these patients. A small number of patients with rheumatic disease (less than 0·3% of the trial population) were included in the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine trial; however, no specific safety or efficacy data have been reported for this sub-group.The rapid development, approval, and release of COVID-19 vaccines has led to uncertainties among the general population, which might reduce willingness to get vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy—the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines—was problematic even before COVID-19, driven by political and social forces along with an increasing culture of misinformation, and resulting in a resurgence of infections (like measles) in many countries. Indeed, WHO has considered vaccine hesitancy as one of the ten greatest threats to global health since 2019. France is a notable example, with 29% of the working-age population recently reporting that they would refuse a COVID-19 vaccine. In another survey, hesitancy was highest in those at risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.Hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines hovers around 40-50% among patients with rheumatic diseases, according to the results of two surveys reported in this issue of The Lancet Rheumatology. Among 1727 patients from the Netherlands, 61% reported being willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine; only around half (54%) of 1266 patients included in an international survey were willing to get vaccinated, compared with 74% of health-care professionals surveyed. Willingness to get vaccinated was not influenced by disease type or medication use. Other estimates have been more optimistic; another survey reported that 87% of adults with rheumatic diseases would have the vaccine.Among reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were concerns about adverse events, absence of long-term research, and the possibility of disease flares. The ACR guidance acknowledges a theoretical risk of disease flare after COVID-19 vaccination; yet so far, the data are insufficient to assess that risk. Indeed, ACR, EULAR and the British Society for Rheumatology concur that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, irrespective of diagnosis or treatment regime. Ongoing global surveillance of vaccine-related adverse events will be crucial to unpick the risk of disease flare.An ongoing question is whether treatment plans should be modified prior to vaccination in patients taking drugs that suppress the immune system. Again, there is as-yet little direct evidence to address this question, although extrapolation from other vaccines (eg, influenza) might suggest that modifications to treatment plans and specific timing of vaccination should be considered and discussed with patients on an individual basis.Crucially, most surveys indicate that the willingness of patients with autoimmune and rheumatic diseases to get vaccinated increases when recommended by a physician. While there are myriad challenges inherent to successful vaccination of the global population, it is clear that clinicians (and the scientific community) have a vital role to play in maximising vaccine uptake. Indeed, honest, clear, and consistent communication and guidance is perhaps more critical now than ever to ensure sufficient global vaccine provision and uptake to eventually gain the upper hand against COVID-19.
Vaccine certificates: does the end justify the means?/-/As COVID-19 vaccination programmes proceed in many countries, governments worldwide are considering issuing so-called vaccine certificates to facilitate the re-opening of their stumped economies by easing some restrictions for individuals who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. But are such certificates justified? Are they likely to be useful? And, most importantly, are they fair?The assumption underlying the use of COVID-19 vaccine certificates is that vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of becoming infected and spreading the virus. Under this assumption, vaccinated individuals could resume activities that entail social interactions and international travel without substantially contributing to onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within their community or abroad. On this basis, the USA and Israel have changed their behavioural recommendations for vaccinated individuals.Israel, which has already given at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine to over half of its adult population, deployed a vaccine certificate, the so-called green pass, in late February. Holders of a green pass can go to venues that remain inaccessible to unvaccinated individuals (eg, theatres, concert halls, and indoor restaurants and bars) and will be allowed unrestricted travel to Greece, following an agreement between the two countries. In the USA, according to new recommendations of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention published on March 8, vaccinated individuals are allowed to mingle indoors among each other without wearing masks or maintaining physical distance, and can also do so with a restricted number of unvaccinated people, provided they are at low risk of severe COVID-19.However, the effect of vaccination on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been reliably elucidated yet. Preliminary reports from Israel, the UK, and the USA suggest that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines could reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission either by lowering the viral load in post-vaccination infections or by preventing asymptomatic infections as well as disease. But until these data have been peer-reviewed and their validity confirmed, uncertainty will remain around the epidemiological utility of relying on vaccine certificates to re-open economies.On these grounds, WHO recommends against the introduction of COVID-19 vaccine certificates for international travel. Nonetheless, it has established a Smart Vaccination Certificate working group, primarily to define what security standards certificates should meet. Security should undoubtedly be the foundation of vaccine certificate development, to guarantee users are protected from data misuse, falsification, and breaches of personal and health data privacy. But there are other considerations to be made.Unknowns about the duration of vaccine-induced immunity and the risk of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with full vaccine-escape capabilities emerging raise questions about the validity period of vaccine certificates and the logistics of ensuring holders remain immune to circulating viral strains.From a societal standpoint, granting vaccine certificate bearers access to select activities, venues, or international travel would undoubtedly provide impetus to the reopening of some sectors of the economy, such as hospitality, non-essential retail, and tourism. But it also risks generating hierarchical societies in which vaccinated individuals have exclusive privileges that are denied to those who have not received the vaccine. In countries where vaccine rollout is advancing rapidly, this inequity might be resolved in few months, but elsewhere it could be protracted for longer periods. And at an international level, against the backdrop of the currently limited availability of COVID-19 vaccine doses and their inequitable global distribution, the deployment of vaccine certificates for travel will afford citizens of high-income countries greater freedom of movement than citizens of low-income and middle-income countries.Striking a balance between supporting national economies and containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the main challenge for governments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. It, together with principles of fairness and equity, will also need to be a key consideration in the assessment of whether to issue COVID-19 vaccine certificates. But crucially, governments must ensure they base their decision, which could have resounding societal implications, on reliable scientific evidence supporting the epidemiological utility of this tool.
COVID-19: building a stronger Europe/-/Europe is facing serious third waves of COVID-19 and vaccine roll-out has been fraught. But while much of the focus has been on western Europe, little attention has been paid to central and eastern Europe. This region is large, politically diverse, and historically complex, spanning EU member countries like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and the Baltic states, the non-EU western Balkans, and Ukraine further east. It is unclear how some of these countries managed to keep cases low during the first part of 2020. By mid-March 2021, six of the top ten countries globally with the highest death rates per 100 000 people were in central and eastern Europe (up to 230·34 in Czech Republic). This fact raises questions about the general state of health across the region. It also gives urgency to the issue of how Europe as a whole can best ensure its collective health security and prosperity. As COVID-19 brings immediate crises to Europe, health could be a unifying force to strengthen the ties between countries both within and outside the EU.A pandemic such as COVID-19 will exploit any weaknesses in a country's health or health systems. Populations in central and eastern European countries have aged over the past 30 years, but life expectancy still lags, by up to 6 years in Bulgaria (74·8 years vs the EU average of 81·0 years). Life expectancy in Ukraine, outside the EU, is just 71·6 years. Rapid economic growth in most of these countries has not necessarily resulted in high spending on health systems. Infrastructure has improved in many countries—eg, Estonia has invested heavily in digitalisation—but average spending on health, at 5% of gross domestic product, is still lower than most other European countries (the EU average is 9·8%). A lack of public health initiatives on issues such as tobacco, obesity, and alcohol have made these major behavioural drivers of ill health. These risk factors account for 40% of the disease burden in Romania, for example. Poor wages and poor working conditions have led to a health-care worker shortage; Poland had the lowest doctor to patient ratio in the EU at 2·3 doctors per 1000 inhabitants in 2017. Large communities, such as the Romani population and ethnic Turks, face marginalisation and discrimination, resulting in poor access to health care, including vaccination. How individual health systems will cope with the coming months is uncertain.There are reasons to be hopeful. With respect to COVID-19, Serbia and Hungary have vaccinated 10–15% of their populations. Romania has donated surplus vaccine to Moldova. The European Commission has mobilised over €1 billion to support health systems in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. WHO and the European Commission are working closely together to provide medical supplies. Martin McKee and Hans Kluge have written a Comment in The Lancet announcing a Pan European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development aiming to improve and anticipate the ability of the region to respond to health threats.Building resilient health systems through improving health security is about more than vertical programmes related to emerging infections. A European Health Union has been proposed by the European Commission that retains member states' national competencies but identifies health as an issue that transcends borders. Currently, it is unclear how far these proposals will go: strengthening the European Medicines Agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and pharmaceutical procurement chains are important steps. Health security across Europe will be built by reducing inequalities in life expectancy, facilitating broad public health measures, and strengthening individual health systems. But a European Health Union is a contentious issue for member states. Health holds huge political capital, not only as a way the state can communicate with and garner loyalty from citizens but also as an issue that politicians can campaign on, and many will feel uncomfortable about a bolder move in this direction. But national responsibility for health and regional and international solidarity on health are mutually beneficial and should not be treated as opposing forces.The coming months hold much uncertainty and danger, but the EU and the wider European region have an opportunity to steer the immense health issues facing countries away from politicisation and division and toward a health diplomacy that builds a stronger EU within a stronger Europe. Central and eastern Europe is a good place to start.
Access to COVID-19 vaccines: looking beyond COVAX/-/Global health leaders have been in a congratulatory mood. On March 1, they celebrated the first vaccinations against COVID-19 in Africa delivered through COVAX—the scheme led by GAVI, CEPI, and WHO to support research and development, raise funding, and negotiate the bulk purchase and equitable global distribution of vaccines for COVID-19. As of March 9, 12 million doses have been shipped to 29 countries, marking the beginning of the largest vaccine roll-out in history. This is an unprecedented achievement. Yet COVAX is wholly unequipped to resolve many of the most pressing threats to its mission. Global vaccination is central to ending the pandemic, yet it has been dealt with at far too low a political level. Too many obstacles are going unchallenged. A high-level individual or group with political acumen, technical competency, and the ability to advocate for justice is needed to galvanise the effort.There is a startling lack of solidarity between countries. As outlined in a Health Policy paper, the many bilateral deals struck between governments and vaccine manufacturers, independently of COVAX, threaten the supply of doses. Rich nations have given money to COVAX and paid lip service to the idea of vaccines for all while scrambling to buy up all the doses they can. Olivier Wouters and colleagues report that polities representing only 16% of the global population have secured 70% of the available doses for the five leading vaccines in 2021. As a result, dozens of countries have yet to administer a single dose, whereas others have already immunised large proportions of their populations. COVAX will continue to face competition for purchasing doses and risks being outbid; it can only bemoan such agreements. No one may be able to persuade countries to cease these deals entirely. But a well respected and dedicated former head of state with the ability to encourage and cajole prime ministers and presidents might have more success in encouraging countries to behave more equitably. It would be far better for countries that have made bilateral deals to donate a fixed proportion of their acquired doses to COVAX, for example, than simply promise to share their surpluses. An authoritative voice with moral credentials is needed to support global access to vaccines, to intervene when that goal is under threat, and to call out unfair practices.Clearer leadership and oversight are also needed to bring greater cohesion to the complex patchwork of national governments, technical organisations (including GAVI, CEPI, WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank), the private sector, and civil society that is aiming to ensure global access to vaccines. The list of well meaning but varied vaccination targets is growing. COVAX's current conservative aim is to immunise 20% of people in each country, which it estimates is enough to cover high-risk groups and health workers. Most high-income countries seem set on a policy of mass vaccination. The African Union has set a target of 60% coverage, whereas Nigeria, for example, is aiming for 40%. Some order needs to be brought to these disparate goals.A dedicated envoy or tsar could also help moderate disagreements between countries, which are hampering global COVID-19 vaccination. Last year, South Africa and India called on the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property protections on COVID-19 drugs and vaccines to boost manufacturing. Despite support from the WHO Director-General, the proposal has languished under opposition from the UK, the USA, Canada, Norway, and the EU. Meanwhile, on March 4, the Italian Government blocked the export of 250 000 doses of the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccine bound for Australia following disagreements between the manufacturer and the EU. These issues require political and diplomatic solutions. They cannot be solved by technical agencies.Who should take on this role? If a UN Special Envoy, they must be more than a symbolic appointee, flying around the world to shake hands with political leaders and getting little done. Their tasks must be actionable. The Elders, a group of varied political leaders formed by Nelson Mandela to use public and private diplomacy to advance justice and human rights, have successfully championed causes such as universal health coverage, and have the requisite experience.Whoever it is, they must above all be able to drive a worldwide movement. Although the roll-out of vaccines brings hope, case numbers are increasing again globally and there is a grave risk of complacency. Progress has been capricious and there are still many uncertainties about COVID-19, not least the impact of new variants. Global vaccination is essential to ending the pandemic but this fact has still not prompted the unity required to deliver it. Far more vision and ambition are needed. They must come from the highest political levels.
A glimmer of hope beyond the spring for Europe/-/When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe in early 2020, people were forced, for the first time, to comply with what were perceived as Orwellian, almost nightmarish, restrictions. Yet, Europeans adapted to the restrictions bravely, and the scenes of people singing together from their balconies or playing tennis on rooftops were uplifting and created a sense of unity and common purpose. 1 year later, feelings in the continent are quite different. The uncertainty about when normal life will finally resume, the continuous introduction and lifting of restrictions at short notice, and the mixed messages on what the future might hold from politicians and media have taken their toll on the resilience of many Europeans.By the beginning of March, more than 22 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in the EU/EEA, including more than half a million deaths. Since health within the EU is responsibility of member nations, the control measures put in place for COVID-19 have varied markedly within and between countries. While many countries, such as Italy and Spain, adopted national lockdowns initially and then moved to a differential regional approach, others like Sweden did not include such restrictive measures. Inevitably, the result of the varied approaches is that the EU saw 27 different social experiments in COVID-19 control. The fact that different levels of restrictions have led to similar epidemiological situations has added to the debate on what measures are necessary, leading to growing public pressure to relax control measures. For example, the Netherlands has just eased some lockdown measures in what Prime Minister Mark Rutte called a calculated risk to make the year-long crisis “bearable”.Politics is inevitably shaping the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the different EU countries. For example, in the Czech Republic, which is now facing a dramatic upsurge of COVID-19 cases, control measures were softened in September ahead of the national elections, overruling the recommendations of scientific advisers. There is concern that decisions on public health measures could become political tools in other countries with looming elections, such as Bulgaria.The crucial area where EU countries need to work hard to boost the morale of their citizens is COVID-19 vaccination, with only 6·5% of adults living in the EU having received the first vaccine dose so far, compared with more than 27% in the UK. The delays in vaccine availability and delivery within the EU are making the tantalising return to some sort of normality by the summer a chimaera. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines have been purchased at EU level, but manufacturers are not providing the number of vaccine doses agreed in contracts. Thus, while not being recommended by WHO, individual countries have started to negotiate independent deals with other vaccine manufacturers. Recently, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that the 27-member bloc expects to vaccinate 70% of adults by the end of the summer. However, in a recent interview, Rasmus Bech Hansen, CEO of the data analytics company Airfinity, highlighted that while Malta can expect to reach herd immunity by fully vaccinating 75% of its adult population by Aug 8, Bulgaria and Latvia could only achieve a similar level of protection in late October. France might have to wait until Sept 26 to achieve that level of coverage, unless the vaccination campaign is accelerated.Paradoxically, in some European countries there are stocks of unused COVID-19 vaccines. At the end of February, the German health ministry said that it had used just 15% of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses it had received as people across the country refused the vaccine. Similarly, France had issued just 16% of its Oxford-AstraZeneca doses as of Feb 25, Italy a fifth, and Spain a third. By contrast, uptake of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is around 80%. This situation is partly due to the fact that some countries, including Germany and France, had originally chosen to restrict the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s because of a lack of clinical trial data on its effectiveness among the elderly, although the EU's European Medicines Agency has approved the jab for all age groups. On top of that, vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing issue in countries such as France where recent polls suggested that just 57% of respondents intended to get vaccinated.The coming months will require further sacrifices for Europeans, but this time should also be an opportunity to strengthen communication on vaccines, organise vaccine delivery, and collaborate with each other. With a joint effort, the day when Europeans feel like singing again will come soon enough.For more on Rasmus Bech Hansen speaking about vaccine roll-out in the EU see https://www.airfinity.com/newsroomFor more on Rasmus Bech Hansen speaking about vaccine roll-out in the EU see https://www.airfinity.com/newsroom
Metabolic health: a priority for the post-pandemic era/-/Rallying behind the mantra Every Body Needs Every Body, this year's World Obesity Day (March 4) calls on the global community to come together and work towards the common goal of building happier, healthier, and longer lives for everybody. Raising awareness of obesity as a disease, increasing understanding of its multifactorial roots and the solutions needed to address them, changing society's perception of and response to obesity, creating healthier environments, and prioritising obesity as a health issue will be key. Only then, can we turn the tide on the obesity epidemic, improve the lives of those living with obesity, and spare future generations a similar burden. With 800 million people worldwide living with obesity, childhood obesity predicted to increase by 60% in the coming decade (reaching 250 million by 2030), and medical costs associated with obesity expected to exceed US$1 trillion by 2025, it is clear that current efforts to prevent and treat obesity are inadequate.As a major contributor to mortality, action on obesity (including its prevention and treatment) is of the utmost importance. Recently published data showed that excess adiposity now accounts for more deaths in England and Scotland than smoking among people aged 45 years and older. The percentage of all deaths attributable to smoking or former smoking fell from 23% in 2003 to 19% in 2017, while deaths due to adiposity (overweight and obesity) rose from 18% in 2003 to 23% in 2017, reflecting underlying changes in the prevalence of smoking and obesity. Additionally, obesity is now the leading cause of other metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A recent analysis of longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; 2000–17) and serial cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2001–16) reported that US adults with obesity were almost three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people without obesity, and that approximately 40% of new-onset diabetes in the period 2013–16 was directly attributable to obesity, with rates highest among non-Hispanic White women (53%) and lowest among non-Hispanic Black men (30%). The impact that reducing rates of obesity could have on preventing type 2 diabetes in the USA is clear to be seen.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the underlying poor metabolic health in our society, with metabolic diseases associated with COVID-19 severity and worse outcomes. A recently published comparative risk assessment of COVID-19 hospitalisations in the USA showed that the majority were due to one of four cardiometabolic conditions. Of the more than 900 000 hospitalisations that occurred up to Nov 18, 2020, 30% were attributable to obesity, 26% to hypertension, 21% to diabetes, and 12% to heart failure. Moreover, the researchers estimated that a 10% reduction in each of the four cardiometabolic conditions would have potentially prevented 11% of COVID-19 hospitalisations. Further insight into the impact of underlying metabolic comorbidities on COVID-19 outcomes can perhaps be inferred from provisional life expectancy estimates released by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in the USA. In the first 6 months of 2020, life expectancy fell by a full year—the most dramatic decline since during World War 2. Provisional life expectancy from birth is now at the lowest level since 2006 for the total population (77·8 years). Although the decline in life expectancy reflects not just the toll of the pandemic but also an increase in deaths from drug overdoses, heart attacks, and other causes, metabolic comorbidities are likely to also have played a role.With now in excess of 115 million infections and more than 2·5 million deaths from COVID-19 reported worldwide, many of which occurred in people with poor metabolic health, COVID-19 has sent the world a wake-up call about its inaction on metabolic diseases. In the post-COVID-19 era, metabolic health must be a priority, with obesity taking centre stage as the number one non-communicable public health concern of our time. As the obesity epidemic we know today is a relatively recent phenomenon, taking off in the USA only as far back as the 1990s, changing its trajectory is possible. We know many of the solutions to preventing and treating obesity but, more than words and promises, we now need true action. The days when obesity and metabolic diseases were just about other people are long gone; directly or indirectly, all of us are or will be affected in some way or another. The mantra Every Body Needs Every Body has never been truer.
Is the worst of the pandemic over for Europe?/-/Almost a year ago, on March 11, 2020, WHO declared the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic. At that time, 90% of cases were concentrated in only four countries, three being in Asia—China, South Korea, and Iran. Italy was the first European country to be crippled by the COVID-19 mayhem, which then swept through the entire continent and beyond in successive waves. European countries now rank high in the list of deaths and cases of COVID-19 per capita. In the first wave, western European countries recorded high excess mortality rates, whereas eastern Europe escaped unscathed due to early travel restrictions and lockdowns in the region. This trend shifted in the second wave, and eastern European countries have now recorded even higher excess mortality rates. As vaccination campaigns gain momentum across Europe, many people are starting to believe that the worst of the pandemic is now over. However, the emergence of new virus variants, some of which may be more contagious or deadly, is a sobering reminder that the course ahead is still challenging, and that a careful, well balanced, pragmatic implementation plan is needed to leave the worst of the pandemic behind for Europe.The plan should first aim to expedite mass vaccinations across the continent and to overcome present obstacles of vaccine production and accessibility. The EU bloc of countries currently has only three vaccines at its disposal—from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, as approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA). The rolling out of these vaccines has been slower than expected due to limited production capacity. While the West has been dismissive of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, Russia should be applauded for their efforts in making their vaccine available and affordable to countries across the globe. As of February 2021, 21 countries have granted Sputnik V emergency use authorisation, while over a billion doses of the vaccine were ordered for immediate distribution globally. Countries like Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Belarus, have fared well by the purchase of Sputnik V. Serbia rolled out Sputnik V and China's Sinopharm vaccines alongside the BioNTech/Pfizer jab and now ranks third in vaccination coverage in Europe after Israel and the UK. More vaccines from different providers need to be approved and rolled out to accelerate reaching immunity at the population level. While the bulk of global vaccine doses are manufactured outside of Europe, ramping up their production in the continent will accelerate local distribution. Support by the French pharma company Sanofi to use its German facility to produce BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines for distribution in Europe will partly help to overcome the bottleneck of vaccine production.In parallel, public health campaigns—commercials, posters, and advertisements—for vaccinations and continued practice of non-pharmaceutical interventions (mask wearing, social distancing, and hand washing) should be adopted by governments as a long-term action plan for COVID-19 mitigation. Such public health campaigns have proven to be a tried-and-tested method, with success in the containment and elimination of polio and the control of measles, mumps, and rubella. Enhanced cross-border and intra-border contact tracing has also been proven effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in many countries such as China, Australia, and New Zealand—a strategy that has not been fully exploited by European public health authorities.Looking further ahead, for all these measures to work effectively, a collective treaty on preparing for present and future pandemics at a regional level, similar to the Influenza Pandemic Preparedness framework comprising both EU and non-EU European countries, would be most impactful in the long term. As of February 2021, the European Commission has presented plans in this direction, with a proposal for a Health Union to bring together the member states to respond collectively to future cross-border health threats. The plan also includes a new EU agency called European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), especially responsible for biomedical preparedness. Although a step in the right direction, a plan that is more inclusive of non-EU member countries would have been more beneficial for the whole region.The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has put rich countries at a definitive advantage; at the same time, there is the question of ethical and moral responsibilities to support low-income countries with sufficient vaccine jabs. Almost half of the world's vaccine supply to date has been reserved for only 15% of its people. Three-quarters of all vaccinations so far have happened in ten countries that account for 60% of global gross domestic product, whereas 130 countries have yet to administer a single dose. A WHO–EU joint initiative to fund distribution of vaccines in eastern Europe and central Asian countries aims to support the regions in their vaccination efforts but, without vaccines to distribute, the initiative will fail to help the EU's Eastern neighbours. Even the COVAX initiative—co-led by Gavi, CEPI, and WHO, for fair and equitable distribution of vaccines—is barely scratching the surface. With this initiative, 1•3 billion donor-funded doses are being made available to 92 nations eligible for the Gavi COVAX Advanced Market Commitment, targeting only 20% of population coverage by the end of the year. Albeit benevolent and ambitious, this goal will still leave many vulnerable to infection and transmission.To truly leave the pandemic behind, the world needs the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich to have equal access to the vaccines, and Europe has a crucial role to play in this philanthropic mission. A reassuring pledge has been made by the world leaders at the virtual G7 meeting on Feb 19, to donate a part of their vaccine supplies to the developing nations. Only time can tell if these promises will be fulfilled.
COVID-19 hindering progress against female genital mutilation/-/Feb 6 marked the annual International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)—a violation of girls' and women's health and human rights. It is estimated that more than 200 million women and girls have been subjected to FGM; in addition, each year, an estimated 3 million girls are at risk. FGM is an extreme form of violence and discrimination against girls and women, reflecting deep-rooted gender inequality.FGM has no health benefits and is harmful. FGM can cause severe pain, bleeding, infection, urinary problems, mental distress, and gynaecological and childbirth complications. FGM poses immediate and long-term risks to women's physical, mental, and sexual health and wellbeing. FGM's burden is an economic one too. The WHO FGM cost calculator estimated the physical and mental health-care costs associated with FGM across 27 countries where the practice is highly prevalent. The total cost amounts to US$1·4 billion annually.Although 26 countries in the Middle East and Africa have banned FGM, in many countries the practice is still too common. FGM is rooted in local and cultural practices within families and communities. Good progress has been made over the past three decades with an overall decline in the prevalence of the practice, but progress has been uneven; in some countries such as Guinea, Mali, Sudan, and Somalia, prevalence of FGM has remained extremely high (above 90%, according to UNICEF data).Worryingly, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, it is deepening inequalities, and it could soon have catastrophic effects on women and girls, as previous experience in responding to humanitarian crises and outbreaks has shown. The COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate existing gender inequalities and increase the risk of gender-based violence. Schools closures, movement restriction, and confinement hamper access to prevention, protection, and care services, leaving girls vulnerable, especially in hard-to-reach areas.According to the anti-FGM organisation Orchid, from March, 2020, early in the COVID-19 crisis, reports began to emerge from their local grassroots partners that they were witnessing elevated rates of FGM. It is a worrying signal. According to their report Impact of COVID-19 on Female Genital Cutting, built from surveys with grassroots activists, COVID-19 lockdowns present opportunities to carry out FGM “undetected”, and the lack of integration of services within the COVID-19 response is leaving girls at risk with no recourse to essential prevention, protection, and support services. The latest UN Population Fund (UNFPA) projections suggest that due to the disruption of programmes to prevent FGM in response to COVID-19, 2 million cases might occur over the next decade that could have been averted. “The number of women unable to access family planning, facing unintended pregnancies, gender-based violence and other harmful practices could skyrocket by millions of cases”, warns UNFPA.Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG5, gender equality)—SDG 5.3 (eliminating FGM) in particular—is at stake. Preventing potential rises in FGM during the pandemic requires urgent attention. It also requires urgent action, including increases in funding and continuity in services during the pandemic. Access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including FGM prevention and care, are crucial—at anytime.The alarming signals of rising FGM cases are part of a broader context in which the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted women's wellbeing—from increases in domestic violence, to bearing an outsized burden of unpaid labour, and higher rates of unemployment. COVID-19 could erode progress made towards gender equality. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated responses are worsening existing gender and socioeconomic inequalities. There is an urgent need for concerted action in all sectors, including health, education, and economics. UNICEF, WHO, and UNFPA have highlighted the risks that the COVID-19 crisis pose to women and girls; they now need to do more to work together globally, regionally, and within countries. They have developed guidelines and recommendations, but now we need accountability. With less than a decade to go to achieve SDG 5.3—to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early, and forced marriage and FGM—we need annual monitoring and annual reviews to ensure that countries are held accountable for their progress. Protecting girls' health, education, and futures, and protecting them from FGM and other forms of gender-based violence, should not be a promise but a goal that countries should be accountable for, including during a pandemic.
The COVID-19 exit strategy—why we need to aim low/-/As we find ourselves in the second year of a global pandemic, the question on everyone's mind is: when will this end? Much of the narrative around the pandemic last year was that all hopes for a return to normal hinged on development of an effective vaccine. This rhetoric was deaf to the concerns of vaccine and public health experts, and for many a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has become the magic bullet to deliver us from endless cycles of lockdown and economic decline. Against all precedent, going into 2021, the world had several vaccines with demonstrated efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in its armamentarium. Yet a magic bullet they are not.Numerous issues and uncertainties surround the existing COVID-19 vaccines. We do not yet know the quality or length of protection the vaccines will provide and how effectively they will stop viral transmission. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations in key proteins threaten vaccine efficacy. Certain groups—eg, children, people with immunodeficiency, pregnant women, and elderly people—were not included, or were underrepresented, in vaccine trials, making the safety and efficacy in these groups less certain. Supply-chain constraints, pricing, and unequal vaccine procurement across countries mean that coverage across most, if not all, countries will remain below the level required for herd immunity—if such a level exists, another unknown. We can say that vaccines will make an important contribution to returning life to normal, but they should be only one part of an exit strategy.Certain countries that have relied on a suppression strategy for pandemic control, using non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce cases, hospital admissions, and deaths to so-called acceptable levels before lifting restrictions, appear to be entirely dependent on population-level herd immunity generated through natural infection or immunisation as an exit strategy. Public health messaging in these countries, which include most countries in Europe and the USA, is that we must both await the vaccines and become accustomed to living with the virus, as we have done with other viruses in the past. We should expect SARS-CoV-2 to become endemic and, potentially, seasonal. Infections will be concentrated in certain pockets of society that are non-immune, such as children who have not yet been vaccinated or adults with waning immunity. The virus might even become less virulent over time through accumulation of mutations and a selective pressure to become more transmissible as it adapts to humanity following the jump from the original animal host. However, even if these assumptions about the virus' trajectory hold true, they will happen over many months and years. In the meantime we must decide how best to ameliorate the detrimental effects of this deadly virus.Another strategy in use—to eliminate—has been deployed by countries that have been arguably the most successful in their responses to the pandemic: New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, and China. This strategy, which is proactive rather than reactive, resembles an exit strategy to a far greater extent than does the suppression strategy. It has a clear goal: to reduce community transmission to near zero through a highly stringent, but short-term, lockdown, followed by implementation of a well sized, robust, and coordinated find, test, trace, isolate, and support system, with the aim to identify and end outbreaks before they become unmanageable. Key to the success of this strategy is removal of structural inequalities that might lead to resurgences of the virus in certain marginalised populations. Benefits of this strategy have been multitudinous, including far fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths and in the long-term mitigated impacts on the economy and wellbeing of societies.Border closures and travel bans have been essential to limit reintroductions of the virus in countries pursuing an elimination strategy. However, borders cannot remain closed forever. A policy document from Germany paints a picture of how elimination across Europe might be sustainable, although the sentiments could be applied globally. The document proposes that areas in which SARS-CoV-2 has been eliminated are declared green zones in which civil liberties are restored. Strict contact and travel restrictions outside green zones remain, but the green zones expand as more and more regions achieve elimination. This strategy would require a global, coordinated response—so far absent from the pandemic—but if achieved would reap benefits. WHO is well positioned to lead such as response; however, to be successful, an elimination strategy will require individual governments to look beyond their own interests and commit to zero COVID.
Genomic sequencing in pandemics/-/Advanced genetic sequencing techniques have undoubtedly provided valuable information on the biology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Never have the nearly 30 000 nucleotides of a virus been so closely considered by scientists, public health experts, and politicians alike. But the use and application of genetic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has varied, risking an insufficient response to a rapidly changing pandemic.Knowledge of the virus's RNA sequence was key in characterising SARS-CoV-2 and early sharing of its genetic data enabled the rapid development of diagnostics. The expeditious production of vaccines also owes much to information gleaned from rapid sequencing.Additionally, sequencing combined with epidemiological data is providing real-time knowledge of the emergence of new variants and their biology. Three variants, recently identified, are of particular interest: variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK and now spreading worldwide; B.1.351 (N501Y.V2), first identified in South Africa and now also detected in the USA, the UK, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia; and P1—a descendant of variant B.1.1.28—first identified in Brazil. The situation remains worryingly dynamic. Some of these variants appear to be more easily transmitted, and there are reports that some vaccines are less efficacious against the B.1.351 variant. Vaccine roll-out will increase the possibility of other vaccine-escaping variants emerging. Mutations conferring resistance against several neutralising monoclonal antibodies—one authorised by the US FDA—and reducing the effectiveness of convalescent plasma have also been found. Public health responses will have to be tailored to such developments. The need to detect mutations associated with changes in the effectiveness of medical countermeasures is acute.Sequencing is set to increase. In the UK—heralded as the world leader in sequencing by Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock—the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium says that it will increase SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing to 20 000 per week by March, this year. WHO has called on African countries to “build and boost” genomic surveillance and has asked countries to ship at least 20 samples per month to sequencing laboratories, via a SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing network. In the USA, Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, has promised to scale up genomic surveillance.But globally, genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 remains patchy. Some patterns are unsurprising. According to GISAID, which promotes the sharing of genome sequence data in the COVID-19 pandemic, many high-income countries (such as Iceland, Luxembourg, and Japan) have sequenced the most viral genomes per 1000 cases, whereas the likes of Iraq and Venezuela have sequenced the fewest. Many countries, especially in Africa, have no sequencing data at all, indicating that there are profound disparities in the ability to sequence genomes.However, The Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone have a higher rate of sequencing than France, Italy, or the USA, suggesting that wealth is not the only determinant of capacity. Officials at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have written that Africa has been able to swiftly adapt to COVID-19 using technical know-how gleaned from other infectious disease outbreaks. Whatever the cause, large disparities in surveillance threaten all countries' ability to monitor and respond to the situation.What should an appropriate genomic surveillance system look like? First, it is probably unnecessary to sequence every patient's viral genome. But a sufficient level to detect and track mutations and their effects to inform public health responses should be a core capacity of health systems; both for COVID-19 and for future emerging and re-emerging infections.Second, sequencing hundreds of thousands of genomes alone is insufficient. An understanding is also needed of the effects of these changes on the virus's biology and to contextualise the findings with clinical data. This information then needs to be used to formulate appropriate and effective public health policy.Third, SARS-CoV-2 does not respect borders. Effective viral genomic surveillance needs to be a global concern. Sequences are being made available on several different databases, websites, and platforms, and an absence of standardised nomenclature for variants is contributing to a lack of clarity.Global genomic surveillance operating in real time is a key tool in the armamentarium of public health measures. In any outbreak it must be widely adopted, focused on seamless open data sharing, and form a foundation of the health response.
Valuing all lives equally: cancer surgery, COVID-19, and the NHS in crisis/-/As COVID-19 infections continue to increase at an unprecedented rate, and the UK enters the toughest phase of the pandemic so far, the National Health Service (NHS) finds itself under the most pressure seen in its 72-year history. With the majority of intensive care beds occupied by patients with COVID-19, Kings College Hospital in London was one of the first to take the drastic action to cancel urgent cancer surgeries. However, it is not alone, as other NHS hospitals in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cambridge, Essex, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, to name just a few, have also started to cancel urgent cancer surgeries.It would be prudent for the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to announce a regional approach to tackle cancelled surgeries in the various health trusts immediately. As some UK hospitals reach capacity, the implementation of an effective, centrally coordinated response from the NHS would be advantageous. Paramedics and other urgent care professionals are not uniformly empowered to refer patients to community or specialist services. Improving and connecting all referral pathways would help to facilitate an improved flow of patients to hospitals that are not yet at capacity.In addition to the hundreds of cancer operations being cancelled as hospitals are inundated with patients with COVID-19, more than 3800 patients with cancer in London are already waiting beyond the 62-day target for their first cancer treatment, and more than 1000 individuals needing urgent cancer surgery do not yet have a date for their treatment. Estimates suggest that in London alone, more than 500 patients with cancer need to be treated per week to stay on top of demand, but most hospitals that were meant to remain COVID-19-free are now compromised. The Nightingale hospitals, set up across the UK to help provide care for the anticipated increases in patients with COVID-19, are still not fully operational. Despite the cancellation of urgent cancer surgery, they are now being earmarked for recovering patients who are not ready to be discharged from hospital, as well as for mass COVID-19 vaccination centres. Staff recruitment is a major problem, and an urgent appeal has gone out for doctors and nurses to work at the Nightingale hospitals. If these emergency hospitals were staffed properly and used to their full potential, the impact of COVID-19 on cancer surgery might be reduced.While the NHS faces immense pressures from COVID-19, and with all but the most urgent elective activities, including cancer surgery, postponed, it is shocking that some non-time-critical elective care is continuing in the private sector. Unfortunately, unlike during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, the NHS is unable to make use of private sector capacity this time around. When the first lockdown began in March, 2020, all private providers in England were on an unprecedented national block contract with NHS England, to ensure that NHS patients who needed urgent surgery were prioritised over private patients with less urgent needs. However, two-thirds of the private sector capacity that was block-purchased by the NHS, costing hundreds of millions of pounds, went unused. With only a third of chemotherapy capacity used, despite grave concern about delays for some patients with cancer and general under-use, this arrangement ended in August, 2020. The Royal College of Surgeons has called on the Government to bring in the private sector again as a matter of urgency. Regrettably, this partnership has not been renewed because the UK Government is currently unwilling to fund NHS England to refer patients to a private sector that remains below capacity.The cost of cancelling urgent cancer surgery and the impact on lives cannot be underestimated. A COVIDSurg collaborative study published in May, 2020, predicted that during the 12-week peak disruption of hospital services caused by COVID-19 last year, at least 28 million elective operations were cancelled or postponed worldwide, including more than two million cancer operations. Delaying time-sensitive cancer surgery could lead to deteriorating health, worsening quality of life, and avoidable deaths. Even just a 4-week delay in cancer treatment increases the mortality risk by 4–8%. Despite the ongoing extraordinary efforts of all NHS staff, it is imperative that the COVID-19 crisis does not cause unmitigated suffering for the many people with cancer in the UK. The lives of all patients should have equal importance.
The Biden administration: changing the tide for health?/-/On Jan 20, 2021, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the USA. With over 430 000 deaths from COVID-19 (1314 deaths per million of the population), the country has been one of the worst hit globally, and the previous Trump administration was heavily criticised for its pandemic response. However, there is a sense of hope with the arrival of the new Biden administration, who have promised progress in managing the pandemic, as well as in environmental and health policy.On his first day as President, Biden re-joined the Paris Agreement, withdrew a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, re-joined WHO, and initiated proposals to regulate methane emissions. The climate change taskforce, appointed by Biden, is highly experienced both in terms of their environmental and international relations expertise. While Biden has been vocal about making climate change a top priority, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the world. Wildfires across the west of the country have been at their most severe in recent years, adding to the problem of climate change, and negatively affecting respiratory health. Biden will face an uphill struggle to ensure meaningful and lasting change to reduce the environmental and health burdens attributable to climate change.The most crucial and pressing hurdle for the new administration to address is the COVID-19 pandemic. A US$1·9 trillion investment from the US Government will help to guide the country out of the pandemic, with $400 billion directly dedicated to COVID-19 relief, including a national vaccination programme, and $1400 stimulus cheques being distributed to qualifying Americans. Measures such as improved ventilation will also enable schools to reopen once the R number is under control and vaccine rollout programmes have been more fully implemented, and paid emergency leave will permit people to stay at home when needed. Biden's ambitious plan to vaccinate 100 million Americans in 100 days is welcome, and he has taken steps to achieve effective distribution and administration. Unfortunately, some US states are running out of vaccine stocks and shortages are likely to be an ongoing problem. There have also been large disparities in distribution by local regions and states, some with more effective policies than others. A flexible approach that enables a quick response to these challenges will be needed if the vaccination programme is to succeed in quickly reducing mortality rates and easing pressure on US health systems.A robust effort to tackle misinformation about the perceived dangers of vaccination, to communicate clearly on the question of vaccine safety, and to understand and address vaccine hesitancy in some communities is also needed. There has been an unexpectedly poor uptake of the vaccine among US health-care workers, according to one cross-sectional study, with the majority (56% of 3479 responses) indicating that they would rather wait for more data to become available. Less than a fifth of black health-care workers would choose to have the vaccine, and acceptance in other minorities is worryingly low. Addressing vaccine hesitancy among Black and minority ethnic groups should be a priority for the new administration. Minority populations generally have less access to health care, are more likely to have chronic conditions, are less educated, have poorer housing, and are more likely to be essential workers—all of which contribute to increased risk of COVID-19 and worse outcomes. 70–75% of health-care workers were concerned about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and the speed with which they were approved. It is the responsibility of leaders in health care to reassure their employees that despite the unprecedented speed of vaccine development and approval, all the required protocols and safety checks were completed.The Biden administration has promised to confront health disparities, extending the Affordable Care Act and establishing a public option plan (similar to Medicare) to make affordable health care available to all, including those with pre-existing medical conditions. This is a huge step in the right direction for those with chronic respiratory conditions.“Science will always be at the forefront of my administration”—an encouraging statement from Biden, which gives a sense of hope that the new administration will take full advantage of existing and emerging knowledge to tackle health inequality, to collaborate globally on environmental and health frontiers, and to gain control over the COVID-19 pandemic. Only time will tell whether this promising start will be maintained throughout the next 4 years to promote the health of all Americans.
COVID-19 and mental health/-/While the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system remain unclear, there is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic is bad for mental health. To alleviate the impact of both the virus and the measures taken to control its spread, we need high quality information about their immediate and long-term effects, and which countermeasures are most effective. The good news is that by October, 2020, mental health was top of the charts in terms of published papers and preprints on the effects of COVID-19. The bad news is that the quantity of papers is not matched by quality. In March, 2020, Holmes and colleagues outlined the priorities for mental health research during the pandemic. How much have we learned since then?A post-mortem case series showed that the main effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain is through inflammation. Early case reports and the first paper from the UK CoroNerve surveillance platform described some new-onset psychosis, as well as patients with altered mental status, and others with cerebrovascular events. A study using US electronic health records found an increased incidence of a first diagnosis of psychiatric disorders within 90 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis, but the relation between cause and effect was uncertain. Studying the phenomenon of so-called long COVID might provide further information on the neurological effects of the virus, and its physical and mental consequences.For people with mental illness, database studies so far have produced contradictory findings: in South Korea, a history of mental illness was not associated with increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but patients with a history of severe mental illness had a slightly higher risk for severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 than patients without such a history. In the USA, a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder was associated with an increased risk for infection, which was exacerbated among African Americans and women, and a higher frequency of some adverse outcomes of the infection. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing policies and mental health services make international comparisons difficult: studies from other countries and on cohorts with specific disorders should help clarify the picture.Taking a broader view on the pandemic as a whole, Holmes and colleagues asked, what is the effect of COVID-19 on risk of mental illness? A plethora of cross-sectional online surveys of convenience samples have reported that people who respond to such surveys are anxious and depressed. Fortunately, longitudinal studies, several using established cohorts with pre-pandemic data for comparison, are starting to provide more detailed and reliable evidence, including how different groups are affected. For example, in the UK, mental distress was higher than expected when accounting for previous trends, particularly in people aged 18–34 years, women, and people living with young children. So far, in high-income countries, suicide does not seem to have increased, and researchers have warned about the possible harmful effects of overly dramatic and under-researched reporting on the subject. Although numerous stories have been published in newspapers, there are no reliable data for low-income and middle-income countries. Rigorous, national surveillance systems are needed to provide the basis for evidence-based services and prevention measures, because the economic consequences of the pandemic will be felt for many years.Holmes and colleagues also called for trials to determine the efficacy of mechanistically based digital and non-digital interventions and evaluate optimal models of implementation. Unfortunately, while many digital services have been introduced, few have been evaluated and too few seem to be mechanistically based. Similarly, while many hospitals have provided psychological support for health-care staff, reports of these are mainly descriptive. Research during a public health crisis is difficult but the Recovery trial showed that it could be done in the evaluation of treatments for COVID-19: a similarly ambitious programme is needed for mental health.Hopefully, the other questions identified by Holmes and colleagues are being addressed, such as how best to deliver mental health services for vulnerable groups, outreach methods to support those at risk of domestic abuse, how media consumption about COVID-19 influences mental health, and how to promote adherence to behavioural advice about COVID-19 while enabling mental wellbeing and minimising distress. For these to be addressed successfully, interventions must be informed by mental health science, evaluated impartially, and the outcomes shared.
COVID-19 and thrombosis: a continuing story/-/Celebrations to ring in 2021 were subdued in many parts of the world as traditional gatherings were cancelled to help stem the rising number of cases of COVID-19. The new, more transmissible, variants of the virus are causing pressure on health-care systems around the world and, although the positive results from numerous vaccine trials announced at the end of the year seemed to offer a glimmer of hope, it is clear now that there will be many more deaths before the disease is brought under control.What has been heartening is the speed at which research into COVID-19 has been undertaken. In the past year, over 1500 articles on COVID-19 and thrombosis have been published. Since our editorial last June, there have been some answers to the question of what role thrombosis plays in the severity of COVID-19. Early observational studies indicated that anticoagulation therapy was associated with improved outcomes for patients with severe disease. However, new evidence from the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial indicates that for patients with severe disease who required intensive care unit (ICU) support, therapeutic anticoagulation drugs did not improve outcomes and increased bleeding risk. The enrolment of these patients into the trial has been stopped, along with those in the ACTIV-4 and ATTACC trials, although patients who do not require ICU care at the time of enrolment will continue to be enrolled.It is clear that there is still much to be learnt regarding thrombosis and COVID-19. To help facilitate this research, guidelines have been developed by the International Society of Haemostasis and Thrombosis and the American Society of Hematology to help clinicians to report clotting and bleeding events associated with COVID-19 in a uniform manner. It is hoped that standardising reporting will lead to more opportunities to compare and pool data, which will be necessary to determine how best to treat patients with COVID-19 of different degrees of severity, and to determine whether the thrombosis seen is a direct consequence of infection with the virus or is a result of the inflammatory response.For the observational study see J Thromb Haemost 2020; 18: 1094–99

COVID-19 vaccination in haematology services/-/With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination programmes around the world, how and when to vaccinate individuals with haematological conditions becomes an increasingly pressing matter. Patients with haematological malignancies are at a high risk of infection because of immune deficiencies, which result from the underlying disease and specific therapies. Vaccination is possible for these patients, and their increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 compared with the general population, or even other patients with cancer, means they should be prioritised. Stem-cell transplantation makes the timing of vaccination even more important. Many patients will lose their immunity following transplantation, but can generally begin to be vaccinated around 3 months after the procedure. However, the new COVID-19 vaccines have not been tested in patients with haematological malignancies or those who have undergone transplantation, so it is not yet clear what level of protection and type of immune response will result from vaccination. Herd immunity from the general population might be what is required to ensure safety for these patients.For patients with other haematological conditions, such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, and rare inherited anaemias, the general consensus is that being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be beneficial, and that these people should be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available to them. For individuals with bleeding disorders who are receiving treatment to reduce bleeding, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such treatment. For those being treated with anticoagulation, there should be no contraindication for receiving an intramuscular vaccine, although patients receiving warfarin with a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) should wait until their INR is below 4.Although it is hoped that COVID-19 vaccines will change the tide of the pandemic, much work is still to be done to understand the disease. It will take time before there is sufficient global distribution of the various vaccines to control the pandemic, and careful monitoring of those with haematological conditions is imperative.
Technology: the nexus of climate change and COVID-19?/-/We are in the midst of dual crises: COVID-19 and climate change. Both have led to a substantial loss of life, disproportionately affected vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals, and pushed some health-care systems to the maximum. The 2020 report of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change emphasises the need for responses to these crises to be aligned, in order to tackle them successfully. What role can technology play in helping us win these battles?From satellite-based surveillance systems to climate models, technology has proven essential for quantifying how the environment is changing, and these innovative approaches have provided a foundation from which the effects of climate change on health can be understood and mitigated. For example, advances in sensor technology and computational modelling allow air quality to be monitored in near real time. Data can be leveraged on an individual basis through wearables (such as the personal AirSpeck), or on a large scale (such as by the London Air Quality Network), to monitor and predict levels of air pollution and act as an early warning system for those most vulnerable to high levels of pollution. Monitoring pollution is pivotal because modelling studies from the USA and other regions have shown that historically higher exposure to the air-borne pollutant PM2·5 is positively associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates (although the association could be confounded by individual-level risk factors such as ethnicity).Aside from air quality, studying the influence of meteorology on the virus could help predict seasonal variation in its transmission. “Since SARS-CoV-2 has emerged only recently as a human pathogen, there is still uncertainty as to whether its transmission will vary seasonally in different parts of the world” says Associate Professor Rachel Lowe from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “If modelling studies reveal sufficient evidence that seasonality in COVID-19 transmission is linked to meteorological variables like temperature and humidity, weather forecasts could be used to provide early warnings of increased risk and support response strategies.”To further mitigate the health effects of climate change, technology can help health-care systems reduce their carbon footprint. NHS Digital set out its Sustainability Development Management Plan in 2017, aiming to become more energy efficient. The 2019–2020 update report reveals that NHS Digital is making good progress, which is potentially aided by COVID-19 necessitating reduction in travel and the use of remote offerings such as the algorithm-based triage system NHS Pathways.Nick Watts, NHS Chief Sustainability Officer, says, “In 2020 the NHS published the Delivering a ‘Net Zero’ National Health Service report detailing the ambition to become the first Net Zero health system. The report recognises digital transformation is key to delivering low carbon models of care. Developed in close coordination with NHS Digital, the arrival of the strategy will require refreshed ambition and focus as the system moves more squarely into delivery.”The Net Zero plan highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine learning for developing diagnostic tools and more efficient systems. But whilst people do not often consider the environmental impact of technological innovation, AI does in fact have a big carbon footprint, and data storage and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms can generate substantial carbon emissions. These costs have ignited a movement called green AI, calling for more environmentally friendly approaches such as lower-energy hardware and encouraging researchers to use tools for tracking and calculating machine-learning energy consumption and carbon emissions and report these results in publications for full transparency. It is vital that those working in this space adopt lower carbon approaches as the number of data-driven methods and the range of digital services available continues to increase.Clearly, technology could have a role to play in the battles against climate change and COVID-19, arming us with real-time information on environmental conditions, and revealing associations between these conditions and disease susceptibility. Technology also showcases how health-care systems can be adapted to support sustainability. However, these potential gains might be overshadowed by poor practice, unless the research community adopts more carbon-friendly and transparent approaches. Technology presents an arsenal of tools to fight these dual crises, but sustainability needs to be at the heart of each method.
Too long to wait: the impact of COVID-19 on elective surgery/-/As health-care systems worldwide scrambled to cope with the first wave of COVID-19, many countries made the necessary decision to cancel all non-emergency surgical procedures to free up personnel and resources to care for patients with COVID-19. Nearly 10 million people in the UK are now waiting for surgical procedures, up from 4 million before the pandemic hit. Among them are nearly 100 000 patients whose joint replacement surgeries were cancelled during the first COVID-19 wave, many of whom are left struggling with daily activities because of severe pain and limited mobility. The UK is not alone in this dilemma; a US report projected a backlog of more than 1 million joint and spinal surgeries by mid-2022. Drastic measures will be required to clear these backlogs.Although elective surgeries resumed in the UK (and many other countries) in mid-2020, most hospitals are functioning at substantially reduced capacity, which translates to an ever-lengthening waitlist. As of September, 2020, nearly 140 000 patients in England alone had been waiting for more than a year for their surgeries—100 times the number in 2019. And with a new, highly transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the UK, resulting in a third national lockdown and further cancellations, patients now face even longer waits.The most common indication for joint replacement surgery is osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide. The disease—ranked by WHO among the top ten most disabling diseases in high-income countries—often causes debilitating pain that disrupts mobility and interferes with daily activities; living with chronic pain is also strongly associated with substance abuse and impaired mental health. Indeed, clinical depression has been reported in up to 90% of patients with axial pain due to orthopaedic conditions and in 60% of those waiting for knee replacement surgery.Nonetheless, among the millions awaiting surgical procedures, those with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis might seem a lesser priority compared with patients suffering from other conditions, such as cancer. Indeed, nearly 4000 cancer patients are currently waiting beyond the 3-week target to start treatment, which could substantially increase cancer deaths (eg, delayed treatment of patients in England with breast, colorectal, oesophageal, and lung cancers alone is projected to result in more than 3000 additional avoidable deaths within 5 years).It will undoubtedly take many years to grasp the totality of the consequences of delayed joint replacement surgeries, both with regard to long-term health outcomes for patients and costs to health systems and societies. And although it may not be an immediate life-or-death situation, the suffering of these patients cannot be ignored. Orthopaedists and rheumatologists caution that delaying surgery in patients with the most severe disease can lead to more complicated surgeries, increased use of medications, more difficult recovery, and worse outcomes, including increased rates of revision surgery and reduced quality of life. A recent study projected 50% greater odds of worse outcomes when surgery is delayed by more than 6 months—far less time than thousands of patients have already waited. Another concern is increased use of opioids, which even before the COVID-19 pandemic was reported in up to one fifth of patients awaiting arthroplasty, despite evidence that this leads to poorer outcomes.The UK charity Versus Arthritis recently launched its ‘Impossible to Ignore’ campaign, demanding that UK governments and policy makers do not ignore the needs of patients with arthritis during the ongoing pandemic. The campaign calls for clear plans to reduce joint replacement waiting lists safely, to ensure that patients get the communication, support, and advice they need to manage their pain, and to involve patients in plans to restart services. Recent recommendations from the European Hip Society and European Knee Associates outline considerations on how to reintroduce elective arthroplasty surgery safely in the wake of COVID-19; they emphasise the need to assess the impact of delaying hip and knee arthroplasty for patients and for society, along with assessing when these procedures can safely resume, and how to prioritise patients.Extended wait times for elective surgeries is but one of the myriad problems facing health-care systems as they struggle to manage patients with non-COVID illnesses during the ongoing pandemic—problems that do not have simple solutions. But even when the immediate stakes are not life-or-death, the long-term costs to patients, health systems, and society are high. These patients should not, and cannot, be ignored.
Ageing in a post COVID world/-/On Jan 15, 2021, the UK Government's House of Lords’ Science and Technology Select Committee published a damning report into the state of healthy ageing in the UK. Although the report focused on the UK, many of the issues raised are universal. The Committee found that there “has been a lack of leadership and planning” for the 2017 Ageing Society Grand Challenge which aimed to “ensure that people can enjoy at least five extra healthy, independent years of life by 2035, while narrowing the gap between the experience of the richest and poorest”. Instead, “minimal progress” has been made, with people “living longer, but many of those extra years…spent in poor health.” And this is not taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to disproportionately greater numbers of excess mortality in older people.Many of the societal and medical issues flagged in the report have been exacerbated by the pandemic. For example, the need to promote and support lifelong digital skills training, including providing such support to a large proportion of the current older population, is reflected in the barriers technological illiteracy is causing in vaccine access even in high-income countries. An article in the New York Times, also published Jan 15, emphasises the difficulties in obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine for older people in New York. Because the USA does not have a central health-care service provider, vaccine delivery is fragmented, with providers and payee systems all requiring complicated online registration, despite older people being much less likely to be technologically engaged. In the USA, many older people have had to turn to friends and family for support in figuring out the online systems to obtain the vaccine, a development which runs the gamut of being frustrating for some, creating damaging feelings of dependency for others, or, worst of all, leading to some people missing out on the vaccine entirely.Another issue raised in the Report (which has been worsened by the pandemic) is inequalities of healthy ageing outcomes. As in almost all parts of society, ethnicity and socioeconomic status dictate widely varying outcomes, including in access to enabling technology, palliative care provision, and health-care engagement. The 10-year follow-up to the Marmot Review—an assessment of health equity in England—which was published in February, 2020, found that “there are clear socioeconomic gradients in preventable mortality” with the poorest areas of England having the highest rates of preventable mortality. An August, 2020 assessment by Public Health England found that “[the pandemic] has replicated existing health inequalities and, in some cases, has increased them.”The House of Lords Report ends with many calls for action, many of which are admirably nuanced calls for further research into ageing. One emphasises the under-funding of research into the basic mechanisms of ageing, as opposed to age-related diseases, which they find might have contributed to poor translation of basic research into clinical medicine. Another flags the routine exclusion of older people from clinical trials, even those trials which directly address ageing and age-related diseases. Finally, there is a call for further interventional studies to establish which social and environmental factors can affect health in older age.While these recommendations are welcomed, none of the findings and recommendations laid out in the Report are new to those in the ageing research community. Furthermore, they are issued against a concerning backdrop in which care rationing has become necessity in some parts of the world as health-care systems become overwhelmed by the pandemic, with some countries deciding on health-care allocation by patient age. The British Geriatric Society has launched a ‘Fair Care’ campaign, one strand of which emphasises that older people have as much right to treatment as any other.For the Report to have the effect that it should, policymakers need to follow good intentions with legal frameworks, funding, and willpower. There is no us and them, no young and old: we are all in a continuum. Achieving older life should be something that we aspire to and celebrate, not fear. The pandemic has made ageing well harder. But a society that treats all its members equally and fairly irrespective of age will also be one that comes back stronger from all adversity. The time to invest is now.
Health and care workers are owed a better future/-/It has been a traumatic and testing year for the health and care workforce globally. In recognition of their contribution and struggles during the pandemic response, WHO has designated 2021 as the International Year of Health and Care Workers. This campaign highlights the need for investment in health workforce readiness, education, and learning to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, to maintain health services, and to prepare for vaccine roll-outs. A call for action on behalf of the health-care workforce is welcome. What must also be considered is a governmental duty to sufficiently protect the health-care workforce, be that protection from infection, protection of mental health, or legal protection. Governments should be asking themselves whether they are fulfilling this duty of care.Amid the strain the pandemic is placing on health systems, the health-care workforce is experiencing serious harms to their physical and mental wellbeing while trying to deliver quality care. These issues are not limited to clinicians and nursing staff, but affect everyone working to improve health in their community, including in care homes, pharmacies, and residential centres. International data are scarce, but according to Amnesty International, more than 7000 health workers worldwide had died from COVID-19 by September, 2020. Although health and care workers represent less than 3% of the population in most countries, they make up 14% of the COVID-19 cases reported to WHO. These statistics are sobering, but statistics alone cannot tell the full story of a workforce that feels a palpable sense of anger. Nor can they illustrate the sorrow and mental burden of health and care workers who see colleagues, friends, and family suffer from the virus while making personal sacrifices to deliver the best care they possibly can.Health and care workers should be prioritised for vaccination. However, there are several concerns. There are uncertainties, such as that surrounding the effect of vaccination on transmission, and in some countries the health-care workforce is being given vaccines for which efficacy data have not been published. In the UK, the government has decided to extend the gap between doses to 12 weeks. According to the BBC, this approach has been questioned by the British Medical Association in a letter to Chris Whitty, the government's chief medical adviser, warning that “the absence of any international support for the UK's approach is a cause of deep concern and risks undermining public and the profession's trust in the vaccination programme“. Efficacy and vaccine effectiveness might also differ in light of the new variants circulating. There are concerning reports in some places of wariness among health and care workers to take COVID-19 vaccines, although it is unclear why.Vaccination is not the limit of government duty to the health and care workforce. Other immediate concerns should be addressed to ensure their safety. It is a serious issue that obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE) of an appropriate standard remains a problem a full year into the pandemic, with recent calls in the UK to update PPE guidelines to better tackle more transmissible variants going unheeded. A recent survey for National Nurses United in the USA suggests that 80% of nurses report reusing at least one type of single-use PPE.The best way to protect health and care workers in the long term is to address the substantial shortfall in the workforce worldwide. Shortages have put huge pressure on staff during the pandemic and hampered responses. There were not enough health and care workers before COVID-19, with an estimated 18 million person shortfall, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Governments can build countless emergency hospitals and buy thousands of ventilators, but without the workforce to operate them, they are useless. WHO estimates that 40 million new jobs in health and social care are required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. A vast number of trained vaccination workers are also needed now and for the foreseeable future. Governments must put in place long-term spending plans that invest sensibly in the training and employment of health and care workers to meet these needs.The social contract between health-care workers and the public is at risk if the health workforce cannot be properly protected and the duty of care to them fulfilled. The lack of sufficient protections given to health and care staff during the pandemic makes it impossible to properly respond to COVID-19 and makes the sector a far less appealing one to work in, jeopardising its long-term security. A health-care system cannot function by relying solely on the good nature of its workforce and their sense of duty in the face of extreme adversity.
COVID-19: the intersection of education and health/-/What lessons does the COVID-19 syndemic offer when considering the convergence between health and education? The International Day of Education, on Jan 24, provides an opportunity to reflect on the weaknesses of the education system before COVID-19, and on the impact of school closures and education disruptions on children and adolescents. Since March, 2020, more than 1·5 billion students worldwide—an unprecedented number—have been affected by school or university closures. The implications of these closures are enormous. In addition to the loss of learning, a lack of access to school means that many children lose protection from hazards such as domestic violence and child abuse, others lose access to the only nutritious meal of their day, and many will miss immunisations that are often given at school. Furthermore, school closures deprive children and adolescents of social and emotional experiences essential for their development and wellbeing.Adolescents are particularly affected by both closures and by distance learning in higher education. In the short term, some students are leaving school to find work earlier than they might otherwise have; others might be experiencing mental health problems such as loneliness and anxiety. In the long term, there is a danger that hard-won progress in secondary school attendance in low-income and middle-income countries will be reversed. And it is not only schools that shape education. Cultural events, sport, and religion have been disrupted, in many countries for almost a year. Under lockdowns, children who have not yet reached school age have been forced to remain at home, and low levels of stimulation during a child's early years are likely to have far-reaching consequences for their development. Health and education are bidirectionally linked: a good-quality education is an investment for health, and health is essential for effective learning. These disruptions to education, and the subsequent widening of inequalities in learning, will adversely affect the health of this generation and their children.The disproportionate effect of school closures on girls and poorer students is especially concerning—millions of children are predicted to drop out of school (the humanitarian analysis organisation ACAPS says 24 million; Save the Children estimates 9·7 million). Many educational institutions have re-established their programmes online to mitigate short-term interruptions in learning. However, the effects of a digital divide and intangible losses of cognitive and social skills cannot be easily repaired. The economic crisis is pushing poor households into greater poverty, with families turning to early marriage as an alternative form of income. This predicament further perpetuates intergenerational poverty and inequality. Education is the only ladder out of poverty for many children and adolescents, and it is crucial to empower girls to economic independence and resist violation of their rights.Education systems will be most beneficial when they provide more than a curriculum in science, maths, languages, and other academic subjects. Programmes that better support the cognitive and behavioural skills of children—self-reliance, decision making, anxiety management, communication, and assertiveness—will enable them to thrive. Traditional educational skills need to be expanded to encompass training in sexual and reproductive health and rights, child nutrition, and mental health.This conceptual change in the value of education needs to start at the national level with revitalised education programmes. There is evidence that holistic approaches to education that value health and wellbeing can be effective. But their success is dependent on the political will to implement and support them. For example, the Health Promoting Schools approach developed by WHO values schools as social communities inclusive of students, teachers, and families; however, WHO reports that few countries have successfully implemented it at scale. This approach is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for health (SGD3) and quality education (SDG4), which explicitly acknowledge the linkage between health and education. Yet, the two sectors remain distant; arguments over whether to close schools to prevent infection can even imply that they are in opposition. This disconnect needs to be remedied. Closer cooperation would revitalise not only education, but also child and adolescent health.For more on the number of students impacted by the pandemic see https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse

Do not repeat mistakes from HIV in COVID-19 response/-/40 years since the first cases of HIV were identified, we often reflect in these pages about the enormous advances that have been made to combat the disease. From the vantage point of 2021 there is a lot to celebrate: an unknown virus identified, characterised, and sequenced; treatments developed and refined; health systems strengthened to deliver those treatments; an HIV response that has shaped health systems and global health. However, when considered alongside the rapid response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 the HIV response seems practically sluggish.In just 1 year, the virus responsible for the pandemic that currently grips the world has been identified and characterised, treatments (albeit imperfect) have been implemented to save lives, and, crucially, at the start of 2021, several vaccines are being rolled out after astonishingly rapid development, progress through the clinical-trial process, and approval. Now, a few weeks into 2021, millions of people have received their first doses and protection against the virus will begin to drive down incidence of COVID-19 and save lives. In Israel, for example, where almost 9 million people, a quarter of the adult population, have received the Pfizer vaccine, people expect to begin to see the effects of vaccination on the epidemic soon. But as many celebrate the remarkable progress in combatting SARS-CoV-2, a concerning pattern is beginning to emerge that is all too familiar to those who have worked in HIV: inequitable distribution.Although HIV programmes worldwide are now seeing rapid scale-up of treatment access, this was not always the case. Less than a decade ago, access to treatment was massively skewed in favour of people in high-income countries with lower burden; and even as treatment access was scaled up, while people with HIV in richer countries had access to the newest, most effective, and least harmful treatments, people in the poorest countries had patchy access, sometimes to outdated treatments. And even today, inequalities remain in access to treatment, prevention, care, and testing.Similar imbalances are emerging at the time of writing in the early days of coronavirus vaccination. For example, whereas 25% of people with Israeli identity cards have received the Pfizer vaccine, none of 4 million Palestinians has received a dose of vaccine. Worldwide, around 45 million people have received vaccine, but so far, almost every single one has been given in high-income countries.Speaking on the day of the 148th Executive Board meeting of WHO, Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the “world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure, and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries”. As countries scramble for access to vaccines with the hope of breaking out of the cycles of epidemic flare-ups and economically damaging lockdowns and high mortality from coronavirus, vaccine prices could be pushed up as richer countries try to jump to the front of the queue. A “me-first approach would be self-defeating”, said Ghebreyesus.In April last year, James Hargreaves and colleagues wrote a Comment, Three lessons for the COVID-19 response from pandemic HIV, published in this journal. The first lesson was to anticipate and address inequitable responses and specifically referenced the need for fair access to vaccines. WHO's COVAX programme was set up to ensure that 2 billion of the world's poorest people will have access to vaccines by the end of 2021.But despite clear warnings and efforts to ensure equitable access, vaccine procurement is off to a biased start. Countries such as Australia and Canada have purchased many more vaccines than their populations need, and alongside Israel, other countries such as Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the USA have raced out of the gates in terms of vaccine delivery. Countries with more money have more immediate access to vaccines.
Realising the potential of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines—a long shot?/-/The race to develop safe, effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced impressive results. As of Jan 18, 2021, 64 vaccines were in clinical development according to the WHO COVID-19 candidate vaccine database. Phase 3 data for two RNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford University/AstraZeneca) have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and further phase 3 reports are expected imminently. Although the start of mass vaccination programmes should be celebrated, many challenges lie ahead in reaching eligible recipients and protecting those at risk from COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.The UK was quick off the mark: BNT162b2 was approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency on Dec 2, 2020, followed by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA-1273, and more than 4 million people have received a first vaccine dose. But the UK's decision to give the second dose of BNT162b2 up to 12 weeks after the first—a delay introduced to allow more individuals to receive their first shot—has met with controversy, with Pfizer stressing that efficacy was tested with two doses given just 21 days apart. Delays in the delivery of BNT162b2 are currently affecting the UK and other European countries as Pfizer ramps up its production capacity, and limited supply of approved vaccines is likely to be an ongoing problem.Other countries hit hard by COVID-19 have announced ambitious plans. On Jan 16, 2021, India launched its programme with the goal of reaching 300 million people by August, 2021. The country has approved the use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and the whole-virion inactivated vaccine BBV152 (Bharat Biotech); however, there are fears that the rapid approval of BBV152, phase 3 results for which are not expected until March, 2021, might undermine confidence and add to the growing problem of vaccine hesitancy in India. India has huge vaccine-manufacturing capacity and both will be produced locally, but whether the challenges of reaching priority groups can be overcome remains to be seen. For many low-income and middle-income countries, the task ahead is formidable, with concerns about the availability and affordability of vaccines. International initiatives such as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility aim to promote the equitable distribution of safe and efficacious vaccines.Natural or vaccine-induced immunity has been a key focus of research since the start of the pandemic. Scientists worked quickly to describe the adaptive response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neutralising antibody and T-cell subsets. However, the duration of protection after infection is still uncertain and reinfection has been reported. The hope is that vaccines will provide lasting benefits, but careful monitoring will be needed to establish the durability of protection. Other priorities for research include the identification of immune correlates of asymptomatic or mild versus more severe disease, which could pave the way to new therapeutic approaches, and better mapping of protective epitopes to allow the fine-tuning of vaccine design and further development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The long-term safety and efficacy of vaccines will need to be studied in diverse populations.The ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to prevent infection or ongoing transmission remains unclear. The impact of immunisation on hospital admissions will be an important focus as countries aim to keep health-care systems running and protect those most at risk of severe disease in the face of high levels of transmission. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are a cause for concern. New variants include B.1.1.7, which recently emerged in the UK, B.1.351, and P.1. These lineages appear to be more transmissible than previous strains, although there is currently no evidence that they cause more severe disease or compromise the efficacy of available vaccines. Surveillance is needed to detect escape variants at an early stage. New variants also emphasise the ongoing need for public health mitigation strategies and add to the urgency of vaccine rollout across the globe.Despite the promise of vaccination programmes and related research efforts, it will be months before the benefits start to be felt globally. In the meantime, a redoubling of efforts is needed to stem the transmission of COVID-19; to better understand the pathophysiology and clinical features of acute illness and the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection; and to address the clinical needs of patients through evidence-based treatment and management strategies.View Large Image

An exceptional vaccination policy in exceptional circumstances/-/Just as hope for relief from the COVID-19 pandemic brightened in December, with emergency use approval for vaccines following phase 3 trials and the start of immunisation programmes, unprecedented numbers of cases, hospital admissions, and deaths have been recorded, including in countries such as Germany and Japan that were previously celebrated for their public health response. Predictions that the northern hemisphere winter would be a difficult time for control of COVID-19, as is typically the case with respiratory viral diseases, have proved to be correct. Emergence in South Africa and the UK of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are substantially more transmissible, has added to concerns that health services will be overwhelmed.Alarm over the rapid rise in cases led to an unexpected policy twist in the UK on Dec 30: on top of a third national lockdown, the chief medical officers of the four nations of the UK announced that the second dose of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should be given at up to 12 weeks after the first dose rather than the recommended interval of 3–4 weeks, on the basis of advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). While supplies of vaccine remain limited, the JCVI recommends “initially prioritising delivery of the first vaccine dose as this is highly likely to have a greater public health impact in the short term and reduce the number of preventable deaths from COVID-19”. The rationale is that if 95% of people are protected from disease after two doses (as determined in the phase 3 trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine) and 90% after one dose (JCVI estimate), then 19 of 20 people will be protected by two doses but when given as single doses to 40 people 36 will be protected. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation has advised that the interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be up to 6 weeks in “exceptional epidemiological circumstances”. The Canadian province of British Columbia will extend the vaccine interval to 5 weeks, and other countries are reported to be considering extending the dosing interval while awaiting delivery of more vaccine.Given that vaccine approval is based on a dosing interval of 3 or 4 week, that efficacy of single doses was not formally tested in randomised trials, and that estimated efficacy of single doses is based on unplanned analyses of few data from these trials, the decision to prioritise the first dose has naturally drawn criticism. The British Medical Association described the decision as “unreasonable and totally unfair”, pointing out the logistical difficulties in rebooking vaccination appointment for the elderly and vulnerable people who have already received their first immunisation. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the US vaccination programme would proceed with the approved two-dose schedule, noting the lack of data on extending the period to the second immunisation.An important concern is the durability of immunity in the extended dosing interval. Some COVID-19 cases after the first vaccine dose are inevitable among people infected around the time of immunisation—as was observed in clinical trials—because protective immunity takes about 2 weeks to become established. However, if immunity wanes during the interval between doses, post-vaccination infections will be more common, thus reducing the impact of—and public confidence in—the vaccination programme. As John Roberts and colleagues point out, duration of immunity to viral spike protein induced by mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna ones is unknown, and in animal models neutralising antibody production falls at about 28 days from first vaccination. By contrast, these authors note that for viral-vector vaccines (eg, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1), there is evidence to support an extended interval between doses. Another unknown is whether potentially suboptimal immunity will foster evolution of vaccine-escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, some reassurance comes from a report that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine produces antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 carrying the N501Y mutation found in the South African and UK variants.Independent SAGE, a group of UK scientists not known for their support of government COVID-19 policy, has endorsed the decision “to pursue coverage of as high a proportion of the population as possible, as quickly as possible”, noting that it must be part of a comprehensive strategy that includes prospective evaluation of different dosing intervals. Given the urgent need to suppress a rise in cases caused by a new viral variant, we believe that extending the dosing interval is an expedient, short-term decision while there are constraints on vaccine supply.
Vitamin D and COVID-19: why the controversy?/-/“To help retain the peak of sunny summer health—to help maintain rugged resistance to winter colds and sickness—drink Schlitz [beer], with Sunshine Vitamin D”, reads an advertisement in the American Magazine from December, 1936.The fascination with vitamin D supplementation began with the discovery in the early 1920s that vitamin D prevented rickets and was further driven by the recognition of other potential roles of vitamin D in non-skeletal outcomes, including immune function, cardiovascular health, and cancer. However, whereas data on the function of vitamin D in bone growth and maintenance is clear-cut and has informed practical clinical guidelines and public health policies over the years, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in other health and disease processes, in particular in acute respiratory tract infection, remains patchy. Data from observational studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation can lower the odds of developing respiratory infections, particularly in vitamin D-deficient groups, but randomised trials have yielded mixed results.In The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, the findings from a prespecified analysis from the D-Health randomised clinical trial in more than 20 000 Australian adults recruited from the general population suggest that monthly doses of vitamin D did not reduce the risk or severity of acute respiratory tract infections. Although the analysis showed a statistically significant effect on the overall duration of symptoms based on analysis of diary data, the reduction was small (0·5 days) and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. In a preprint deposited on MedRxiv, the authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis based on aggregate data from trials, including data from the D-Health trial, concluded that vitamin D supplementation was safe and identified a small effect with respect to protection from acute respiratory tract infections associated with daily doses of 400–1000 IU vitamin D for up to 12 months, but acknowledged significant heterogeneity across trials.The issue of vitamin D supplementation has been extensively debated, with strong arguments in favour and against. The COVID-19 pandemic has further escalated the discussion. It has long been clear that groups that traditionally exhibit vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, such as older adults and nursing home residents, and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic populations, are the same groups that have also been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, increased time spent indoors due to strict lockdowns and shielding triggered concerns that some people might not obtain the necessary physiological levels of vitamin D from sunlight.On Dec 17, 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in collaboration with Public Health England and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, published an updated rapid review of recent studies on vitamin D and COVID-19. Their recommendations support the current government advice, revised in April, 2020, during the first lockdown in the UK, for everyone to take vitamin D supplements to maintain bone and muscle health during the autumn and winter months. The recommendations are also in line with new guidance from the UK government, released on Dec 22, 2020, allowing extremely clinically vulnerable people to opt in to receive a free 4-month supply of daily vitamin D supplements—similar to an initiative launched earlier in Scotland. However, the rapid review concluded that sufficient evidence to support vitamin D supplementation with the aim of preventing or treating COVID-19 was still lacking and that the topic should be further investigated. Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway. However, particularly in countries where the pandemic situation continues to worsen (and will continue to do so during the winter months before the effects of vaccinations become perceptible), additional evidence could come in just too late. In an ideal world, all health decisions would be made based on overwhelming evidence, but a time of crisis may call for a slightly different set of rules.
Health as a foundation for society/-/In 2020, a virus that thrived on chronic disease and inequality became the great revealer. COVID-19 revealed the fragility of civilisations built on social injustices, short-term policies, and a dangerous disregard for the environment. The need to become more resilient to crises of all kinds is almost universally agreed on. But to construct that resilience, a philosophical change in how we care for each other and our environment must be made. Health improvement is the guiding principle to lead a recovery away from regressive policies that harm the most vulnerable (and will result in future catastrophes) and point us towards change that supports equity and sustainability, and reinvigorates the Sustainable Development Goal agenda.Societies start and end with the collective security of the planet. Climate stabilisation must be the cornerstone of the 2020s and beyond, closely entwined with equity. Equity for now, but also for future generations. 2020 was supposed to be the year that The Lancet focused on child and adolescent health, but many of our initiatives were delayed. 2021 demands renewed activity. The Lancet Countdown on climate and health and our 2020 WHO–UNICEF–Lancet Commission, A future for the world's children?, will continue to investigate the impacts of the climate crisis on health and the type of environment that young people can expect to inherit, ahead of COP26.Countries might justifiably start to look inward to repair the damage after COVID-19. But equitable access, whether to a vaccine, food, or finance, will require global collaboration. The health community should nurture and encourage multilateral partnerships, in which countries share responsibility for each other, as the best way to build strong and just institutions. A complex, synergistic relationship exists between the environment, conflict, migration, and equity, in which the desire for good health is a common denominator. As reported in a World Report, a record number of people will require humanitarian assistance in 2021. The Lancet will publish a Series on women and children living in conflict-affected areas (representing over half of all women and children), and a standing Commission on migration and health will investigate these dynamic relationships.COVID-19 has proven that the economic and political success of individual countries is founded on the health of its population. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the USA has made clear where the Trump administration's lack of public health response and espousal of health-harming policies have accelerated negative outcomes. A forthcoming Lancet Commission on public policy and health in the Trump era will serve as a call to action for the new Biden administration to refresh the way health is valued in the USA. Without health, there is no productivity, no GDP, no trade, and no education.The case for universal health coverage has never been clearer; yet it has not guaranteed success against COVID-19. The UK NHS is a renowned universal health-care system, but years of underfunding and short-term political agendas have led to an unnecessarily poor response to COVID-19. The Lancet Commission on the NHS will be published in early 2021 and explores how a system run on efficiency and restricted resources has resulted in a lag in life expectancy and infant mortality compared with other high-income countries. Health-care systems will need to prioritise resilience and sustainability to overcome the collective challenges of shifting demographics, climate change, and increased demand.This week, a Health Policy piece in The Lancet scrutinises the disparities between a global health security agenda and fragmented universal health coverage systems. It indicates that a new understanding of preparedness must develop—one that appreciates that the baseline level of health in a population dictates how well a country will fare in a crisis. New Zealand and Germany are examples of countries whose sustained investment in the health of their people has paid off during COVID-19.In 2020, death featured as a shared human experience. The Lancet Commission on the value of death argues for a reanalysis of dying. How populations collectively value the health of individual lives (and deaths), irrespective of age or economic activity, prime a society's overarching ideology and predicate the humanity and identity of a state. For a long time, health has been considered by politicians as secondary to other aspects of governing: an added bonus that can be moulded, a budget that can be reallocated, a policy that can be sidelined, instead of the driving force of a functioning economy. In 2021, The Lancet will continue to put social justice at the centre of our work, and we will strengthen our commitment to argue for health as a foundational value and outcome for all other aspects of society.
Pandemics and the health of a nation/-/In its November, 2020, report, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that the British economy will have contracted by 11% by the end of 2020—the largest decrease since the Great Frost of 1709. This double-digit fall in gross domestic product (GDP) reflects the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the UK Government has spent more than £280 billion on supporting the economy, jobs, schools, and health system. Among high-income countries, this represents one of the largest increases in debt, second only to Canada. To pay for this, UK public borrowing reached approximately £400 billion in 2020 or 19% of GDP—the highest annual rate since World War 1 and 2. The UK's economic outlook is bleak, with the economy unlikely to return to anything close to the levels seen before COVID-19 until 2024 at the earliest, and that is before the unknown consequences of Brexit play out. Although the UK's situation is unique, most of the world's economies are also facing deep pandemic recessions, with far-reaching consequences.In an analysis of historical data done by the UK newspaper, The Independent, recessions inflict large health and societal problems. During the banking crisis and 2008–13 recession, clinical depression and anxiety increased in the UK, especially among 16–24 year olds; suicide rates increased by 16%; obesity soared; binge drinking (particularly among those who lost their jobs) increased; and widescale changes in diet, smoking, and exercise drove up rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Reported in The Lancet in 2016 by Mahiben Maruthappu and colleagues, the recession was estimated to have caused at least 260 000 excess cancer deaths in countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The consequences of the pandemic recession globally, coupled with Brexit in the UK and (to a lesser extent) in the EU, will far exceed the excess cancer mortality seen in the recession. The reasons for this are that the cause of the problem is far bigger, affecting not just personal behaviours, but also the physical infrastructure of health systems, which has already caused vast numbers of missed cancer diagnoses; paused screening services; interrupted cancer treatments; and non-evidence-based modifications to cancer interventions.Public health services are vital in times of crisis. Recklessly, in August, 2020, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that Public Health England (PHE) would be disbanded and its function integrated into a new organisation called the National Institute for Health Protection. Cancer Research UK have highlighted the dangers of this decision on cancer care. PHE is currently responsible for cancer prevention by providing expert support for local governments to run prevention campaigns and services. PHE also helps to design, implement, and review national screening programmes for breast, bowel, and cervical cancer, as well as being responsible for collecting, analysing, and looking after data in the national cancer registry. These are vital roles, and now—of all times—is not the moment for radical reform of public health in England if it threatens continuity of these functions and centralises activities that are best understood at a regional or local level. Oncologists are not the only specialists worried by this reform. The Mental Health Foundation, a charity dedicated to the promotion of good mental health, has commented that the uncertainty around the roles of the National Institute for Health Protection threatens the good progress made in recent years. Cancer Research UK goes further, stating the decision to restructure public health services should be an opportunity to strengthen services, rather than deprioritising and underinvesting in public health. Matt Hancock's decision on PHE, and the absence of specific detail on its replacement organisation, coupled with our November editorial critiquing his handling of cancer services during the pandemic, further underscores grave concerns about his competency as the UK's Health Secretary.Pandemics, recessions, and public health are inextricably linked. The coming decade will be challenging—decisions already made to cope with the unprecedented events of 2020 will have long-term consequences, both economically and societally. Excess cancer deaths are unavoidable, but governments need to be more innovative in their solutions to strengthen public health, prevention, and access to the best treatments, irrespective of economic and political pressures that could force decisions in destructive directions that undermine the fundamental requirements of a healthy nation. It is the compassion of decisions made now that will determine the outcome of the years ahead.
Tuberculosis and malaria in the age of COVID-19/-/With the world still focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and hopes for vaccine rollout, the 2020 WHO global reports on tuberculosis and malaria are timely reminders that these diseases remain two of the three deadliest infectious diseases. A key question in early 2020 was how the added strains of the pandemic on health-care systems would impact their management, with some dire early conjectures. So where are we now?Tuberculosis elimination is on the right track, but progress is slower than necessary to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals target of reducing incidence by 80% and mortality by 90% from 2015 levels. By 2020, incidence has fallen by 9% (target 20%) and mortality by 14% (target 25%). About 3% of 2019 cases and 18% of previous cases were at least rifampicin-resistant. There is still huge between-region variability, with the low-burden European Region already at the SDG milestones, and the high-burden African Region progressing well. However, the three highest-burden countries (India, Indonesia, and China) are lagging, stressing the need for further investment in testing, treatment, prevention, and research capacities.For malaria, there has also been considerable progress since 2000 towards the WHO Global Technical Strategy targets (a reduction of incidence and mortality by 90% over 2015–30 and by 40% by 2020), but improvements have stalled in the past 5 years. There were 409 000 deaths globally in 2019, a 10% decrease from 2015 (this decrease was 24% in 2010–15). WHO estimates that the world is off track to meet the 2030 goals by 37% for incidence and by 22% for mortality, with trajectories representing a near levelling-off of any progress for the next decade. In 2019, 384 000 people died and 215 million became infected in Africa, accounting for 94% of malaria cases globally. Southeast Asia represents only about 3% of the global malaria burden, but the biggest contributors in the region are again India and Indonesia. Such countries doubly burdened by tuberculosis and malaria have also been hard-hit by COVID-19.By June 2020, tuberculosis screening and notifications of new diagnoses had declined sharply because of repurposing of diagnostic machines, health workers and facilities, and budgets, and lapses in data reporting. Disruptions of a similar nature have affected malaria-endemic countries, particularly delayed deliveries of bed-nets and chemoprophylaxis before seasonal peaks (affecting prevention) and stay-at-home orders for people with fever (affecting diagnosis and treatment access). The malaria report does not account for the impact of COVID-19, but an Article in this journal projects up to 261·6 million cases and 768 600 deaths in 2020 in Africa alone. This is a worst-case scenario that assumes simultaneous disruption of prevention services by up to 75%, a complete reversal of any post-2000 success. For tuberculosis, WHO estimates that if global notifications decrease by 25–50% for 3 months as a result of COVID-19, there could be up to 400 000 excess deaths in 2020, equivalent to the annual mortality for 2012.An Article in The Lancet Global Health modelled four COVID-19 pandemic management strategies assuming a basic reproductive number (R0) of 3·0 and the resultant tuberculosis and malaria incidence and mortality. At worst, there could be a 20% increase in excess deaths from tuberculosis and 36% from malaria by 2025. For malaria, incidence and deaths would be most affected in the short term by delays in prevention measures that coincide with seasonal peaks in transmission, but this could revert quickly with a return to pre-pandemic schedules. For tuberculosis, the world has broadly followed scenarios that the model found to be less damaging—mitigation of COVID-19 spread interspersed with stringent lockdowns. These approaches seem to better shrink the pandemic with less disruption of care-seeking and health services for non-COVID-19 diseases than no mitigation or prolonged lockdowns. Moreover, the study assumed a reproductive number that was probably an overestimate, with the global R0 having been mostly in the 1–2·5 range since March, according to data from Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.From experience so far, perhaps the worst predictions have not materialised. Still, diseases do not exist in isolation and one COVID-19 management scenario might work for tuberculosis, but exacerbate malaria burden, creating the need for exceedingly complex policy decisions. The bottom line is that while health-care workers in endemic countries have battled exceptionally hard on three fronts, policy makers cannot forget that tuberculosis and malaria are greater long-term threats than COVID-19, and planning of resource allocation must account for that.
A Pandemic Era/-/A little over a year ago the word pandemic was, for most people, associated with disaster movies and history books. Despite repeated warnings about the very real risk of occurrence from infectious disease experts, it felt remote and distant, not something for most people to worry about day to day. Needless to say, that experience has now been transformed almost everywhere. As we move into 2021 and vaccine roll out scales up, many will be hoping that we can put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. However, even if we manage a speedy recovery, we need to know if COVID was an unavoidable low probability risk—a once in a century event—or if it is an expression of an underlying trend that requires more self-reflection and capacity for change.In late July, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) held a transdisciplinary expert panel workshop to undertake a rapid assessment of the scientific evidence on the origin, emergence, and impact of COVID-19, as well as potential control and prevention options. That work programme culminated in a report published in late October, the findings of which were clear and concerning.Firstly, pandemic frequency was found to be on the rise, driven by increasing incidence of emerging disease events, with more than five new diseases emerging in people every year, each with potential to grow to pandemic proportions. Most of these emerging diseases and practically all pandemics including influenza, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19, are caused by microbes in animals which “spill over” after repeated contact between wildlife, livestock, and people. Combined with highly interconnected globalised economies and rapid transport, this makes pandemics a rapidly growing risk.Not only is pandemic risk on the rise, but COVID-19 has taught us that our societies are highly vulnerable. The cost in lives and livelihoods and wider economic damages have been astronomical (economic costs are estimated to be many trillions of USD). It is therefore clear that current reactive strategies which centre on rapid containment and control following disease emergence are insufficient to fight future pandemics. Rather we need to tackle the drivers of disease spill over. The evidence on this too is clear. Increasing disease emergence results from ecological disruption particularly land-use change, often related to agricultural expansion and intensification, as well as wildlife trade and consumption. Climate change and shifting species distributions pose an additional risk. As the report summarises “Without preventative strategies, pandemics will emerge more often, spread more rapidly, kill more people, and affect the global economy with more devastating impact than ever before.”Fortunately, the report doesn't stop there and goes on to lay out a series of evidence-based policy options to inform pandemic prevention strategies. They fall broadly under five categories, Enabling mechanisms, including launching a high-level intergovernmental council on pandemic prevention, policies to address the role of land-use change, policies related to wildlife trade, closing critical knowledge gaps, and fostering society-wide engagement in pandemic risk reduction.The report is clear that what is required is not a simple series of technical fixes. Escaping the “Pandemic Era” will require transformative changes and no less than a fundamental reassessment of our relationship with nature. In particular we must curb unsustainable consumption which underlies global environmental changes that in turn drives biodiversity loss, climate change, and pandemic emergence.The authors note that many of the proposals may seem costly, difficult and containing significant uncertainty. However, that perspective only holds by comparison to a fanciful counterfactual case in which pandemic risk and associated costs are not rising. The social and economic cost of COVID-19 has revealed that prevention strategies are potentially very cost effective by comparison to coping with a pandemic. The changes needed, while large, are aligned with wider requirements to benefit health, inequality and the Sustainable Development Goals more broadly.If most people were under the impression that ecological disruption was regrettable but didn't affect them directly, then 2020 must surely have been a wake-up call. COVID-19 wasn't just a rare event, but a symptom of ecological disruption. With pandemic disease, wildfire, extreme heat, intensified storms, and floods, 2020 has not been short of evidence of the need to rebalance our relationship with nature.
Artificial intelligence for COVID-19: saviour or saboteur?/-/As 2020 draws to a close, one thing is certain: the COVID-19 pandemic has had an irreversible effect on the world. The effect on digital health is no exception. The pandemic has forced health-care providers and governments around the world to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and scale up their use in medicine, even before they are proven to work. An untested AI algorithm has even received emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration. But will the use of untested AI systems help or hinder patients with COVID-19?The lax regulatory landscape for COVID-19 AI algorithms has raised substantial concern among medical researchers. A living systematic review published in the BMJ highlights that COVID-19 AI models are poorly reported and trained on small or low quality datasets with high risk of bias. Gary Collins, Professor of Medical Statistics at the University of Oxford and co-author of the BMJ review told The Lancet Digital Health, “full and transparent reporting of all key details of the development and evaluation of prediction models for COVID-19 is vital. Failure to report important details not only contributes to research waste, but more importantly can lead to a poorly developed and evaluated model being used that could cause more harm than benefit in clinical decision making.”To support transparent and reproducible reporting, source code and deidentified patient datasets for COVID-19 AI algorithms should be open and accessible to the research community. One such study, published in The Lancet Digital Health, reports a new AI COVID-19 screening test, named CURIAL AI, which uses routinely collected clinical data for patients presenting to hospital. In the hope that AI can help keep patients and health-care workers safe, Andrew Soltan and colleagues state that the AI test could allow exclusion of patients who do not have COVID-19 and ensure that patients with COVID-19 receive treatments rapidly. This is one of the largest AI studies to date with clinical data from more than a hundred thousand cases in the UK. Prospective validation of the AI screening test showed accurate and faster results compared with gold standard PCR tests.However, like other COVID-19 AI models, CURIAL AI requires validation across geographically and ethnically diverse populations to assess its real-world performance. Soltan emphasised that “We also do not yet know if the AI model would generalise to patient cohorts in different countries, where patients may come to hospital with a different spectrum of medical problems.”Even if preliminary models, like CURIAL AI, are proven to accurately diagnose disease in a wide range of populations, do they add clinical value to health-care systems? Last month, X, the Alphabet subsidiary announced that although they were able to develop an AI to identify features of electroencephalography data that might be useful for diagnosing depression and anxiety they found that experts were not convinced of the clinical value of the diagnostic aid. How AI tools for diagnosing health conditions can improve medical care is not always well understood by those developing the AI. Therefore, COVID-19 AI models must be developed in close collaboration with health-care workers, to understand how output of these models could be applied in patient care.As we enter flu season, AI tools, like CURIAL AI, face an increasingly challenging task to help clinicians differentiate between two respiratory infections with similar symptoms. If AI tools cannot be proven to discern one pneumonia from another, premature use of these technologies could increase misdiagnosis and sabotage clinical care for patients. Mistakes like this, if allowed to scale, will slow future use of potentially life-saving technologies and compromise clinician and patient trust in AI. To assess true accuracy of AI tools for COVID-19, clinical trials are essential to establish how AI can support COVID-19 patients in the real world.Soltan and colleagues are now planning clinical trials for deploying CURIAL AI within the existing clinical pathways at hospitals in the UK. The Lancet Digital Health strongly encourages researchers doing AI intervention-based clinical trials to follow the new extension guidelines SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI. In our previous Editorial, we described the importance of these guidelines to support accurate and transparent evaluation of AI.AI could be the saviour of the COVID-19 pandemic in the coming year; we just need to prove it.
COVID-19 vaccines: the pandemic will not end overnight/-/“This is the weapon that is going to win the war”, declared New York Governor Andrew Cuomo about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), as its tentative rollout begins in the UK, the USA, and Canada. A great achievement for sure, but this first step in what will need to be a global mass immunisation programme will not immediately end the COVID-19 pandemic. Although control over the infection's most harmful effects is expected and limiting its spread can be hoped for, it will likely be a few years before the virus can be brought under control worldwide.Ideally, multiple vaccines will be approved in most countries and we will have a detailed understanding of their efficacy, the duration of the immunity they induce, and their effect on viral transmission. At the time of writing, there have been efficacy reports from phase 3 trials of five vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [University of Oxford and AstraZeneca], Sputnik V [Gamaleya Research Institute], and BBIBP-CorV [Sinopharm]), but the data to support these reports have only been published in peer-reviewed journals for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and only the former has been evaluated by drug regulatory authorities and approved for emergency or limited use in some countries. Despite the lack of official assessments, Russia has started distributing Sputnik V and the United Arab Emirates and Barhain have fully approved BBIBP-CorV, already widely distributed in China, despite uncertainties surrounding its efficacy and safety.Even for the vaccines for which data are publicly available, many unknowns with a bearing on the effectiveness of immunisation programmes remain. How long does immunity last? By necessity, trials have collected data for just a few months, but only long-term, post-immunisation monitoring will clarify whether the initial vaccine doses are sufficient or further boosts are needed. Do any of the vaccines prevent viral transmission? Such data are only available from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine trial, but it was underpowered to generate firm conclusions. Still, data from participants who received a first half dose and a second full booster dose indicate fewer asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections than in the control group, suggesting reduced transmission. Are the vaccines safe and efficacious in populations that have not been included in trials and might be at increased risk of severe disesase, such as pregnant women? Only their inclusion in trials will answer this question. But in the meantime, should they be vaccinated (by weighing the risks of possible adverse reactions) or protected through shielding or herd immunity? The unknowns of how the vaccine affects transmission makes the possibility of achieving herd immunity through vaccination uncertain.In addition to these unknowns, the world has never before needed to implement mass immunisation of its entire adult population. The challenges it entails range from financial, to logistic, to social and will affect how quickly and successfully the countries that have already started distributing a vaccine—all upper-middle-income or high-income countries—will be able to start controlling the disease. However, these countries should remember that the pandemic will really only be over when it is under control globally. International initiatives, most notably the COVAX Facility, are in place to support low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in establishing vaccination programmes and ensuring equitable access to vaccine doses. However, by Dec 16, 2020, COVAX had only secured about 400 million of the 2 billion doses needed to guarantee that 20% of the population of participating LMICs has access to a vaccine in 2021, while the EU, the UK, the USA, and Canada have already made deals with manufacturers to buy more than 50% of the doses expected to be available in 2021, despite these countries representing only 14% of the global population. AstraZeneca is the only manufacturer of those whose efficacy reports have been confirmed that has pledged to sell vaccine doses to LMICs at cost. There is hope that if the efficacies of Sputnik V and BBIBP-CorV are confirmed and these vaccines are approved, they will provide a new pool of doses for LMICs.Vaccines will be instrumental in the control of COVID-19, but their global distribution will be challenging and their effect won't be immediate. As cases and deaths continue to rise across the world, the non-pharmaceutical interventions to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that the global population has by now become accustomed to will need to remain in place for a while longer.
Facing up to long COVID/-/Multiorgan symptoms after COVID-19 are being reported by increasing numbers of patients. They range from cough and shortness of breath, to fatigue, headache, palpitations, chest pain, joint pain, physical limitations, depression, and insomnia, and affect people of varying ages. At the Lancet–Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences conference on Nov 23, Bin Cao presented data (in press at The Lancet) on the long-term consequences of COVID-19 for patients in Wuhan, and warned that dysfunctions and complications could persist in some discharged patients for at least 6 months. So-called long COVID is a burgeoning health concern and action is needed now to address it.The occurrence of multiorgan complications is not unexpected, given that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple tissues. Globally, there is a growing response to long COVID. On Dec 3–4, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held the federal government's first workshop on long COVID. In the UK, the NHS announced the launch of 40 long COVID clinics to tackle persistent symptoms and NICE will release its first clinical guidelines shortly. WHO is planning to update its guidance and resources for clinical management of COVID-19 to include long COVID.Nevertheless, there is much that remains unknown, and the response to long COVID is still in its infancy. What are the diagnoses, definitions, and phenotypes of illness that are grouped under the term long COVID? How long does it last? Who is at risk of serious or prolonged sequelae? What are the underlying causes and mechanisms? How do we prevent or reduce the effects of such sequelae on patient health and wellbeing? Are there any effective treatments to aid patient recovery and the regain of full function? What rehabilitation is needed?Robust data and scientific evidence are essential to answer these questions. Large and long-term cohort studies are urgently needed to help better understand the trajectory, complications, and biological mechanisms that drive the long-term health consequences of COVID-19. These studies should include diverse populations, with both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients, patients from primary and secondary care, and patients from a range of high-income, low-income, and middle-income countries. Minority ethnic groups and older people have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, so ethnic and demographic factors must also be considered during patient recruitment. Patient perspectives regarding terminology of symptoms and recovery should be incorporated into study designs to ensure clinically meaningful research questions and outcomes. Multidisciplinary, multicentre, and multinational collaborations and approaches to data collection are required. Digital services and systems should be able to collect data on symptoms in real time.Meanwhile, how do we address long COVID? First, health professionals must listen to patients to understand their concerns, validate their experiences, and manage their symptoms and comorbidities, referring patients as needed. Many patients already feel dismissed or overlooked. Without clear clinical definitions of long COVID, and in the absence of either a diagnostic test or an effective treatment, health professionals are in a difficult position to help their patients. The slowly evolving knowledge of other poorly understood conditions (such as chronic pain and functional disorders) shows the risks for patients who feel that their symptoms are being diminished or ignored. Without clear acknowledgment, honest communication, and careful patient-centred research, patients face unsatisfactory outcomes. Such mistakes must not be repeated for long COVID.Second, discharged patients should have long-term access to multidisciplinary health care, including rehabilitation services and telehealth, as well as social and financial support. Third, long COVID affects even young adults, so effective public health messaging for such individuals about the risks of infection is warranted. Fourth, primary care services need the capacity to deal with patients with long COVID. Finally, health-care workers themselves are likely to have a high burden of long COVID and they must have adequate occupational health provision.Although vaccination has become the immediate focus of the pandemic response for many countries, patients with long COVID must not be forgotten or sidelined as countries begin to consider the end of the pandemic. Acknowledging the potential scale of the problem now and the complexities and variabilities of the disease course, and pressing for better research and care, could avoid years of struggle and mismanagement for patients with long COVID.
An African plan to control COVID-19 is urgently needed/-/As governments in countries hit hardest by COVID-19 prepare vaccination programmes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), other nations face a more uncertain future. In Africa, for example, the pandemic continues to grow, but heterogeneously. Cases are rising sharply in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and South Africa. But in Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria, WHO reports only 1173 deaths from COVID-19. Although data are sparse, the first wave of the pandemic seemed to peak in early August. Numbers of COVID-19 deaths declined through September, but the disease has been stubbornly persistent since then, burning slowly through communities throughout the continent. As of Dec 1, WHO reports 1·5 million cases and 33 573 deaths from COVID-19.Despite the diversity of the pandemic in Africa, and the fact that many countries appear to have been spared the human calamity that has afflicted so many nations elsewhere, the continent still needs a vaccination plan. COVID-19 is a global health emergency that demands a global solution. No community is safe from SARS-CoV-2 unless all communities are protected. Further national lockdowns to drive down the prevalence of the virus will not provide a permanent answer to the epidemic threat. With tens of millions of Africans plunged into extreme poverty by COVID-19, further mandates to shut down economies will precipitate humanitarian and health crises.COVAX, the Gavi-led financing mechanism to provide COVID-19 vaccines to low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), plans to have 2 billion doses of vaccine available by the end of 2021. 97 high-income countries have now signed up to the initiative and 92 LMICs—including most African countries—will be supported by the plan. COVAX aims to secure enough doses of any vaccine to provide protection to an initial 20% of people in signatory countries. That level of coverage may help with the immediate aim of protecting the most at risk, but it is insufficient to achieve herd immunity. For a virus whose R0 is 2·5, around 60% of the population would need to be vaccinated to extinguish community transmission. And that figure assumes a perfect vaccine. For a vaccine with an efficacy of 90%, the proportion of the population to be vaccinated rises to 67%. If a vaccine with an even lower efficacy is used, the proportion will rise still further. The University of Oxford–AstraZeneca partnership has pledged to supply COVAX with “hundreds of millions of doses” of their vaccine, which—importantly for African countries—needs only the standard 2–8°C cold chain.In July, the African Union Commission and the African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention launched a safety-net strategy to secure access to vaccines and treatments for countries on the continent. The Consortium for COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trials (CONCVACT) has already set up several Africa-based clinical trials of vaccines and scaled up production of both testing and diagnostic facilities. CONCVACT has orchestrated pan-African cooperation, set up information-sharing platforms, and led the creation of technical capacity for screening and surveillance.Despite these advances, the vaccination of two-thirds of Africa's 1·2 billion population will still require huge investment and faces substantial logistical challenges. According to a WHO analysis, the African region has an average score of 33% readiness for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine roll-out—far below the necessary 80% benchmark. The estimated cost of delivering a vaccine to priority populations alone is estimated to be around US$5·7 billion—and this figure does not include the additional cost of injection materials and other consumables.Further concerns include transparency and patent protection. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) points out that the six front-running COVID-19 vaccine candidates have had $12 billion of taxpayer's money invested in their development. Yet vaccine deals with countries are often “shrouded in secrecy”, MSF argues. There have also been calls to waive intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines. India and South Africa first made the request in October. A waiver would help ensure more equitable access to a vaccine and could be a turning point in the pandemic for nations with few resources.Whether existing initiatives will translate into an effective and universal COVID-19 vaccination programme for Africa remains to be seen. But as the governments of wealthy countries push their way to the front of the vaccine queue, their leaders would do well to remember that without a vaccine plan for African countries and other nations with resource constraints, the protection of their citizens from COVID-19 will be an illusory victory.
Coronavirus vaccine? Join the queue/-/News that several COVID-19 vaccine candidates seem to be at least 90% efficacious were received with much enthusiasm and an unquestionable sense of relief. But other challenges lie ahead, including coping with a demand that will far exceed their initial supply. As a result, nations and expert organisations must select which groups will first be immunised. Age-tiered approaches that also prioritise health and social care workers will reduce mortality and alleviate the pressure on health systems, but other vulnerable groups must not be forgotten. Current evidence suggests that adults of any age with certain underlying health conditions (including diabetes) are at increased risk for severe COVID-19. According to a revised ranking issued in November, 2020, in the UK, all adults deemed clinically extremely vulnerable (eg, those with specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions, and recipients of solid organ transplants) were placed in the same priority group as people aged 70–74 years. All high-risk adults younger than 65 years (including those with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and severe obesity [BMI ≥40 kg/m2]) were placed in the priority queue ahead of people aged 60–64 years.Vaccination priority lists are not universally agreed and may or may not be subject to public consultation in different jurisdictions. Nations will face different challenges in vaccine allocation depending on various economic, political, social, and epidemiological factors. And vaccine planning will change with enhanced knowledge of both virus and vaccines. For example, data on seroconversion and seroprotection for patients with comorbidities are currently scarce since in many phase 1/2 trials those groups were excluded due to safety considerations. For the vaccine candidates with efficacy data announced so far, no data for patients with chronic health conditions have been disclosed at the time of writing.Although there are excellent reasons to be optimistic about the new COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is essential that comorbidity data be disclosed as soon as available and used to inform vaccine planning. We owe those most clinically vulnerable in our communities nothing less.
COVID-19 reinfection: are we ready for winter?/-/Since the beginning of this pandemic, an ongoing concern is whether one person can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) more than once. Occasional reports of people retesting positive, after seemingly clearing the virus, have been published. In a retrospective article published in EBioMedicine in September, Jing Lu and colleagues (Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Guangdong CDC, China), reported that 87 (14%) of the 619 patients who had recovered from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection retested positive by real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). All patients who tested positive a second time in the study presented with mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and the researchers were unable to isolate the infectious virus by culture or detect sequencing of full-length viral genomes at the time of the second positive test. Because all patients who tested positive a second time were socially isolated during the study, the recurrence of test positivity might have resulted from ongoing shedding of viral fragments from the original infection.Indeed, a patient who retests positive for virus might not necessarily be experiencing a second, new SARS-CoV-2 infection. To confirm reinfection with a distinct virus as opposed to prolonged viral shedding, whole viral genome sequencing from each, potentially separate, infection is necessary. Based on this standard, true reinfection cases have now been documented in Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Ecuador. In October, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Richard Tillett and colleagues (University of Nevada, NV, USA) reported the first case of reinfection in the USA. Despite the fact that isolates from both the first infection (A) and second infection (B) belonged to Clade 20C, specimen A had four single nucleotide variants (SNVs) not seen in specimen B, while specimen B had seven distinct SNVs compared with specimen A. Considering these substantial genetic differences, the authors excluded the possibility of viral evolution within the infected individual. Unlike cases in Hong Kong and the Netherlands and Belgium, the patients in Ecuador and the USA had more severe symptoms upon secondary infection. The reasons for increased severity in these two cases are as yet unknown.Secondary infection could result from an inadequate immune stimulation upon the first encounter with the virus, or the decline of the neutralizing antibody responses over time. In fact, the robustness and longevity of neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been comprehensively defined. In the June 2020 issue of Nature Medicine, Quanxin Long and colleagues (Chongqing Medical University, China) found that, compared with the symptomatic group, patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic had significantly lower IgG levels in the acute phase and early convalescent phase. Moreover, 40% of patients who were asymptomatic became seronegative for IgG 8 weeks after being discharged from the hospital, compared with 12•9% who were seronegative for the symptomatic group. An insufficient immune response could be a partial reason for the reinfection case in Hong Kong, as Paul Chan and colleagues (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China) reported in Emerging Infectious Diseases (December 2020, first online now) that the patient had low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody against multiple viral proteins during the primary mild-symptomatic infection and acute stage of asymptomatic reinfection.Encouragingly, however, in a larger analysis published in Science in October, Ania Wajnberg and colleagues (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, USA), found that over 90% of infected individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms had moderate-to-high titers of antibodies against spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and these titers remain relatively stable for at least a period of around 5 months. Thus, much larger, definitive, serology studies are needed across a variety of populations and disease severities to get a comprehensive look at the degrees to which durable humoral immunity is induced by this virus.In addition to variable immune stimulation, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 might also have a potential role in reinfection. In a Cell paper published in September, Qianqian Li and colleagues (National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China) systematically analyzed 80 natural variants in the S-protein for their infectivity and sensitivity to neutralization by antibody or convalescent serum samples using in vitro assays. Fortunately, the strain with the D614G mutation in the viral S-protein, a major variant now circulating globally, seems to retain susceptibility to neutralization by both convalescent serum samples and a panel of tested S-protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. This result was further supported by a medRxiv preprint done in September by Drew Weissman and colleagues (University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA). Although not formally peer reviewed, this group reported data using pseudoviruses bearing either the D614 or G614 S-protein that the D614G spike mutation could increase susceptibility of the viral S-protein to antibody neutralization. That said, Qianqian Li and colleagues found that particular S-protein variants, including A475V, L452R, V483A, and F490L, were less susceptible to neutralization by a subset of antibodies tested. Although the frequencies of such variants are still very low in the population, caution is warranted, as some leading vaccine candidates are using the S-protein as the immunogen.In addition to humoral immunity, T cells also have a crucial role in clearing viruses from the body. In a July issue of Nature, Nina Le Bert and colleagues (Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore) reported that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from individuals who recovered from mild-to-severe COVID-19 could recognize multiple regions of the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, they found that patients who recovered from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago, which was caused by SARS-CoV, possess memory T cells that have robust cross-reactivity to the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, stimulating T-cell responses could be an important consideration in vaccine development for a long-lasting protective effect.With only four documented cases formally reported to date, is reinfection likely to be a rare phenomenon? Considering the relatively high percentage of asymptomatic infections (up to 40% as estimated by the USA CDC), it is possible that many undocumented reinfections have occurred. However, without viral genome sequencing data, the true reinfection rate cannot be confirmed. 12 months have passed since SARS-CoV-2 was first reported, but there is still so much to learn. Until effective methods of curing and preventing COVID-19 have been found, maintaining social distance and wearing masks are still our best options for personal protection, especially with the coming winter.
2020: A year of change/-/More than 60 million SARS-COV-2-positive people and more than 1·5 million deaths later, 2020 has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While social distancing, sickness, and disruption to normal life have affected the work of millions globally, there has been a number of positive events and discoveries made over the year. As we move toward the end of the year, we highlight some of the most important events of 2020.At the turn of the year news of a wild measles outbreak in a number of south Pacific islands the most prominent of which was Samoa. By Jan 22nd, 2020, 5707 measles cases and 83 measles-related deaths had been recorded in the region. The outbreaks were directly related to a decline in levels of vaccination between 2013 and 2018 from an estimated 99% of children younger than 1 year to 40% in 2018 in Samoa. Control of the outbreak was directly addressed via a number of mandatory vaccination programmes across Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji, assisted by an international coalition of nations and organisations including New Zealand, Australia, the UK, French Polynesia, Israel, Hawaii, and UNICEF. The last case of measles in Samoa was reported at the end of January demonstrating the power a strong international collaborative response can have in the control of a lethal viral epidemic.In March, EClinicalMedicine launched a collection of articles highlighting gender disparities and inequality across the world. Following on from The Lancet’s theme issue on women in science, medicine, and global health in 2019, this collection took up the commitment to fighting for true parity in gender across the medical and health-care landscapes. The journal continues to be a home to studies and pieces that challenge the entrenched thinking of the health-care landscape.Inequity and inequality continued to be the theme over the following months, as the murders of Breonna Taylor in March and George Floyd in May brought into focus the continued mistreatment of Black lives across society. The Black Lives Matter movement has been involved in drawing attention to numerous killings and racially motivated violence against Black people since 2013, after the murder of Trayvon Martin. However, the succession of graphic deaths disseminated via social media led to a net-positive response to the movement's advocacy for the importance of Black life and encouraged self-reflection and acknowledgment of the role in racial discrimination across a society. In health care, the self-reflection has triggered researchers to investigate and detail the for too long undiscussed inequities faced by ethnic minorities in health-care systems. These inequalities have been further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the disproportionate burden on ethnic minorities. The Lancet group published a pledge to improve representation and to eliminate systemic racism in health and research from its internal Group for Racial Equality in October. EClinicalMedicine aims to play a central role in this commitment by the curation of a collection of articles highlighting ethnic and racial inequity and inequality in healthcare and health-care systems and a call for action and change in 2021.In August WHO certified the Africa region as free from polio. This certification indicates a 4-year period of polio-free positive cases in the region. The last incidences were reported in Nigeria, which accounted for nearly half of all cases in the continent, in 2010. This eradication milestone represents an enormous vaccination effort across the continent and brings us closer to a polio-free planet.2020 also revealed progress in the challenges of early testing for neurodegenerative disorders. In October, EClinicalMedicine published a study by Elif Eyigoz and colleagues at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center which used artificial intelligence to predict Alzheimer's and cognitive decline using linguistic performance in a standardised task. In November, the above was followed up by the announcement of a blood test available clinically to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the USA.2020 was also the year of the US Presidential election, held in November. As the USA saw the most positive cases and fatalities, much of the election discussion focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic had been handled and future directions. On the eve of the election, EClinicalMedicine published an Editorial putting into focus failures in handling the pandemic and calling for a return to science-based decision making. The results of the election and subsequent new health-care appointments suggest a positive change in direction of the US handling of the COVID-19 pandemic moving forward.November saw Scotland become the first country in the world to provide free and universal access to period products. Recent UK research suggests 15% of girls have struggled to afford sanitary wear, while 14% have had to ask to borrow sanitary wear from a friend due to affordability issues. This simple piece of legislation directly addressed the gender inequity of Period Poverty.The COVID-19 pandemic galvanised the infectious disease research community to first isolate and identify the virus and at rapid pace construct, test, trial, and manufacture a number of viable vaccines. The unprecedented speed and efficiency shown by research groups and organisations across the globe to develop a vaccine is an incredible example of collaborative science at work. The efforts of these groups on Dec 8, saw Maggie Keenan, a grandmother aged 91 years, receive the first non-trial vaccination as part of the UK's vaccination programme.
“The beginning is the most important part of the work”/-/In our very first Editorial, we outlined several aspirations, the first of which was to set ourselves apart from other journals in the clinical microbiology sphere by catering to work that furthered the understanding of microbes and other pathogens at all scales. The idea was to publish studies that contribute to health through a direct understanding of the pathogen and how the pathogen affects the host at a physiological level, but also how the pathogen impacts populations. And from these insights gain a clearer understanding of the role the pathogen plays in disease, of which it is only one factor. In our short 8-month existence we have published 25 research articles that show our commitment to this fresh perspective of what a clinical microbiology journal should represent. Our articles have spanned analyses of pathogens from the molecular to the epidemiological level.But beyond this stated aim, we made it clear that first and foremost we are enthusiasts: “we are motivated by a complete fascination regarding pathogens and will consider any research that adds to the understanding of pathogenic microorganisms or other transmissible agents”. Despite the clear current importance of research into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19, we have not been distracted from the broader microbial world and we have also published research into antimicrobial resistance, cholera, gonorrhoea, hepatitis C virus, HIV, influenza, malaria, meningococcus, mycobacteria, rhinovirus, and yaws. The topic touched on by the largest number of our articles (11) was antimicrobial resistance; crucially, this work was not limited to bacteria as it included research looking at resistance to antimalarial and HIV drugs. The existential threat posed by antimicrobial resistance means it will always feature heavily among our content. Inevitably, this topic was followed closely by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.So far, we have published eight research articles exploring a spectrum of properties of SARS-CoV-2 from its behaviour at the cellular level, to transmission in different species, to human seroprevalence studies. Also, among these studies, we published an assessment of an innovative lab-free PCR-based test. Going forward, we stand by the commitment we made in our first Editorial: we will continue to be a venue for this work even when it is no longer newsworthy. Our interest here is to offer a platform for research that fully uncovers the nature of the virus, beyond what is needed to tackle the current crisis. That same commitment applies to other pathogens: we will strive to present work that provides a deep-seated understanding of pathogens and their health-related impacts.It was never our intention to launch a journal focused on pathogens during the most impactful global pandemic of recent times, and it has undeniably been a challenge to navigate the choppy waters of science done with such a huge sense of urgency. However, we have carefully curated a collection of articles that offer an insight into the finer aspects of SARS-CoV-2. Our very first article on the topic, assessed the tropism of the virus against a range of cell types, providing early hints into the characteristics of the virus and how these might affect patients. We added to these insights with a study exploring transmission between various animals, which became all the more relevant with the news of SARS-CoV-2 in mink. More recently, we published autopsy studies, which built on the initial inferences about the pathology of the disease, and a meta-analysis drawing together the research so far on viral shedding and infectiousness.We have lived up to our promise to see clinical microbiology through a new lens. This is still just the beginning of our journey, but as Plato taught “the beginning is the most important part of the work”. It is unclear what will become of the current pandemic, but we can be certain that more major outbreaks lie ahead. They will yield further waves of research output seeking the right platform, but, as we concluded in our first Editorial, we will be here to support those efforts. Although we have started strongly, we have every intention to keep advancing. This strong start would not have been possible without the contributions of authors and reviewers, for which we are very grateful. During 2021, we will begin publishing Personal View and Review papers to broaden the service we provide to both authors and readers. Our ambition is that, as an open access journal, we can be a conduit between researchers and the broadest possible audience.
Maintaining the HIV response in a world shaped by COVID-19/-/Although global attention is dominated by COVID-19, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as it enters its fifth decade, is far from over. Since the early 1980s, 75·7 million people have become infected with HIV. 32·7 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses. HIV/AIDS remains a major public health crisis and only a few countries will meet the 90–90–90 treatment target for 2020. Much has been made of how information systems and service models in the HIV response have helped the COVID-19 response, but the COVID-19 pandemic could have knock-on effects on the HIV response and be devastating for communities. How might the COVID-19 pandemic shape the future HIV/AIDS response towards reaching the goal of ending HIV/AIDS by 2030?The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health systems and exposed gaps in public health almost everywhere. From the highest levels of national leadership to community-based health facilities, human, financial, and research resources have been diverted from HIV efforts. Most health systems in regions with a high HIV burden are fragile and several studies suggest that disruptions to HIV services could have negative effects on health outcomes in the medium and long term. Modelling data published in The Lancet Global Health show that severe treatment disruptions in high-burden settings could increase HIV mortality by 10% within 5 years. The HIV Modelling Consortium has shown that severe treatment disruptions in sub-Saharan Africa—eg, preventing HIV treatment for 50% of patients for 6 months—could lead to an excess of 296 000 HIV deaths within a year. UNAIDS models suggest that 6-month interruptions to services for mother-to-child transmission of HIV could increase new infections among children by 40–80% in high-burden countries.While in many countries, HIV prevention, testing, and care have been disrupted because of strict lockdown policies and breaks in medicine supply chains, UNAIDS says the effects of COVID-19 on maintaining treatment services have so far been less severe than originally feared. Thanks to novel approaches, such as home deliveries of medicines and digital platforms for virtual patient support, HIV prevention services have rebounded in many communities.A chilling pattern of inequity shapes the burden of COVID-19 and HIV. The adverse effects of each disease are exacerbated by social and economic disparities and disproportionately affect poor and marginalised people—young women and girls in particular. The socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be far reaching and long lasting. The World Bank warns that 115 million people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020. COVID-19 is also poised to increase inequity as pandemic-related job losses and deprivation affect poor and vulnerable people most acutely. Poverty could result in further barriers to engaging with the HIV care system.Dec 1, 2020, is World AIDS Day. Against the backdrop of an extraordinary health crisis, this year's campaign calls for global solidarity and joint responsibility. To health leaders facing many competing priorities, what might this entail in practice? In 2018, the International AIDS Society-Lancet Commission envisioned a new era of global solidarity, in which the HIV response would integrate with the broader global health field. Built on the AIDS movement's commitment to human rights, gender equality, and health equity, this new era could focus on developing robust, flexible, people-centred health systems, achieving universal health coverage, and addressing the social and structural determinants of health. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria adopted a systems-strengthening approach in 2016. For other institutions that have been instrumental in the AIDS response, this outlook should mean that fragmented, siloed approaches are replaced with broader health system strengthening and preparedness that integrate HIV with other health priorities.The integration of HIV with COVID-19 is already happening. COVID-19 has compelled numerous countries to accelerate the scale-up of differentiated service delivery for HIV by expediting multi-month dispensing of HIV medicine, which they otherwise may not have done. COVID-19 is imperilling HIV services and forcing health systems to adapt. But adaptations need not always be harmful. Looking for opportunities to prioritise people-centred strategies could empower patients and help to address issues such as stigma, discrimination, and poverty, in addition to reducing contact with health facilities and so freeing up capacity. Such an approach is needed to rejuvenate the HIV response and get ending the HIV pandemic back on track.
COVID-19 vaccines: no time for complacency/-/“Yes. Yes. Yes.” That was the response of John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, when asked whether we could be confident that life will be returning to normal by spring. He was being interviewed by the BBC shortly after the announcement last week by Pfizer and BioNTech that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate had 90% efficacy in clinical trials. Similar announcements about the Russian Sputnik V and Moderna vaccines followed soon after. The prospect of preventing illness and death, and avoiding the harm and misery of extended restrictions, is a cause for optimism. But although it is right to be hopeful and encouraged, we are far from ending COVID-19 as a public health issue.Unfortunately, the trials' results were announced via press releases, leaving many scientific uncertainties that will dictate how the vaccines will affect the course of the pandemic. Little safety data are available. How well the vaccines work in older people or those with underlying conditions and their efficacy in preventing severe disease are still unclear. Peer-reviewed publication should resolve these issues, but other questions will not be answerable for some time. For one, the duration of protection is unknown and will have a huge bearing on the practicalities and logistics of immunisation (will boosters be needed? How often?).Whether the vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or mainly just protect against illness is largely unknown too. If the latter, achieving herd immunity through immunisation becomes a difficult prospect. Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccine for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021. As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunised any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. There is a danger that the public might become complacent following the news of promising vaccines, but how much more difficult will it be to ensure adherence to guidance and restrictions when a vaccine is available to many but others remain unprotected? Vaccine hesitancy is also a clear threat to COVID-19 control. New data show that willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine is far from universal. When even wearing a face mask can be painted as a political act rather than a public health measure, responsible leadership and careful public communications will be essential.These concerns will be irrelevant in places where a vaccine is unavailable entirely. Leaving aside the huge logistical challenges of manufacturing and roll-out (including onerous cold-chain requirements for some candidates), vaccine nationalism remains a major threat to equitable access. COVAX, the GAVI-led financing mechanism to provide COVID vaccines to low-income and middle-income countries, has raised US$2 billion, but needs $5 billion more for 2021. Pfizer and Moderna have not yet reached agreements with COVAX to supply vaccines; Pfizer has issued an expression of interest. By contrast, a handful of high-income countries have already secured the option to buy hundreds of millions of doses. Although some vaccine developers have promised to limit profits from the COVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer and Moderna have made no such commitments.What does the long-term future look like? Will SARS-CoV-2 become endemic, in a post-pandemic phase? It is likely, but it is too early to be sure what form this endemicity will take. Vaccines will be just one determinant. Reinfections are another: they appear rare so far, but the pandemic is still young. The nature and length of immune responses, and the characteristics of the virus and infection play a role too. Can infection provide sterilising immunity? How quickly does protective immunity wane? How severe might reinfection be? How does immunity vary by sex, ethnicity, and age? Will we have annual seasonal outbreaks? Or longer spells of quiescence punctuated by re-emergence? And how will health systems have to adapt accordingly? These issues and many others will determine the continuing impacts of COVID-19 on health and all are still poorly understood.2020 has been a year of incredible scientific achievement. In less than 12 months, researchers have characterised a novel illness, sequenced a new virus's genome, developed diagnostics, produced treatment protocols, and established the efficacy of drugs and vaccines in randomised controlled trials. Many people are feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time. But there is still much to learn and many barriers to overcome. On Nov 14, 5 days after the announcement by Pfizer, 663  772 new cases of COVID-19 were recorded, the largest number in a single day. It is a dangerous moment to be complacent.
COVID-19 in Latin America: a humanitarian crisis/-/Latin America has some of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world. Why? For outsiders, much of the discussion of COVID-19 in Latin America has focused on Brazil and the errors of President Jair Bolsonaro. But the region as a whole is facing a humanitarian crisis borne out of political instability, corruption, social unrest, fragile health systems, and perhaps most importantly, longstanding and pervasive inequality—in income, health care, and education—which has been woven into the social and economic fabric of the region.An estimated 231 million people in Latin America are predicted to be living in poverty by the end of 2020 (reaching a level last seen 15 years ago). Latin American countries have long had some of the most scarring income inequalities in the world, and they are predicted to worsen. The informal labour market is huge, making up 54% of all work across the region (up to 70% in some countries, such as Peru). Informal workers have little access to social protection and have no choice but to continue to work daily to earn a living. The result is that their capability to follow quarantine and social distancing measures is limited. Informal workers also have less access to health care.The overall population health status in Latin America and the Caribbean has improved, as measured by life expectancy, under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality, but progress remains unequal across and within countries. In Venezuela and Cuba, for example, population health has worsened, with disability-adjusted life-years increasing by more than 10% over the past decade. The syndemic nature of the pandemic—a combination of viral infection and non-communicable diseases embedded in social inequities—is acute in the region. The increases in obesity and diabetes in Latin America are surely major contributors to the high mortality rates. In Mexico and Chile, more than 75% of the female population is overweight. Nutrient-poor and energy-dense processed foods are often the only type of food readily affordable to the most disadvantaged people.Although some countries, including Brazil and Costa Rica, have a universal health-care system, most Latin American countries have large gaps in accessibility caused mainly by out-of-pocket health expenditure, which is 34% of total health spending. Political power is overly concentrated. There is corruption in the use of public resources. Often, the result is a strengthened private sector to the detriment of public health services. Without universal health coverage, tackling the pandemic will be impossible.Displacement of people has soared in central America, and the Venezuelan migrant crisis is impacting the region. Rising inequalities have driven domestic political tensions and social unrest in Colombia, Bolivia, and Chile. Gender inequalities are also important in Latin America's pandemic. 73% of those employed in the region's health sector are women, and gender-based violence is increasing.COVID-19 began as a health crisis but is now a humanitarian crisis. On Oct 28, 2020, at the 38th UN session of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, foreign ministers from 33 countries in the region signed a political declaration on a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery from COVID-19. The declaration recognises that inequalities remain pervasive, even in countries with high levels of economic growth. Further investment in social protection is needed to reduce inequalities and ensure that economic growth is sustained, inclusive, and equitable. While this declaration is promising, political will is notoriously difficult to translate into meaningful action. How can Latin America address these issues?A regional approach may help, but is under threat. While the Latin American Alliance for Global Health facilitates cooperation among academics in the region, national governments have left the PAHO at risk of insolvency through a lack of solidarity. It is imperative that Latin American countires work to strengthen PAHO. There is also a role for the global health community. Historically, middle income countries, including many in Latin America, have been overlooked in global health. There is an African CDC, but no Latin American CDC, for example. Many global health experts in Latin America feel that the region is too often neglected. To deal with the core drivers of the pandemic in the region, and perhaps to salvage some good from a disaster, global health initiatives need to take Latin America more seriously.
Growing up in the shadow of COVID-19/-/8 months into the pandemic, the UK Government's inadequate consideration of young people in the COVID-19 response is causing lasting harm to a whole generation. Although children and adolescents are generally less clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 than are adults, the wider effects of COVID-19 policies have disproportionately and negatively affected the young.Data emerging from multiple sources show that, during the first phase of the pandemic in March–June, closures of schools, nurseries, and outdoor play spaces, and reduced clinical and community services have endangered child health and widened pre-existing disparities. Early findings of a survey of 500 parents showed that young children (aged 0–3 years) from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to engage in enriching activities, had less access to outdoor space and books, and had more daily screen time than their wealthier peers. In some areas of England, more than half of health visitors who support new parents and infants have been redeployed to COVID-19 services, raising concerns about missed needs in young children's growth, development, and safeguarding. A quarter of pupils (roughly 2·5 million children in the UK) had no schooling or tutoring during lockdown; while 74% of those at private schools had full days of teaching, the proportion was only 38% for state school pupils. Cancelled exams and the heavily criticised grading system have left many students missing out on university places and facing an uncertain future. Young people are also more likely to work in sectors affected by COVID-19; in the Social Mobility Survey, 11% of those aged 16–25 years reported losing their jobs between February and September, compared with 5% of older adults, and nearly 60% of young people reported a fall in their earnings.These diminished educational and economic prospects compound the burden of the pandemic on young people's mental health and wellbeing. In July, 2020, the Mental Health and Young People Survey included 3570 participants aged 5–22 years and found that 16% had a probable mental disorder, a sizeable increase from 11% in 2017. One in ten young people aged 11–22 years said that they often or always felt lonely, and nearly 30% reported sleep problems in the past 7 days. A report by the Resolution Foundation showed that over 40% of young adults aged 18–29 years reported higher than normal levels of mental health problems in April, 2020, an 80% increase from 2017–19 levels and a much higher proportion than other adult age groups.Inadequate preparations in the summer—notably, the failure to implement an effective test–trace–isolate strategy and scarce support for early reopening of schools—once again left young people in a chaotic situation in September. After encouraging students to go back to university campuses, many were left to self-isolate in their halls of residence with limited support.As the UK faces a second wave, these mistakes must not be repeated. The needs of children and adolescents must no longer be sidelined in policy making. Child health and social services should remain accessible and adequately staffed, especially as the winter typically sees peak demand for paediatric acute and emergency care. Schools should remain open for as long as possible; in case of closures, additional support such as free school meals and access to laptops and internet connections must be given to vulnerable children to avoid widening disparities further. Catch-up tutoring and careful planning for exams in 2021 must be in place to give pupils a fair chance at this crucial life stage.The UK Government's disastrous handling of the pandemic has exacerbated the already precarious state of national child health resulting from a decade of austerity and cuts in funding for children's services. Before the pandemic, the 2020 State of Child Health report already highlighted increasing child poverty in working families, worsening mental health, and widening inequalities. With a whole generation caught in a limbo in 2020, the Government must immediately step up long-term investment in prevention and early intervention services to help children and adolescents to recover from the effects of COVID-19. Early childhood interventions are needed to help the youngest children to regain months of missed social and educational development in the crucial first 1000 days of their lives. Mental health support in schools, catch-up vaccinations, social care for vulnerable families, and funding to alleviate child poverty must be priorities. The pandemic will eventually pass, but we must not let its shadows continue to define and affect a whole generation of young people.
Caring for people who care: supporting health workers during the COVID 19 pandemic/-/As the COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us, health workers are of paramount importance to any health-care system to guarantee access to quality care for the population. According to WHO data, health workers represent less than 3% of the population of most countries, and less than 2% in low-income and middle-income countries. Yet, 14% of the COVID-19 cases reported to WHO occurred among health workers, indicating that they are at greater risk of infection than the general population. Besides their proximity to potentially infected people, health workers have been asked to work in extraordinary and extremely challenging conditions, which introduced new occupational health hazards and placed them at higher risk of disease and even death. Data availability is limited, but an Amnesty International report, published in September, stated that 7000 health workers have died from COVID-19 worldwide in the attempt to help others.The increased risk of becoming infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not the only occupational health challenge brought about by the pandemic. Long working hours and insufficient time for recuperation have also increased the risk of fatigue, mental health disorders, and burnout. In press releases in April and July this year, WHO warned that episodes of violence against health workers were increasing, as well as stigma and discrimination. There are also additional physical risks in the context of COVID-19 high workload. For example, an increase in dermatological conditions and body heat stress caused by the increased use of and higher standard of personal protection equipment (PPE), such as gloves, masks, and gowns, compared with pre-pandemic conditions, as initially signalled in March by Jiajia Lan and colleagues from the Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology.Health workers globally have expressed their discomfort with the extraordinary working conditions and in different countries felt abandoned by their own governments who failed in their duty to protect them. In the UK, health workers have expressed their appreciation of the gesture of clapping to support the NHS when coming from the public, but not from members of the government, who have been asked a more concrete support—eg, by supplying essential PPE, as reported in a letter to The Guardian on April 29. Similar situations of distress and dissatisfaction have been expressed in Spain, France, Italy, and the USA, to give just a few examples (The New York Times, March 24; The Guardian, April 25).The lack of adaptation of working conditions to the new situation puts the safety of health workers at risk, favours staff shortages, and pushes health systems to their limits and towards extreme strategies. For example, in North Dakota, USA, the Governor decided to allow asymptomatic nurses to continue to work in COVID-19 units (Grand Fork Herald, November 10). Furthermore, insufficient occupational health and safety measures can result in diminished quality of care, impacting on patients’ health. Along these lines, WHO has included workers’ health in this year's World Patient Safety Day, with the slogan “Safe Health Workers, Safe Patients”. WHO used the occasion to reiterate the call to governments and organisations to take urgent measures to protect health workers. The call echoed those made at the beginning of the pandemic, such as the appeal during the World Day for Safety and Health in April, held with the International Labour Organisation, to assure decent and safe working conditions for health workers.This call cannot fall any longer on deaf ears. With COVID-19 cases once again on the rise in different countries worldwide, it is imperative to use the knowledge gathered in these past months to put long-term occupational safety measures in place to support health workers. Robust test and trace systems must be a priority for all health-care facilities. Support groups are needed to improve mental health wellbeing, and a zero tolerance approach to violence must be promoted by governments in health-care settings. PPE must be available at all times and in adequate quality and quantity. Each health-care facility should have a focal unit to manage occupational health and safety. In this context, regulations for occupational health risk must be reviewed and upgraded, considering the established risk factors for COVID-19, such as age, ethnicity, or pre-existing clinical conditions (such as obesity and diabetes), and the deployment of health workers decided accordingly. Health workers should be ensured vaccinations against all vaccine-preventable diseases, and they should be granted priority access to newly licensed vaccines against COVID-19. All these measures, if properly established, can contribute to improving the safety of health workers and reduce staff shortages, thus allowing more balanced working shifts and better care for patients during these difficult times. Furthermore, to ensure decent working conditions, governments should work on benefits and compensation policies for those on the front line.The clapping has faded, but we need to continue to support health workers and ensure that they have what they need to face this emergency. As WHO Director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reminded us recently, “No country, hospital, or clinic can keep its patients safe unless it keeps its health workers safe”. We can all become patients at some point, the time to act is now.
Contact tracing: digital health on the frontline/-/South Korea, China, and Singapore have successfully used digital contact tracing to control the spread of COVID-19, often putting public interest above individuals' right to privacy. Despite initial enthusiasm for this approach in the USA, Israel, and Europe, privacy concerns and technical issues inhibited uptake of digital contact tracing, and recent attempts to stem the first wave of SARS-COV-2 infections failed.The Lancet Digital Health has published the first study reporting an assessment of the UK's Test and Trace contact tracing pilot programme on the Isle of Wight in May, 2020. Michelle Kendall and colleagues, who advised the UK Government on the design of the contact tracing programme, present modelling analyses that indicate significant decreases in COVID-19 incidence and R immediately after the launch of the Test and Trace programme. The Isle of Wight went from having one of the highest Rs in the UK (R=1·3) before the programme was launched on May 5, to one of the lowest (R=0·5) on June 14. The results indicate that Test and Trace interventions could have a positive impact in suppressing the UK COVID-19 epidemic. However, the study does not present causal evidence, and the data from cases traced by the contact tracing mobile app were not available, so the authors could not evaluate the effects of individual aspects of the Test and Trace programme.In April, a Rapid Review published by the Ada Lovelace Institute reported that premature deployment of ineffective apps could undermine public trust and hamper the widespread uptake of tracking technologies. Uptake during the Test and Trace pilot programme on the Isle of Wight was only 38% and, in wider roll out of the programme, uptake could be as low as 10%.In August, Braithwaite and colleagues published a Systematic Review, in which they highlighted that control of COVID-19 will require a high population uptake of contact tracing apps (56–95%). Similar to the network effect phenomenon, where increasing participants of a service directly increases the value to each user (eg, social networks), evidence of effectiveness directly affects uptake, while uptake directly affects effectiveness.In May, Microsoft Research conducted a survey of over 4500 Americans to gauge the relationship between effectiveness and installing the app. Their results suggest that more than 60% of Americans would install an app that reduces their infection rate by 50%, and more than 75% of Americans would be willing to install an app that reduces their infection rate by 97%. Therefore, transparent analysis of the efficacy of contact tracing apps is needed to better engage the public and improve the effectiveness of contact tracing programmes.In a modelling study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kucharski and colleagues concluded that contact tracing alone is not likely to contain the virus. They estimated that digital tracing alone reduced R by 44% and manual tracing of all contacts reduced R by 61%. Braithwaite and colleagues' Systematic Review did not find empirical evidence of the effectiveness of digital contact tracing without support from traditional contact tracing approaches, alongside measures such as remote working by a large proportion of the population and physical distancing.Effectiveness and uptake of technology are not the only factors in determining the success of a contact tracing programme. Other factors include whether users self-isolate and get tested quickly. Reports predict that less than 20% of people in England fully self-isolate when asked to do so. We know that people without privilege and wealth have limited capacity to self-isolate at home, therefore it is vital that contact tracing strategies recognise the financial barriers to complying with public health measures. Furthermore, inadequate testing and delays in producing results have hindered efforts to contain major outbreaks in the UK and USA.On Sept 26, SAGE warned the UK Government that the daily coronavirus death toll is set to more than double within 4 weeks. Given the scale and speed of the pandemic, digital contact tracing is imperative to curtail the second wave of COVID-19. Contact tracing must be adopted widely and integrated into public health strategies, including financial support to allow for quarantine and widespread rapid testing. The Lancet Digital Health calls for robust evaluation of global contact tracing approaches to stop the spread of SARS-COV-2 and future epidemics. The digital health community are on the frontline and, at this watershed moment, we must galvanise to end this pandemic.
Care home staff and residents on the pandemic front line/-/On Oct 20, 2020, the Andbe care home in Norton County (KS, USA) made international headlines when a single case of COVID-19 infection spread to all 62 residents and some staff members within two weeks, resulting in ten deaths and one admission to hospital. Although this case is remarkable for the speed at which the infection spread, sadly it is not an outlier: as of September, 2020, 41% of all COVID-19 deaths in the USA occurred in nursing home facilities. Nor is this trend unique to the USA. Across 21 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania almost half (48%) of all COVID-19 deaths have occurred in care homes. Both older age and frailty have been identified as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, so the message that at-risk adults should be shielded was drilled into care home staff around the world. As a result, staff have been given the almost impossible task of striking a balance between protecting vulnerable residents and minimising adverse outcomes of isolation.Lockdown restrictions, which instruct all care home residents to shield irrespective of individual circumstance, have had a huge impact on their physical and mental wellbeing. Social isolation and activity curtailment have led to exercise being supplanted by sedentary behaviour, increasing the risk of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. Moreover, the loss of regular social contact with other residents and visitors, together with restrictions on free movement, has left residents vulnerable to loneliness and depression. Consequently, residents face risks from all sides: of the 30 000 excess deaths recorded in English and Welsh care homes between March and June this year, a third were unrelated to COVID-19 but stemmed from exacerbation of pre-existing health issues.Lockdown measures are especially difficult for the many care home residents with dementia or memory problems, estimated at around 70% of people in UK care homes. Visits from loved ones are replaced by interactions with staff wearing unfamiliar, frightening personal protective equipment (PPE), leaving these residents distressed and agitated. Moreover, pre-existing psychiatric disorders have been shown to increase the risk of contracting COVID-19, and dementia has been identified as the most common pre-existing condition underlying death from COVID-19.Media coverage of outbreaks in care homes—tallying deaths and depicting homes as hubs for infection—has incited a climate of pointing fingers at staff and management. Staff, grappling with the challenge of caring for vulnerable residents, are further encumbered with negative publicity and blame for the deaths of those under their care. However, in the pursuit of culprits, there has been a failure to recognise that the system within which care homes operate has long been fractured, with the pandemic deepening these cracks. Insufficient resources, low staff wages, and understaffing plague health-care systems globally and collectively contribute to staff burnout and high turnover rates. For example, one in three employees leave the UK care home sector annually, giving it the dubious honour of being the industry with the highest turnover rates in the country.The bleak picture signals the urgency for action. In the absence of vaccines, care home shielding is a necessary evil. In the short term, evidence-based interventions can aid staff in caring for residents with complex needs (eg, WHELD and GEMH interventions). By emphasising the importance of staff–patient interactions and by providing concrete skillsets, such interventions can empower staff in their care. However, ensuring the wellbeing of staff members is equally as important as ensuring the wellbeing of the residents. Care home staff are witness to high rates of mortality of those in their care, resulting in post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health difficulties. Therefore, there must be dual focus on implementing support for both residents and overburdened staff.This support for staff must be matched with sweeping repairs to a fractured structure. Limited resources left care homes without adequate PPE and testing capacity at the start of the pandemic. Without changes, care homes will again fall victim to high infection and mortality rates in a second wave and the global outcry will resume. The excess deaths in care homes must not simply be recorded as pandemic tolls but must instead sound alarms for urgent support needed to ensure that the lives of all in care homes—residents and staff—are valued.
COVID-19 transmission—up in the air/-/As we approach the end of 2020, and a year since the outbreak of COVID-19 began, cases are increasing again. We have learnt a lot about SARS-CoV-2 and our ability to test for and manage COVID-19 has improved, but ongoing debate remains about how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted.Respiratory viruses are transmitted in three main ways. First, contact transmission, where someone comes into direct contact with an infected person or touches a surface that has been contaminated. Second, through droplet transmission of both large and small respiratory droplets that contain the virus, which would occur when near an infected person. Third, through airborne transmission of smaller droplets and particles that are suspended in the air over longer distances and time than droplet transmission.During the initial stages of the pandemic there was concern about surface transmission. However, latest research suggests that this is unlikely to be a major route of transmission as although SARS-CoV-2 can persist for days on inanimate surfaces, attempts to culture the virus from these surfaces were unsuccessful.Infection control guidelines have stated that most respiratory virus transmission occurs from large infected droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and breathing in close proximity to another person. This understanding has led to social distancing being the cornerstone of public health advice, but confusion exists as to the safe distance required between people to reduce transmission with the WHO suggesting 1 m and the CDC and NHS saying 2 m. For social distancing to be effective, infective respiratory particles would need to fall to the ground or be in low enough concentrations at 2 m from the source to not cause transmission. Studies and guidelines have historically used a threshold of 5 μm to differentiate between large and small particles, but researchers are now suggesting that a size threshold of 100 μm better differentiates aerodynamic behaviour of particles, and particles that would fall to the ground within 2 m are likely to be 60–100 μm in size. Investigators have also measured particle sizes of infectious aerosols and have shown that pathogens are most commonly found in small particle aerosols (<5 μm), which are airborne and breathable.Initially it was thought that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely, but growing evidence has highlighted that infective microdroplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air and expose individuals at distances beyond 2 m from an infected person. This knowledge is also corroborated by investigation of spread of cases between people who were not in direct or indirect contact, suggesting that airborne transmission was the most likely route. In July, over 200 scientists published a statement calling for international bodies to recognise the potential for airborne spread of COVID-19 as they were concerned that people would not be fully protected by adhering to the current recommendations.On Oct 5, 2020, the CDC updated their COVID-19 webpage to say that there is growing evidence that COVID-19 infection can occur from airborne exposure to the virus under certain circumstances. Cases of transmission from people more than 2 m apart have occurred but in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, and typically with extended exposure to an infected person of more than 30 min. The CDC have been clear to point out that most infections are spread through close contact and that airborne transmission is not the primary route of transmission.Whether droplet or airborne transmission is the main route, the risk of infection is known to be much lower outside where ventilation is better. As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, the opportunity to socialise and exercise outdoors becomes more challenging and concerns are growing over the increased risk of transmission of COVID-19. Public health guidance now needs to advise people how to navigate risk in indoor settings and wearing facemasks is becoming mandatory in many countries for travelling on public transport, indoor shopping, and gatherings. Facemasks and shields offer protection from larger droplets but their effectiveness against airborne transmission is less certain. Advice on spending time indoors should also focus on improved ventilation and avoiding crowded spaces.As 2021 draws near, people are getting tired of the disruption the pandemic has brought to their lives and their willingness to adhere to strict rules and lockdowns might wane. As cases of COVID-19 increase globally, we need to more fully understand the transmission routes. It is crucial that we embrace new research and do not rely on recommendations based on old data so that clearer and more effective infection control guidance can be provided in the face of pandemic fatigue.
Reimagining long-term care/-/A dichotomous narrative surrounds ageing in the 21st century. On the one hand, there is increasing research and recognition of healthy ageing, and a recognition that age is not synonymous with ill health. On the other hand, there is the fear of looming economic costs and providing care for increasing numbers of older people with increasingly complex needs. These two narratives are hard to marry. Even the name long-term care (given to the latter narrative) is at odds with a short-term neoliberal political economy and, as a result, is generally low on government agendas. Many societies are so caught up in viewing individuals as contributors to the economy only that they have devalued the lives of older people. Nothing shows this denigration more than the fact that in April only five countries had data on older people living in care homes and COVID-19 infection rates. Or, furthermore, the nasty libertarian question during COVID-19 over why we are damaging the economy for members of society that are regarded as economically inactive. In fact, between 2008 and 2018 people older than 55 years accounted for 79% of employment growth across OECD countries, and there is evidence that the market activities and productive non-market activities of older people (volunteering, caring, and supporting) make up a good proportion of the gross domestic product in many countries. But surely, regardless of economic activity, we want to live in a world where all lives are valued equally?Nursing homes do not have salubrious origins. In the UK, during the 1800s older people who could not support themselves financially or had no family to look after them were housed in workhouses—institutions with conditions so grim that Thomas Wakley called them “the antechambers to the grave”. In 1920, many of these buildings were turned into nursing homes and, in a move of pure convenience, the residential care home was born. Thankfully, conditions have improved, but many care homes are still not very good at either caring or being a home, in the comforting, emotional sense in which people have control over their environment and feel safe. The International Long-Term Care Policy Network (a collaboration of researchers) has reported that in 21 countries, on average, nearly half of all COVID-19 deaths have been in care home residents (although data are poor and inconsistently measured). COVID-19 has been linked to the deaths of more than 4% of the population living in care homes in the USA, the UK, Spain, and Belgium. Care homes cannot be called safe.In The Lancet, a policy document looking at China's long-term care system highlights recurring global problems—a rapidly growing, often private, institutional care sector, the slow and small development of home and community-based care (despite a desire to increase home care, years of conflicting policy measures have in fact incentivised institutional care), inconsistent data monitoring, shortages in workforces, poor regulation, poor governance, and a lack of organised financing.The world is beginning to wake up to the importance of healthy ageing. The 73rd World Health Assembly endorsed the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020–2030 and a broad agenda (including guidance on long-term care) will aim to lengthen the time older people spend in good health—ie, increasing healthspan, rather than lifespan. The Lancet Healthy Longevity, a clinical journal addressing all aspects of healthy ageing, publishes its first issue this week.Concurrent with political and academic engagement in this aspect of ageing is the need to reconcile and embrace the inevitable requirement that many people will need extra care as they age. Long-term care must value the heritage, experience, and contribution of older people, and see them as individuals who are part of a wider social network. Some countries already do so. Denmark stopped building care homes in the 1980s and older people living in social housing with care facilities are considered tenants. Singapore is building integrated, so-called enabled communities, where residents are fellow citizens who contribute to a resilient society. Long-term care should be diverse, focusing on the importance of a home and community with multi-generational possibilities, with built environments designed for older people, and access to flexible and high-quality care, reflecting the many and unique ways that people age. The care workforce must be valued and receive better training, better pay, and a structured career path that reflects their important and highly skilled roles. Traditional care homes should be a last resort. The dehumanising way that COVID-19 has been managed in people in care homes makes a mockery of the purpose of medicine to extend life and allow people to live life in the fullest sense. The long-term care system in many countries is broken and must be reimagined.For The Lancet Healthy Longevity see https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/homeFor The Lancet Healthy Longevity see https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/home
COVID-19 in Spain: a predictable storm?/-/As of Oct 12, there have been 861 112 confirmed cases and 32 929 deaths due to COVID-19 in Spain. More than 63 000 health-care workers have been infected. Spain was one of the most affected countries during the first wave of COVID-19 (March to June), and it has now been hit hard again by a second wave of COVID-19 infections. While the reasons behind this poor outcome are still to be fully understood, Spain's COVID-19 crisis has magnified weaknesses in some parts of the health system and revealed complexities in the politics that shape the country.The COVID-19 pandemic tested health system resilience and pandemic preparedness. Despite the creation in 2004 of a Centre for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergency, the pandemic laid bare the country's “weak surveillance systems, low capacity for PCR tests, and scarcity of personal protective equipment and critical care equipment, a delayed reaction by central and regional authorities, slow decision-making processes, high levels of population mobility and migration, poor coordination among central and regional authorities, low reliance on scientific advice, an ageing population, vulnerable groups experiencing health and social inequalities, and a lack of preparedness in nursing homes”, according to 20 Spanish public health leaders writing in August in The Lancet.The Spanish health system's four pillars—governance, financing, delivery, and workforce—were already fragile when they were overwhelmed by COVID-19 in March. A decade of austerity that followed the 2008 financial crisis had reduced the health workforce and public health and health system capacities. Health services are understaffed, under-resourced, and under strain. With 5·9 nurses per 1000 inhabitants, Spain has one of the lowest ratios in the EU (where the average is 9·3 per 1000), and too often relies on temporary contracts that can run for just a few days or weeks.Granular data surveillance is key for understanding and responding to an outbreak. For Sergi Trias-Llimós and colleagues, writing in The Lancet Public Health, the data currently published at the country and regional levels are insufficient to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. They call on authorities to provide comprehensive data updates on tests, cases, hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, recoveries, and deaths, all disaggregated by age, sex, and geography.The test-trace-isolate tryptic, which is the cornerstone of the response to the pandemic, remains weak—COVID-19 cases are increasing alarmingly, and authorities are again looking at lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus. When the national lockdown was lifted in June, some regional authorities were probably too fast at reopening and too slow at implementing an efficient track and trace system. In some regions, the local epidemiological control infrastructure was insufficient to control future outbreaks and limit community transmission. Spain's political polarisation and decentralised governance might also have hampered the rapidity and efficiency of the public health response. Whereas the first wave might have been unpredictable, the second wave in some parts of Spain was quite predictable, Rafael Bengoa (Institute for Health and Strategy, Bilbao, and former Minister of Health Basque Country) told The Lancet Public Health.In an attempt to identify areas where public health and the health and social care system need to be improved, Alberto García-Basteiro and colleagues, in their Letter in The Lancet Public Health, urged the Spanish central and regional governments to set up an independent evaluation of their COVID-19 responses, and lay down the requirements and principles for such an evaluation. The evaluation should start immediately, should build consensus among society, and requires firm commitment from the central and regional governments; the evaluation committee should be independent, diverse and multidisciplinary, the evaluation should be broad in scope (health, economic, and social effects) and providing recommendations. Such an independent evaluation will be key to reassure the population and rebuild trust in the Government's approach to public health.And there are reasons for hope. In the latest Global Burden of Disease analysis, published in The Lancet, health indicators (such as life expectancy and healthy life expectancy) suggest that Spain overperforms, with indicators better than would be predicted according to the country's socio-demographic index. If Spain's political leaders can draw the lessons from their sub-optimal response to COVID-19, the country is very well placed to give its population a bright and healthy future.
Mental health: time to invest in quality/-/The theme of this year's World Mental Health Day, on Oct 10, is increased investment in mental health. Why invest, and why now? The answer is simple. At the best of times, good mental health is needed for a society to thrive. During a pandemic, good mental health is more important than ever. Without a focus on mental health, any response to COVID-19 will be deficient, reducing individual and societal resilience, and impeding social, economic, and cultural recovery.2020 has been a difficult year for mental health. The threat of infection, repeated lockdowns, social isolation, and economic uncertainty have created widespread fear and anxiety. A Rapid Review published in The Lancet showed the negative psychological effects of enforced quarantines. Many people who previously thought themselves unaffected by mental health issues have discovered that they, too, are vulnerable. Those with pre-existing mental health conditions have often found their difficulties increased. The precise neurological and psychiatric consequences of infection, meanwhile, remain unknown but demand careful monitoring. What investment is needed from governments and non-governmental organisations to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 and, more importantly, to improve mental health globally?In 2018, the Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development identified mental health as an essential component of universal health coverage and provided recommendations to improve mental health—eg, to involve a broader range of stakeholders in planning and delivering mental health services, most importantly those who have lived experience of mental health disorders. Their voices need to be not only heard but welcomed into the development of new systems of service delivery.Regrettably, despite commitment from world leaders to include mental health care in universal health coverage as part of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, this pledge was not translated into reality. Universal health coverage would provide a lifeline for those trapped in the vicious cycle of economic hardship and poor mental health, where poverty is both a contributing factor to mental health problems and a barrier to accessing services that might help. Investment needs to increase in quantity and in terms of quality. For example, great strides have been made in the delivery of telepsychiatry over the past 10 months; individuals who receive these services must be instrumental in their future use and development. This involvement will ensure that telepsychiatry is used in an intelligent, targeted manner that provides appropriate support, rather than being a cost-saving, one-size-fits-all measure that risks exacerbating health inequalities or inadvertently reinforcing social isolation.According to a WHO survey, people with pre-existing severe and enduring mental health conditions have been most affected by COVID-19-related disruptions of mental health-care systems. Other vulnerable groups include children and adolescents, many of whom have been impacted by school closures, stretched health systems, restricted access to nutritious food, breakdown in family relationships, neglect, and abuse. Older adults are also vulnerable. Many with pre-existing health conditions are terrified and lonely, afraid of infection, dying, and losing family members while physically distanced from loved ones and peers. Finally there are health-care workers themselves, who also face a greater risk of infection, stigmatisation, and stressful workloads, with the attendant psychological repercussions. Investment in mental health is also about investment in health-care workers.The economic argument for investment in mental health services is clear and has been made many times, but there is also an ethical imperative for investment, both to redress historic wrongs done to vulnerable communities and to right current inequities. On a global scale, this strategy involves the empowerment of individuals and communities, the admission that high-income countries have much to learn from the innovations of low-income and middle-income settings, and the recognition of the central role of mental health in global health security now and in the future. Investment must be about more than just money if mental health services are to be made fit to address the challenges of the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 era and to become resilient against future public health crises. There must be an investment of thought, time, and a commitment to change.
The intersection of COVID-19 and mental health/-/On Oct 6, 2020, WHO published the results of a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) services in 130 WHO Member States, ahead of World Mental Health Day on Oct 10. The survey revealed that most countries are experiencing some disruption to MNS services, with the greatest impact on community-based and prevention and promotion services. Reasons for disruption included an insufficient number or redeployment of health workers to the COVID-19 response (in 30% of countries), use of mental health facilities as COVID-19 quarantine or treatment facilities (in 19% of countries), and insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (in 28% of countries). Although 116 (89%) countries reported that mental health and psychological support was part of their national COVID-19 response plans, only 17% said they had committed additional funding for this. This report comes on the back of mounting evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is having monumental effects on the mental health and wellbeing of populations worldwide. With seemingly low capacity to respond, it is unclear how the world will deal with this looming mental health crisis.Historical examples show the detrimental impact events such as a pandemic can have on the mental health of affected populations. For example, research from communities affected by outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) revealed widespread panic and anxiety, depression resulting from the sudden deaths of friends, relatives, and colleagues, and stigmatisation and social exclusion of survivors. A meta-analysis found that depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory, and insomnia were present in 33–42% of patients admitted to hospital for severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, and that in some cases these effects continued beyond recovery.In the case of COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), although essential to halt transmission of the virus, have led to physical isolation, closure of schools (with untold effects on the development and wellbeing of children), and widespread job losses. Misuse of substances, particularly alcohol, is rising. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 could even have direct neurological consequences. And as with many other features of this pandemic, not all people have been affected equally. Disruptions to MNS services, as reported by WHO, are disproportionately affecting people with pre-existing mental health conditions by limiting access to essential treatment and support services. People with salaried jobs are far less likely to be affected than those with informal, daily wage jobs, which include a substantial proportion of the workforce in lower-income countries. Frontline workers are experiencing increased workload and trauma, making them susceptible to stress, burnout, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Even under normal circumstances, good mental health is crucial to the functioning of society. During a pandemic, however, it can affect how we respond and recover. Health-care workers are essential to the COVID-19 response but may have to leave the workforce if their mental health is not protected. Mental ill health may also affect uptake of a vaccine and adherence to NPIs, with some evidence suggesting that poor mental health could increase susceptibility to infection and transmission of the virus. For example, a study in Sierra Leone found that EVD risk behaviours were associated with intensity of depression symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and war exposure. People with dementia might be at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 because of difficulty in remembering instructions for, and importance of, physical distancing and hand hygiene. Confinement of people with and without mental illness in institutions can increase their risk of infection, as witnessed in long-term care facilities and prisons.Even before COVID-19, mental health conditions were prevalent, accounting for about 13% of the global burden of disease. Yet, the world was woefully unprepared to deal with the mental health impact of this pandemic. Years of underinvestment in mental health, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, have left us vulnerable. It is well known that our ability to respond to, and recover from, the COVID-19 pandemic will require development of effective vaccines and treatments and strict adherence to NPIs. Less well known is that to minimise the impact of the pandemic, we must also address the substantial unmet mental health needs of whole societies, with a focus on the most vulnerable.For WHO's survey on MNS services see https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/978924012455

Food for thought during school closures/-/Since March, 2020, countries around the world have imposed nationwide school closures in an attempt to help reduce the burden of COVID-19. Ensuring that children safely return to the classroom at the start of the new school year has been a top priority for many nations in the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately, school attendance has been patchy, with schools in areas with high infection rates remaining closed. In other places, entire year groups have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days if a positive case is found in the same year group or contact bubble.The true cost of keeping schools closed for long periods of time is difficult to evaluate because the effect goes well beyond the obvious disruption to learning and social development. One of the less apparent consequences of school closure is the double impact on childrens' nutrition. On one hand, there is concern that rates of overweight and obesity will increase owing to the lack of opportunities for children to be physically active and the skipping of regular healthy meals, which might instead get replaced by all-day snacking. On the other hand, children who depend on free or reduced-price school meals might no longer have adequately nutritious diets. In one study in the USA, researchers estimated that between March 9 and May 1, students who receive free and reduced-price meals missed more than 1·15 billion school breakfasts and lunches because of school closures. In the UK, a voucher system was announced in March to provide support to low-income families whose children were eligible for free school meals, but the programme did not run as smoothly as hoped.With a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the anxiety associated with a second wave creeping up on Europe, many countries again face the prospect of a full or partial lockdown. Governments must prioritise measures to ensure that all children remain physically active and consume healthy and nutritious diets. For every child on the planet, this is a dish best served daily.
Building a resilient NHS, for COVID-19 and beyond/-/The UK response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been ill prepared, patchy, confused, and incompetent. From initial equivocations, to a series of policy U turns and conflicts with scientific advisers, to vague public health guidance, the UK's COVID-19 performance has fallen disastrously short and undoubtedly cost lives. It has pushed the National Health Service (NHS) to the brink. Having wasted a summer of opportunity to strengthen systems to suppress viral transmission following an easing of lockdown restrictions, the UK Government is facing a winter wave of COVID-19 with no strategy in sight. Lives, wellbeing, economic recovery, and public trust are at stake—but the government is still failing.Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has sharply escalated. The Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser implied on Sept 21 that the UK could have about 50 000 cases per day by mid-October, and 200 deaths per day by mid-November. In a worst-case scenario, this second wave could result in 81 000 excess deaths from COVID-19 by March, 2021, and 27 000 excess deaths unrelated to COVID-19. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called the NHS “beloved”. But without more support, NHS hospitals will again be overwhelmed by admissions. Without a plan to address the alarming levels of NHS staff stress and absenteeism, and 44 000 nursing vacancies, the system could collapse.The government's preparedness for a second wave is piecemeal: an order of personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid the shortages that put NHS staff at risk in the first wave; more acute care beds for patients with COVID-19, without corresponding plans to avoid the obliteration of non-COVID care; and a thin joint statement on Sept 25 from UK leaders appealing to individuals to adhere to behavioural advice. None of these pieces constitute a plan. What is urgently needed is a strategy for protecting the public and health-care workers. Where is the long-term vision for supporting the NHS and the health of the nation?Guidance is provided in a July, 2020, report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, which sets out a blueprint for building a resilient NHS. The report argues that the fragmented NHS was neither robust enough nor adaptable enough to withstand the shock of COVID-19, gutted by a decade of budget cuts due to austerity policies. That NHS staff overcame such system insufficiencies to care for tens of thousands of patients is a triumph of dedication and compassion. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the damage caused by stealth cuts, and the government's misguided short-termism and inefficiency. Lessons from COVID-19, the report says, demand that long-term thinking and funding are prerequisites for building a strong health-care system.The report identifies three priorities—capacity, resourcing, and public health—that should lay an immediate foundation for a government strategy. Capacity lost before the pandemic must be regained with immediate catch-up funding for the NHS, as well as sustained funding to meet upcoming demands in both the acute care and community sectors. A staffing plan needs to confront the crisis levels of vacancies and the capacity needs for future disease outbreaks or shocks, an ageing population, and the wellbeing of health workers, including ease of immigration. Long overdue capital investments in physical structures and in digital tools are resourcing priorities. Attention to public health is essential to ensure the population is healthy and resilient to future threats. Past promises by the government to tackle obesity, inequalities, and cancer care need to be revived urgently.Fundamentally, investments in workforce, technology, and population health measures must be in the public sector. The government's attempts to buy COVID-19 capacity in the private sector, for everything from PPE and testing, to contact tracing and training health workers, have failed. NHS expertise is there but overlooked. Outsourcing to private companies has led to charges of profiteering, nepotism, and corruption—further eroding trust in the government. Success in other countries, by contrast, has come from strong national leadership, public investment in health systems, community engagement, and clear government communication.Among the bitter truths from the first wave are that British exceptionalism, dithering leadership, perverse marketisation, and short-term thinking are an ineffective basis for protecting health. A glaring vacuum exists for the UK Government to fill. In tackling the second wave of COVID-19, it is not just the virus that needs to be overcome. It is also the government's recalcitrance to developing the long-term strategy needed to build a resilient NHS.
Dear Mr. President, you can't lie your way out of this pandemic!/-/“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.” — President Trump, Oct 19, 2020It is now late October 2020 and it has become staggeringly clear that the US Government failed the US population in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, failed to protect lives and caused unnecessary deaths. EClinicalMedicine is joining leading medical and scientific journals such as The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, and Nature to voice our deepest concerns and disapproval of the President's response to the pandemic. Only a few days before the US election we are facing the sad reality that ignorance, lies, incompetence, and an absolute lack of any kind of action plan led to the biggest public health failure in US history. The USA has the worst COVID-19-related mortality outcome compared with any other country. Yes, the current administration has left the American public on the mountain top to die.How did we get to this point? There are a lot of issues to discuss, and of course nobody expected the response to be perfect right from the beginning. During the early days of the pandemic, every country around the world was scrambling to understand and detain the virus, but whereas most countries implemented public health measures and communicated these as one clear message, the US response appeared rather scattered and inconsistent. While first steps were taken by the White House in late January to implement the so-called Coronavirus Task Force led by scientists and leading health and medical institutions such as the US National Institute of Health, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, soon these institutions were discredited and their independence and power was threatened. We saw a series of manipulations, redactions, and complete rewrites of CDC guidelines by the White House when it came to re-opening of the states and schools, testing criteria and mitigation strategies. Similarly, recent emergency use authorisations of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma therapies were granted by the US FDA upon political pressure and then later retracted. The damage was done to the trustworthiness of these institutions to the extent that other leading organisations needed to issue statements advising against such treatments. And in terms of the US CDC, more than 1000 current and former CDC officers felt the need to write an open letter in the Wall Street Journal urging the agency to play a more central role in the federal response to the virus.Again, we ask, how did we get to this point? During a major public health threat, policies, and political messaging needs to be guided by science and long-standing epidemiological knowledge and measures. The current administration, and especially President Trump, have not only ignored basic scientific facts on masks, mitigation, and testing, but have also spread misinformation and politized every measure tried to put in place to stop the spread of the virus. City mayors were sued by Republican governors because they tried to implement universal mask mandates during the midst of the pandemic. The use of masks is one of the most simple yet most powerful tools to combat this pandemic, but the administration and President Trump refuse to endorse their use, and go even further by mocking people wearing masks. Such reckless behaviour recently caused a superspreader event in the White House, with the President contracting the virus. Some would have hoped for a change in the handling of the virus afterwards, but the President continues to hold big rallies and events both outdoors and inside and keeps ignoring basic facts about death and infection rates. His politicisation of the virus and public health measures such as mask wearing, has influenced the administration response and mostly prevented any re-evaluation of the strategy as the death tolls keeps raising. Afterall, this resulted in excessive death of family members, friends, parents and children. And why – to save the economy? To ensure the re-election? The economy and unemployment rates would be better off at this point if the US would have reacted appropriately early in the pandemic. And in regard to the re-election, well, this will be in the hands of the American people.It's not just the ignorance of science; more dangerous is probably the creation of a parallel reality by the repetition of lies. President Trump and his administration have repeatedly lied to the US public about the threat of the virus. They lied about the seriousness of the virus, they lied about the efficiency of masks, they lied about testing capacities, and they keep lying. The virus is not disappearing, not everyone who wants a test can get a test, we are not in great shape, we are not bending the corner, and there is no treatment for all! President Trump and his administration keep repeating the same lies over and over—in interviews, during rallies, and at press conferences. “If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.” We heard this during the second world war. The dogma goes further and states that “the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie.” One can only hope that the painful sacrifice of all the lives taken, has, in the most disturbing manner, exposed the lies of the current administration and showed the truth to the American public and that we will see this in the outcome of the upcoming US election.
COVID-19 and diabetes: a co-conspiracy?/-/Patients with diabetes have been in the spotlight since the early stages of the pandemic, as growing epidemiological data have revealed they are at higher risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.In light of these findings, several diabetes federations around the world have issued statements and provided resources to help patients with diabetes to better understand their risk of COVID-19 and how to more efficiently manage their condition. In May, 2020, with the understanding that the evidence base was still a moving target but that guidance for clinicians was urgently needed, an international panel of experts in the field of diabetes and endocrinology published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during the pandemic.However, epidemiological data and guidance on COVID-19 and diabetes have focused almost exclusively on type 2 diabetes. In this issue of The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, we publish research assessing the absolute and relative risks of COVID-19 related mortality by type of diabetes in more than 61 000 000 individuals in England. After adjusting for key confounders, such as age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, and geographical region, the odds for in-hospital deaths with COVID-19 were 3·51 (95% CI 3·16–3·90) for people with type 1 diabetes and 2·03 (1·97–2·09) for people with type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. Understanding which risk factors might have a role in the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is a priority for clinical practice and public health. A companion paper published in the same issue used a national dataset linked to national civil death registrations covering 98% of general practices in England to investigate the associations between various risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with both types of diabetes. The authors confirmed the independent associations of several risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, with COVID-19-related death. Importantly, the study also shows that the risk of COVID-19-related mortality is significantly and independently related to hyperglycaemia in people with either type of diabetes.Hyperglycaemia can impair host defences, and poor glycaemic control has been associated with infections. Given that glycaemic control is a modifiable factor and can be achieved and sustained by health-care interventions, these results emphasise the importance of supporting people with diabetes in effective self-management.As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it has also become clear that the interplay between COVID-19 and diabetes entails a complex pathophysiology. Not only are COVID-19 outcomes more severe in people with diabetes and metabolic dysfunction, but recent data also suggest that COVID-19 could precipitate acute metabolic complications of diabetes, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycaemia. The mechanisms underlying these links remain unclear, but are likely to involve the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a binding site for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is expressed in key metabolic organs, such as the pancreas, and in β cells in particular. Potentially, the SARS-CoV-2 tropism for β cells could lead to cell damage and an impairment in insulin secretion, triggering hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis.It has also been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can precipitate type 1 diabetes onset. Data collected between March and June, 2020, from five paediatric inpatient units from four National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, indicate an increase in the number of new type 1 diabetes cases in children compared with a typical year, although causality cannot be established at this stage. Important information is likely to emerge from much larger and comprehensive datasets. To this end, in June, 2020, an international group of diabetes experts announced the launch of CoviDIAB, a global registry of COVID-19-related diabetes. This registry aims to investigate the extent and pathogenesis of new-onset diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in pre-existing patients with diabetes to help uncover novel mechanisms of disease and define the best interventions.Understanding the bidirectional interactions between diabetes and COVID-19 will be crucial to help to protect and manage people with diabetes or at high risk of metabolic dysfunction. As rates of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to increase worldwide, now more than ever, NCD prevention and control must be a priority.
Public Health England's political end/-/Public Health England (PHE), formed in 2013, is an executive agency of the UK responsible for public health activities across England with a mission statement “to protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities”. The agency has played a large part in England's HIV response through surveillance and the national prevention programme, which provides education and information on HIV prevention and facilitates access to HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PHE has also been integral to the UK's COVID-19 response, but on Aug 18, the UK Government announced that PHE would be replaced with the National Institute for Health Protection. The new agency will combine the activities of PHE with the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace service for COVID-19. Amidst substantive criticism of the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the reorganisation can be seen as an attempt to shift blame, which some fear could jeopardise the good work done by PHE, not least in HIV.PHE's HIV Prevention Innovation Fund provides funds for local, imaginative, and targeted HIV prevention projects across England and has supported projects such as The Grass is always Grindr, a YouTube drama series, and Sex Talk on National Prison Radio. PHE has also shown a commitment to lived experience with the Positive Voices survey of people living with HIV in England and Wales. During the COVID-19 pandemic PHE has supported the work of 56 Dean Street's Time to Test campaign, which aims to use social distancing to identify everyone who has undiagnosed HIV, and set up a website to order free HIV tests. Although the decision by NHS England, the body responsible for the commissioning side of the NHwwS in England, to run a trial instead of fully funding PrEP in England has been controversial, PHE has helped to run the PrEP Impact Trial, which has provided PrEP to 26 000 participants.The UK (including England) has seen substantial progress in its HIV response and has a goal of zero HIV transmissions by 2030. The most recent data from PHE show that 93% of those living in the UK with HIV are aware of their status, 97% of those aware of their status are on treatment, and 97% of those on treatment are virally suppressed—surpassing each of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for 2020, and exceeding the 2030 goal of 86% of people virally suppressed. However, gains have been uneven with those living outside London less likely to be aware of their status and, in 2018, late diagnosis made up 43% of new diagnoses.At present, details on the reorganisation are scarce, and the impact on PHE's HIV activities unclear. Several UK HIV organisations (Terrence Higgins Trust, National AIDS Trust, British HIV Association, British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, and the UK Community Advisory Board HIV treatment advocates network) released a joint statement expressing their concern “that structural changes could risk a reversal of the progress that has been made to date”. They have called for renewed commitment to goals such as ending new HIV transmissions by 2030 and delivering a national PrEP programme.Reorganisation of the body responsible for public health in England during a pandemic is an unusual move. It is hard not to see it as a political decision to allow PHE to shoulder the blame for government shortcomings during COVID-19. The decision to appoint the current head of NHS Test and Trace, Dido Harding, as interim head of the new agency, has not helped allay fears of political bias. Harding has limited experience of public health but is married to a Member of Parliament for the governing Conservative Party. Harding's suitability for the role, even temporarily, is further called into question by the record of NHS Test and Trace, which since mid-June has failed in its target to reach 80% of people who test positive for COVID-19. The new leader and her eventual successor would do well to retain and draw on the expertise of PHE staff.
Clinical research: further COVID-19 collateral damage/-/More than 1500 clinical studies run by the NHS have been permanently closed in Britain in the wake of COVID-19, with a further 9000 suspended, representing a disruption of 70% of NHS research, according to a report in The Observer. Elsewhere, an analysis of trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov since 2017 indicated the rate of trial closure has increased significantly during the pandemic period versus the pre-pandemic era.COVID-19 has forced a rapid rethinking of many aspects of clinical research. New means to ensure the integrity of ongoing trials have had to be adopted: telemedicine has allowed patient follow-up to continue while respecting social distancing regulations and avoiding unnecessary travel for at-risk patients, for instance. Lack of access to clinical facilities has led to a move to remote safety assessment—eg, lab monitoring in the community or via home visits. Ensuring that participants continue to receive investigational products has meant shipping of drugs directly to patients.Despite rapid adaptation, output will undoubtedly be diminished. Funding for non-COVID-19 research is likely to prove scarce; even funding heavyweights such as Cancer Research UK have announced severe cuts to their research funding as a result of the pandemic. For underfunded areas, such as many digestive conditions, this could be a major challenge. Ongoing trials are likely to see increased protocol deviations and violations, and those relying on invasive monitoring (eg, endoscopy for luminal gastroenterology trials) may find themselves with substantial missing data given restricted access to services. Finding willing participants may also prove challenging due to fears of contracting COVID-19 during clinic visits.Many of the adaptations made thus far can be adopted more widely. Telemedicine offers increased opportunities to enrol and monitor patients from afar, using remote platforms to collect data. Such moves may help bring down overall costs while also potentially mitigating patients' concerns regarding COVID-19-related risks. Nonetheless, difficult discussions lie ahead regarding what clinical research is deemed essential and what are added extras.For The Observer report see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/22/coronavirus-pandemic-halts-life-saving-uk-cancer-and-heart-disease-research

High-stakes heterogeneity in COVID-19/-/As all rheumatologists know, one size rarely fits all. An insufficient understanding of patient heterogeneity and its implications for prognosis and therapeutic response has contributed to numerous failed trials and insufficient treatment options in many rheumatic diseases. The same is true for COVID-19, for which understanding patient heterogeneity is a high-stakes endeavour. Such understanding could help clinicians to treat patients earlier and with the most effective therapies, potentially making the difference between life and death.Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop only mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. A minority develop severe disease, however, and require hospitalisation; a small percentage of those develop life-threatening hyperinflammation. Thus far, treatment of these patients has been mostly reactionary, based on supportive care and close monitoring, with escalation of treatment in those whose conditions deteriorate. An ability to determine which patients are most at risk of developing or progressing to severe disease would facilitate a more proactive approach.Cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders have informed treatment of patients with COVID-19 and ongoing trials. However, as we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, disparities between patients start to outweigh commonalities. In this issue of The Lancet Rheumatology, Jessica Manson and colleagues delineate a high-risk hyperinflammatory (COV-HI) phenotype in a cohort of UK patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19. Defined by two readily available clinical variables—C-reactive protein and ferritin—the COV-HI phenotype was associated with poor patient outcomes and predicted (by at least a day) need for increased respiratory support in nearly 75% of patients. Initial data from the COVID–ImmunoPhenotype (COVID-IP) project revealed that concentrations of a trio of circulating cytokines and chemokines—interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10; also known as CXCL10), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-6—predicted subsequent clinical progression among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (of varying severity).A clearer understanding of patient heterogeneity might not only help clinicians to anticipate which patients are likely to require more aggressive treatment but also, in time, which therapies are most likely to benefit an individual patient. Inhibitors of cytokine pathways, including IL-1 (anakinra), IL-6 (tocilizumab, sarilumab), and GM-CSF (mavrilimumab), have shown some benefit in observational cohorts, although conclusive evidence awaits results of ongoing randomised trials. In one study, tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced mortality in a cohort of 764 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring support in the intensive care unit, particularly in those with evidence of hyperinflammation. However, we still have a long way to go in predicting which patients might respond to specific cytokine inhibitors or to broader immunosuppression.Emerging data from observational studies can also help to inform trial design. Both timing of treatment and patient stratification (eg, by evidence for hyperinflammation) could be key to determining trial success or failure; indeed, an absence of stratification for inflammatory phenotype might have contributed to the failure of two high-profile trials of tocilizumab in COVID-19. Post-hoc analysis of these negative trials will be essential to tease out whether particular subsets of patients might have benefitted from treatment.Clues to patient heterogeneity and variability of clinical disease trajectories in patients with COVID-19 are also emerging from immunological studies. T cell responses might be key for long-term immunity; indeed, studies have shown that many people test positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, including some who tested negative for antibodies. Early vaccine trials have shown evidence for robust antiviral T cell responses, and preliminary data from a French case series showed that the T cell-boosting cytokine IL-7 safely increased T cell numbers in 12 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and severe lymphopenia. A trial of IL-7 is currently underway in the UK. A COVID-19 immune cell signature has been described, in which altered T cell phenotypes correlated with disease severity, and a paucity of T cells in blood better predicted length of hospital stay than did inflammatory markers such as IL-6.There is no one-size-fits all scenario for COVID-19, but we have already made progress towards understanding heterogeneity and the importance of patient stratification for improving outcomes. With evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be eliminated any time soon, it is crucial to continue deciphering pieces of the COVID-19 heterogeneity puzzle.
COVID-19: we will not be returning to the old normal/-/Recently there has been a gradual shift in the COVID-19 discourse based on an acknowledgement that clearer communication is needed to manage public expectations. Although not directly factored into this shift of tone, the so-called fatalism effect can teach us something. This concept essentially warns that if a problem is characterised as nearly insurmountable then many people will just give up. These people surmise that the cost of the intervention is not worth it, given they perceive that the cost yields little benefit. Conversely, it is also important to guard against overly optimistic assessments, such as those from certain governments relating to a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Many governments have confidently asserted, without due consideration of the consequences, that a vaccine will abruptly end the pandemic.Given the potential for misunderstanding at this point, let us be clear: an approved vaccine will be beneficial and its uptake should be strongly encouraged, but it can only be a part of the solution. The reason a vaccine cannot be the complete solution is illustrated with the three vaccine scenarios recently put forth by Zain Chagla, Isaac Bogoch, and Sumon Chakrabarti: a vaccine that prevents nearly all person-to-person spread (presumably also halting illness; scenario 1), one that prevents some spread and reduces severe illness and death (scenario 2), and one that does not prevent spread but reduces severe illness and death (scenario 3). At this stage of clinical assessment it is difficult to be certain whether the real vaccines will fit into scenario 2 or 3. They are unlikely to fit into scenario 1, although even this scenario would not be an instantaneous solution given the mind-boggling logistics of delivering a vaccine to over 7 billion people.All the vaccine scenarios will require that the mitigation measures employed worldwide continue for a few years at least. Of course, the scenario 1 vaccine would, in time, allow us to reach a point where other measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 become unnecessary. Ideally, in a show of global solidarity, the measures would be retained until the world had largely brought COVID-19 under control. However, it would be naive to assume that individual nations would not lift restrictions as soon as possible. The other scenarios are more tricky propositions and illustrate that political optimism can be genuinely dangerous. If we use the scenario 3 vaccine as our example, this might eliminate severe and potentially deadly disease in those able to receive the vaccine, but the virus would still be able to spread through the population unhindered. So those unable to receive the vaccine, a group which overlaps with many groups current measures are protecting, would be unprotected.For months many governments have proclaimed that a vaccine is the complete solution, without any mention that not all potential vaccines will fill this role. Nonetheless, some quarters will push to roll out a vaccine, irrespective of its properties, and abandon other measures. It is not unreasonable for the public to expect this drive, given the failure to manage expectations to date. In this setting most people would experience little disease but those who currently are at greatest risk would find themselves completely exposed. This would be an inversion of the underlying principles guiding current interventions. Some might see this characterisation as absurd, but we have seen the world over how easily physical distancing seems to have been abandoned when people are led to believe, deliberately or otherwise, that new measures replace rather than complement earlier interventions.Often it is difficult to offer solutions, but it is straightforward in this case: interventions that have been in use since early in the pandemic, most crucially physical distancing and hand hygiene, must continue indefinitely. The benefits of these simple measures will have far-reaching implications as shown in a news story in this issue by Paul Adepoju, which describes how work to control neglected tropical diseases has benefitted from the drive for improved hygiene in response to the pandemic. It might be that the vaccines that ultimately become available are more like those described under scenario 2: slowing transmission in addition to limiting illness and death. This scenario will be more welcome than scenario 3 but will not change the need to maintain earlier interventions in place. It is time to forcefully impress on people that basic measures to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are here to stay. This is the new normal.For more on the fatalism effect see https://www.nber.org/papers/w27245

COVID-19 in India: the dangers of false optimism/-/Despite a strong response at the outset of the pandemic, as of Sept 22, India has the world's fastest growing outbreak of COVID-19 in absolute numbers according to WHO, reporting more than 5·6 million infections. Restrictions began to be lifted in June, and this relaxation has continued in the face of a continuing dramatic increase in case numbers nationally. Beneath these alarming national figures, the pattern of spread in India is nuanced and complex, with marked differences between states, and between rural and urban areas. For example, cities like Kolkata and rural areas in the north of India were relatively spared the outbreak initially, whereas Delhi, with strong international connections, was at the forefront of the first wave. Even so, India is clearly facing a dangerous period.The country has responded well in many regards, especially for such a large and diverse nation. India instigated a national lockdown in March, which was praised by WHO. During the lockdown period, tertiary care provision was increased, including access to specialist equipment such as ventilators. Testing numbers also increased quickly, with India being among the first to roll out innovations like pooled testing. India has also been at the forefront of efforts to develop and manufacture a vaccine, both through domestic vaccine candidates and manufacturers such as the Serum Institute of India preparing production capacity for internationally developed vaccine candidates.Difficulties remain. The lockdown created a parallel crisis for many people as income fell dramatically, hunger increased, and many migrant workers walked long distances home. India's GDP was already decreasing before COVID-19 but the contraction of almost 25% year on year in the quarter April to June could make India one of the worst affected countries economically. As the outbreak has spread from its initial foothold in cities to smaller urban areas and villages, pre-existing disparities in health-care provision have become increasingly relevant. Rural health infrastructure in India can be sparse, and some smaller private hospitals have reported equipment shortages, especially oxygen.Most crucially, the rapidly growing case numbers, alongside the continuing relaxation of restrictions, are creating an atmosphere of fatalism mingled with false optimism that undermines effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and physical distancing. The epidemic in India is far from over, with a potentially huge burden of mortality and morbidity to come unless public health measures are used and adhered to. Without clear and honest communication of the risks of COVID-19 to the population, stemming the epidemic will be impossible.According to news reports, hours before announcing the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told owners and editors from India's largest media organisations that it was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity, and rumour. This pressure to avoid negative news, and to offer reassurance, appears to have been felt by several professional scientific organisations in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been singled out by experts for straying from scientific evidence, appearing at worst politically motivated and at best overly optimistic. A letter from the Director General of the ICMR, Balram Bhargava, said that the ICMR envisaged launching a coronavirus vaccine on Aug 15 (Indian Independence Day; a deadline considered unrealistic by most medical experts); ICMR has supported treatment with hydroxychloroquine despite insufficient evidence; and news reports claim that data on coronavirus infection were removed from a scientific paper.Transparency of the data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, especially those underpinning the case fatality rate, has also been questioned, as detailed in a recent World Report. The Indian Government reports a case fatality rate of 1·8%, much lower than the reported rate in other countries, but it is difficult to know if the numbers are comparable.Hope is important, and recognising successes is vital, especially during a pandemic. But presenting the current situation in India with a too positive spin not only clouds reality but also hampers vital public health initiatives. Perpetuating unrealistic claims or failing to honestly report negative news creates uncertainty among the public and health-care professionals, discouraging people from taking preventive action or taking public health messages seriously. India has the expertise in medicine, public health, research, and manufacturing to lead the nation through the COVID-19 pandemic. To capitalise on these attributes, the country's leaders must respect scientific evidence, expert commentary, and academic freedom, and not provide false optimism.
COVID-19 testing in the UK/-/During the past week, the UK has seen an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases. With a second wave of infections approaching, there is a need to adequately respond with a robust test and trace system. However, neither the testing nor the tracing system currently in place is prepared for the substantial increase in demand for tests. As autumn begins, we face the co-occurrence of schools and universities reopening, people returning to work, and the approach of the influenza season.Children have now returned to school, where the risk of becoming ill increases. As soon as a child shows any symptoms that could indicate COVID-19, they are sent home from school. They are not allowed to return unless they have had a negative test or have isolated at home for 10 days, which also affects other members of their household. If they test positive, some schools send home so-called bubbles of children, which can include as many as 250 children.As many illnesses have symptoms that overlap with those of COVID-19, it is hard to distinguish the underlying cause. For example, symptoms indicative of influenza infection could be mistaken for COVID-19. With the influenza season approaching, it is likely that anyone displaying these symptoms will require a test to rule out COVID-19. Additional guidance is needed from health officials to help educate the public on when it is appropriate to get a test.With such uncertainty, it is understandable that there has been a huge surge in demand for tests. But the response by the UK Government is concerning. Many people have reported having to travel hundreds of miles to test centres because no tests or appointments have been offered locally. UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has admitted that tests will be rationed, with some groups being granted priority access. It is difficult to believe that the Government did not predict the possibility of this increase in demand when children returned to schools and people went back to work. Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace, claimed that the modelling used to advise the Government had not predicted such a steep increase in demand, and blamed SAGE for getting its predictions wrong. Nevertheless, demand for testing is up to 3 times higher than capacity—how has this scenario occurred?There does not seem to be a physical shortage of testing kits, more that they are not being distributed properly and it is difficult for people to get an appointment at one of the test centres. Also, laboratories processing the tests are limited in the number of tests they can do each day (375 000 tests per day) due to staffing and resources available. Although this number is much higher than back in March, Operation Moonshot, a Government pledge to reach 500 000 tests per day by the end of October, and 4 million by February next year, seems ambitious.Community testing is where the Government is falling short. According to a BBC report, nearly all community testing is processed in one of seven so-called Lighthouse Labs, which were close to capacity in August. Only one third of test results in community testing centres are returned within 24 h. If tests are not completed in a timely manner, results might not accurately reflect whether someone is infected.The situation can evolve rapidly, but it is not too late to prevent a repeat of earlier this year. Independent SAGE have released a 10-point emergency plan to avoid another national lockdown, to be implemented in this 2–3-week grace period before the situation worsens. They recommend a strategy to build a functional testing system: rebuild the testing system based on trusted local NHS and public health structures; recruit local contact tracers; provide clear, consistent, and culturally appropriate messaging about testing and effective measures; establish a clear strategy and set priorities for symptomatic and asymptomatic testing; and provide wrap around support, enabling people to self-isolate.Perhaps it is time to consider alternative methods of mass testing. Suggestions include using pooled saliva samples, which could allow for community testing at a lower financial cost. The COVID-19 symptom-tracker app from King's College London could also help track the spread of infection across the country. Testing should also be integrated through primary care to help triage patients in whom testing is necessary.Keeping the R number low is crucial to manage a second wave. But this number will be difficult to calculate, and inaccurate, without data on infection rates because of an inadequate testing system. Measures proposed by SAGE and Independent SAGE, if feasible, should be implemented as a matter of urgency. Otherwise the country could be forced into a lockdown by default.
COVID-19: a stress test for trust in science/-/Peer Review Week is the annual celebration of the importance of peer review, running Sept 21–25. The theme this year is trust in peer review, a particularly appropriate focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trust in research and its role in political decision making and policy changes have never been more at the forefront of public discussion and scrutiny than during the current public health crisis. But what is everyone's role in strengthening this trust?Peer review has a central role in scientific publishing. We are extremely grateful to our peer reviewers for their expertise, time, wisdom, and willingness to provide constructive criticism, helping us select papers to publish and assist authors in improving their manuscripts. Peer review is under-recognised as an essential academic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has made finding reviewers, and especially fulfilling our pledges on gender and geographical diversity, particularly challenging. Women have disproportionately taken on the burden of child and family care while working from home, with little additional time for non-essential academic tasks. Many health-care workers in low-income and middle-income countries are too overwhelmed with clinical duties to find time for research or peer review.Equally our editors, many of whom are women, have been coordinating our 21 journals under difficult circumstances while largely working from home for more than 6 months. In some cases, we have had five times as many submissions as usual, and have had to rapidly publish important work without compromising our usual quality checks or publication processes. We have encouraged and facilitated global medical conversations among the scientific community in our Comment and Correspondence sections, including research-based ideas, as a new way to advance understanding about COVID-19 as quickly as possible. Furthermore, we have attempted to ensure honest reporting of research findings, including to the press and general public.Science is a powerful and positive force in society; it shapes the present, and it guides our future. Politicians and policy makers rely on published research at critical moments of crises and emergency to guide their actions. And peer review remains essential to the scientific publishing process. It binds authors, editors, reviewers, and readers together, and helps to build trust between them.Retraction, although often thought of in negative terms, is also an important and necessary part of post-publication accountability, and quick, decisive action can preserve trust when it is imperilled. Even so, as editors, with a responsibility for the scientific record, we aim to learn whenever we can how we might reduce risks and improve processes and understanding, including around peer review. For one, we can do more to explain how journals function and what different types of published papers mean to a wider audience. COVID-19 has thrust many of the discussions around science publishing into the public domain in an unprecedented way. Articulating the importance of peer review—how it benefits science and society, and its achievements and its limitations—is essential to engendering trust.Therefore, to coincide with Peer Review Week 2020, we have created a new online resource for a broad audience to explain our editorial processes and policies. Additionally, we have illustrated the journey of a paper through our system as an infographic, outlining our different types of papers, such as Comments, Editorials, news items, and letters, and what can be concluded from them.Preprints have been subject to particularly polarised discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic, with both positive and negative aspects brought to light. Preprints enable researchers to disseminate important research quickly and accessibly so that others can build on their findings and perhaps collaborate. However, without peer review and editorial scrutiny, some findings might be entirely unreliable and even dangerous for public health. Overall, we believe that preprints are an important part of the move to open science and we will continue our offering of Preprints with The Lancet, stressing the importance of explaining their preliminary nature.This pandemic has had an enormous effect on collaborative, adaptive, and rapid research, rapid publication of important findings and scientific ideas, and public interest in and scrutiny of research and science. If we can continue to work together to strengthen research and trust in science with the ultimate goal of using the best science for better lives, then the pandemic could have an unexpected positive side-effect.
Global collaboration for health: rhetoric versus reality/-/The 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) opens on Sept 15, 2020. Being held remotely for the first time, the meeting will inevitably be dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but other issues on the agenda that have resonance for global health include the climate crisis, peace, disarmament, and humanitarian assistance. Underpinning this year's agenda is the UN theme of multilateralism, under the banner ”The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism”. Yet the meeting comes at a time when global collaboration and cooperation are in disarray.The UNGA is traditionally built on bold rhetoric of global collaboration and exhaustive debate over some of the world's most intractable problems. But rather than expressing a shared vision for a common future, countries are now undermining global cooperation through rising nationalism, open hostility towards multilateral institutions, and a growing tendency to look after their own interests—eg, rushing to secure supplies of potential COVID-19 vaccines. Health is precariously caught in the middle of these tensions. Science has become increasingly politicised, with multiple and conflicted interests at play, and often little sense of solidarity within or between nations.An immediate casualty of these opposing forces is the global effort towards vaccines for COVID-19. COVAX, the COVID-19 Global Access Facility, is led by WHO; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and aims to rapidly develop and equitably distribute effective vaccines. Variable commitment to COVAX reflects the tension between nationalism and collaboration. 170 countries plan to participate, but the USA, for one, is opting not to join COVAX. Instead, the USA has secured bilateral deals with several pharmaceutical companies for millions of doses of promising COVID-19 vaccines. Similar deals have been struck by Australia, the EU, and the UK. In July, Médecins Sans Frontières warned that “These bilateral deals will reduce the initial global vaccine stocks available for vulnerable groups in poorer countries and undermine global efforts to ensure fair allocation”.Insufficient collaboration is also jeopardising the Pan American Health Organization, with many member states, including Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico, withholding essential funding at a time when Latin America is under mounting pressure from COVID-19. Meanwhile, the USA continues its deeply disappointing withdrawal from WHO.The climate emergency is another subject on which rhetoric has fallen flat in the face of nationalistic inaction. The global response to COVID-19 depends heavily on the idea of creating a better future for human and planetary health, and commitment to this approach is non-negotiable for sustainable recovery. It is disappointing that the UNGA's formal general agenda does not more extensively cover climate change beyond the item “Protection of global climate for present and future generations of humankind”, although there is a Summit on Biodiversity on Sept 30, as well as activities across New York City.Hopefully, the summit will also return the UNGA's focus to the Sustainable Development Goals, which must still be met by 2030, and to defining a post-2020 biodiversity framework. An early indication that nations might work to protect health in the face of climate change as laid out in this year's WHO manifesto for a healthy and green recovery from COVID-19 is seen in the commitment to the Resilient Recovery Platform. Launched in Japan on Sept 3, 2020, the platform is a global sharing of policy and actions to address the response to COVID-19 coupled with the response to the climate emergency, with stakeholders such as governments, businesses, non-governmental organisations, and civil society. The participation of 80 countries shows a willingness to engage in overhauling socioeconomic models towards a sustainable future. But will it be translated into action?Global solidarity cannot be garnered through rhetoric alone. COVID-19 has brought into clear view that every person's health is interconnected, and the UNGA is a platform with the power to reorientate global interests in such a way as to protect the health and lives of all people in every nation. The need for global cooperation has never been more visible or more crucial. Unfortunately, the UN has so far in 2020 not been able to transform rhetoric into reality. This should give pause for serious reflection. Global crises call for global responses, and we have yet to see them.
Curing COVID-19/-/As the COVID-19 pandemic moves into its 10th month, greater patient survival suggests that treatment of severe disease has improved. How much of this improvement is due to better supportive care and how much to pharmaceuticals is a matter of debate. Given the huge effort that the biomedical community has put into finding drugs to treat COVID-19, with thousands of trials completed and ongoing, it's worth taking stock of the evidence for what has worked and what has not.The hunt for COVID-19 treatments has become extraordinarily politicised, and no more so than with the aminoquinoline drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Early observational studies suggested a beneficial effect of treatment with these cheap drugs, leading to acclamation by US President Trump. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in hospitalised patients have shown no effect of hydroxychloroquine in reducing mortality. One RCT hinted at an effect when used as post-exposure prophylaxis, but this was not statistically significant. Unless new, high-quality evidence emerges, the aminoquinolines appear to have no future in the management of COVID-19. Remdesivir, an antiviral, was also the subject of White House fanfare. The US Government has attempted to corner the market for this costly drug but results of clinical trials are ambiguous. One review concluded that remdesivir may reduce time to clinical improvement and decrease mortality but had no effect on need for invasive ventilation or length of hospital stay. A subsequent RCT found no effect on mortality. Although approved to treat COVID-19 in the USA and Europe, conclusive evidence to support remdesivir is lacking. For other antivirals, there is no good evidence for efficacy of favipiravir, although it has been approved in Russia, and the lopinavir/ritonavir combination showed no clinical benefit in the UK RECOVERY RCT.Immunomodulators to treat COVID-19 are being widely tested in clinical trials. Among the front-runners, evidence to support use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptors, comes largely from observational studies. Roche, the manufacturer, has announced that the drug did not improve clinical status in a phase 3 RCT among patients with severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Similarly, good quality evidence on the use of convalescent plasma is still awaited. Large RCTs such as RECOVERY, which includes tocilizumab and convalescent plasma groups, should provide answers. Immunomodulators that do work are the corticosteroids. In the dexamethasone group of RECOVERY, deaths were reduced by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% among those receiving oxygen only compared with those in the standard care group. An RCT of dexamethasone done in Brazil further supports the beneficial effect of the drug. The REMAP-CAP RCT of hydrocortisone—another corticosteroid—versus placebo in patients with severe COVID-19 showed a 93% improvement in the intervention group in days when organ support was not needed. Based on these findings, WHO guidelines recommend corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical COVID-19.Is targeted treatment reducing deaths as the disease continues to sweep around the world? Where there has been a resurgence of COVID-19 cases to levels at least as high as when the pandemic first struck in the spring, such as in the USA, France, and Spain, it has not been followed by a comparable increase in deaths, nor of people requiring admission to hospital. Thus, treatment alone cannot be responsible for saving lives. Possible explanations for the recent disparity in cases and deaths include more widespread testing, meaning that the number of cases being detected is closer to the true burden of infection, whereas the accuracy of counting deaths remains unchanged; lower viral load at the point of transmission, and hence less severe disease, because of non-pharmaceutical measures such as mask wearing; and changes in the distribution of cases towards younger age groups. Data from England show that until recently cases have been fairly evenly distributed across all ages from 20 years upwards, but by the last 2 weeks of August cases in people aged 20–39 were about ten times the number in those aged 70 or more. Risk of COVID-19 death in young people is tiny compared with the elderly. However, cases in the young might yet spill over into older people, and the long-term consequences of non-fatal disease are unknown.Whatever the reasons for apparent declining mortality, the impact of drug treatments on the COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. The massive research effort needs to bear fruit with a broader range of effective therapies.
COVID-19: a new lens for non-communicable diseases/-/On Sept 19, 2011, global leaders met at the UN in New York, USA, to set an international agenda on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which cause three-quarters of global deaths. This was only the second time in history that the UN General Assembly had met to discuss a health issue (the first was for HIV/AIDS in 2001). In 2015, Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 set the ambitious target for countries to reduce their risk of premature mortality from NCDs by a third relative to 2015 levels by 2030. The Lancet NCD Countdown 2030, published on Sept 3, reveals that, among high-income countries, only Denmark, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, and South Korea are on track to meet this target for both men and women if they maintain or surpass their 2010–16 average rates of decline. We know how to reduce the risk of NCDs—for the most part through a combination of effective tobacco and alcohol control, and well understood health interventions for hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. But addressing the broader determinants of NCDs is difficult without more robust fiscal measures. Although NCDs have received plenty of political attention, action has clearly been inadequate.A modelling study published in The Lancet Global Health suggests that, worldwide, one in five people are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 should they become infected, mostly as a result of underlying NCDs. The enormous efforts to deal with COVID-19 have also disrupted the regular care often required by patients with NCDs. WHO completed a rapid assessment survey in May, 2020, and found that 75% of countries reported interruptions to NCD services. Among the most hard hit were public health campaigns and NCD surveillance efforts. Excess deaths from the disruption caused by COVID-19 might make any gains against the virus a pyrrhic victory. COVID-19 and NCDs form a dangerous relationship, experienced as a syndemic that is exacerbating social and economic inequalities. The Lancet NCDI Poverty Commission: bridging a gap in universal health care for the poorest billion, will be published later this month and will explore the relation between poverty and NCDs in more detail. COVID-19 also provides a new lens through which to view NCDs.During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have seen the value of stronger tobacco and alcohol controls, an important step towards reducing NCDs. But others have struggled to balance public health measures against predatory commerce and economic recovery. Botswana, India, Russia, South Africa, and Spain have all restricted tobacco products during the pandemic. But the tactics of Big Tobacco have been at play: on Aug 17, South Africa lifted its ban after two legal challenges from the tobacco industry.There have been national responses to safeguard and improve nutrition. Initially, in Costa Rica, the government kept school canteens open amid school closures, but later decided to distribute food baskets containing fresh and perishable food to families. In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson found new energy to tackle obesity after his own experience of COVID-19. But in total opposition to this plan, in August, the UK launched a scheme to encourage people to eat in restaurants and fast-food outlets in order to help businesses. Dubai loosened laws governing alcohol sales to encourage the economy. For many people, lockdowns exacerbated an obesogenic environment in which access to nutritious food and physical activity were made more difficult.COVID-19 is a pandemic that must highlight the high burden that NCDs place on health resources. It should act as a catalyst for governments to implement stricter tobacco, alcohol, and sugar controls, as well as focused investment in improving physical activity and healthy diets. COVID-19 has shown that many of the tools required for fighting a pandemic are also those required to fight NCDs: disease surveillance, a strong civil society, robust public health, clear communication, and equitable access to resilient universal health-care systems. COVID-19 could provide new insights into interactions between the immune system and NCDs, and potentially change the way we understand and treat these diseases. It might also generate new long-term disabilities that will add to the NCD burden. 2020 has shown the crucial relation between communicable diseases and NCDs. Both inflict an unacceptable toll on human life. COVID-19 must stimulate far greater political action to overcome inertia around NCDs.This online publication has been corrected.

Understanding the long-term health effects of COVID-19/-/6 months after WHO declared it a pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is still spreading worldwide, and COVID-19 disease has had an overwhelming impact on public health and the global economy. With more than 31 million cases reported worldwide as of Sept 21st, 2020, the number of recovered patients with persisting symptoms and unexpected sequelae is increasing. Previous outbreaks of Spanish influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Ebola have shown that survivors can suffer from long-term complications. However, research is still required to determine the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2.Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs, it has been found to damage the vascular endothelium of several other organs, resulting in complaints such as brain fog, palpitations, and fatigue, among others. The extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are varied, and the heart, brain, and kidneys are particularly susceptible to damage. This vascular component of COVID-19 might help to explain why certain patients still struggle with severe symptoms months after clearing the viral infection.Cardiovascular disease was shown to play an important role in COVID-19 pathology early in the pandemic. Myocardial inflammation after recovery from COVID-19, even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, has been reported. Furthermore, a study by Marc Dweck and colleagues (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK), published in the European Heart Journal—Cardiovascular Imaging in June, 2020, revealed that 55% of 1216 patients with COVID-19 had an abnormal echocardiogram, with evidence of left and right ventricular abnormalities, and myocardial infarction. An abnormal echocardiograph was also observed in 314 of 581 children with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated with COVID-19, as reported in a systematic review by Mubbasheer Ahmed and colleagues (Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA), published in EClinicalMedicine in September, 2020. A study by Valentina Puntmann and colleagues (University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany), published in JAMA Cardiology in July, 2020, suggests that there is a possibility of residual left ventricular dysfunction and ongoing inflammation months after a COVID-19 diagnosis, which might progress to heart failure and other cardiovascular complications. Additionally, by damaging the endothelium, COVID-19 might result in abnormal blood clotting, with estimates suggesting that up to 30% of people with severe COVID-19 develop blood clots. It is unclear how long the prothrombotic environment persists in recovered patients, but in the July, 2020, issue of EClinicalMedicine, Amy Rapkiewicz and colleagues (Long Island School of Medicine, Mineola, NY, USA) showed blood clots to affect multiple organs.Evidence for the various neurological presentations associated with COVID-19 is increasing. A study by Yiping Lu and colleagues (Fudan University, Fudan, China), published in the August, 2020, issue of EClinicalMedicine, investigated cerebral microstructural changes in recovered COVID-19 patients 3 months after infection using MRI. Neurological symptoms, such as mood change, fatigue, headache, and visual disturbance, were present in 55% of the 60 recovered patients who had COVID-19. Furthermore, significant disruption to microstructural and functional brain integrity was observed. Other studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to cause thrombotic vascular events, including stroke, than other coronaviruses and the seasonal influenza. Additionally, acute neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19. However, because SARS-COV-2 can penetrate the brain and cause direct damage to neuronal networks, patients might experience long-term neuropsychiatric complications, which might be exacerbated by the distress caused by the infection.Renal involvement is frequent in COVID-19, and the clinical presentation ranges from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury. SARS-CoV-2 might attack the kidneys directly, but the kidneys are also vulnerable to the uncontrolled inflammation and blood clots that are caused by the virus. The International Society of Nephrology reported that kidney abnormalities are observed in 25–50% of patients with severe COVID-19 who require hospitalisation. The number of patients who will go on to develop chronic kidney disease is currently unknown; however, a significant number might require dialysis or transplantation.To improve our understanding of the long-term health effects of COVID-19, large-scale standardised data collection is vital. Follow-up studies of people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are currently being initiated. In the UK, the Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study, a collaboration involving 20 universities and associated National Health Service trusts, aims to follow-up 10 000 patients for 1 year to assess the impact of COVID-19 on patient recovery and health. Similar studies are also ongoing in the USA, such as the University of California, San Francisco COVID-19 (LIINC) study led by Steven Deeks, which plans to recruit 300 patients for 2 years of follow-up. Furthermore, post-mortem studies might further illuminate the complex pathological processes underlying long-term organ damage.With millions of recovered patients potentially experiencing damage to their blood vessels, health-care systems worldwide need to develop ways of supporting people recovering from COVID-19 to avoid further straining health resources. Dedicated rehabilitation centres for people recovering from COVID-19 need to be made available to ensure people have the best recovery, resume their daily activities as quickly as possible, and decrease socioeconomic repercussions. However, the extent to which persisting symptoms will affect health systems and the labour force remains unknown.Because the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the vasculature is so profound, and blood vessels interact with every organ in the body, cross-disciplinary collaborations might be required to develop effective treatment strategies. Knowledge of the vascular consequences of the disease might allow physicians to intervene early, or to alter treatment strategies, and it might be possible to prevent long-term damage.
Air travel in the time of COVID-19/-/The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way we think about travelling. Most countries in the world have adopted some measure of lockdown or restriction to movement to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ease the burden of admissions in struggling health systems. These measures have raised questions about the safety of travelling for work and leisure, and current recommendations discourage unnecessary travel. Although the risk of contracting an infectious disease when travelling has always existed, the COVID-19 pandemic has made travellers more aware of this possibility.However, with the relaxing of lockdown measures in some countries in light of reductions in the number of COVID-19 cases and the holiday season in the northern hemisphere, many people are facing the dilemma of choosing to travel after months of restrictions or to remain at home for fear of being confined in an aeroplane for hours with other people. Considerations include where it is safe to go, what is the risk of travelling, and what new measures are in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for those who decide to travel.Many countries have introduced border closures to prevent the arrival of infected travellers from countries where there is continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in order to protect progress made in the control of the pandemic. Global surveillance of the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is a key element to inform governments around border closures, which is a decision with heavy implications for the economy, especially for countries that rely on tourism as a source of income. In many cases, instead of full border closure, quarantine is required for any traveller coming from countries where COVID-19 is rife. These measures are dynamically applied depending on changes in the epidemiological situation: an extreme example was quarantine for passengers on a flight from Nice to Oslo because they landed 1 min after Norway had declared France a high-risk country. Some countries are instead introducing travel bubbles, also known as coronavirus corridors, which allow the opening of borders with specific countries they deem safe while maintaining more rigid restrictions for the rest of the world.Beyond what countries decide, individuals still need to balance benefits and risks of the decision to travel, and with most cruise ships not operating at the moment, the focus for international travellers is on flying. The very idea of being in close proximity to strangers with an unknown infection status for hours is understandably a concern, although cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on aeroplanes have been very few so far. After the emergence of COVID-19, airlines and airports introduced new rules and measures to minimise the chances of infection with SARS-CoV-2: wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes, expanded cleaning of public spaces to reduce the presence of the virus on inanimate surfaces, physical distancing (at least 2 m), and hand sanitising. Some airlines have reduced the number of passengers allowed on a flight to guarantee more distance between travellers or they have cancelled food and drink sales during the flights. Despite concerns about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through air ventilation, aeroplanes benefit from air-conditioning systems with far more sophisticated and effective filters than those generally found on the ground. The high efficiency particulate air filters used on aeroplanes have been found to remove almost all particles of the typical size of coronavirus.What does the future hold for travellers? The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine will be instrumental in reinstating confidence in travellers. However, it is expected that many airlines will cut services such as meals, drinks, and free magazines, not so much for economic reasons but as a way to limit so-called touchpoints, which are opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission via close physical proximity between flyers and crew. Rapid testing for COVID-19 for both crew members and passengers could become a regular feature. Enhanced cleanliness and sanitisation will become the norm. Use of masks or other protective equipment will become more common. Touchless technology will reduce human interaction and facilitate payments and processes linked to travelling.Following the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, travellers adapted to enhanced security controls in airports and strict rules regarding their luggage. The COVID-19 pandemic may similarly redefine what is normal for travellers, with a potentially positive outcome of reducing the risk of transmission of many other infections besides COVID-19.
Water and sanitation in a post-COVID world/-/Like many such events, this year's World Water Week (Aug 24–28) conference will now be taking place virtually. Convened by the Stockholm International Water Institute, the meeting gathers scientists, business leaders, and policy makers, as well as civil society, to engage on one of the world's most pressing set of challenges.It was only just over a decade ago, on July 28, 2010, that the UN General Assembly recognised the human right to water and sanitation, through Resolution 64/292, entitling everyone to acceptable, accessible, affordable, safe, and sufficient water. And in 2015, the global community set a measurable target in the form of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which committed countries to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Where does the world stand now regarding these rights and targets?According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 2000–2017 report, published in 2019, 1·8 billion people gained access to at least basic services between 2000 and 2017. However, in 2017, 2·2 billion people still lacked access to safely managed drinking water, 4·2 billion lacked safely managed sanitation, and 3 billion lacked basic handwashing services. Furthermore, the Programme's WASH in Health Care Facilities global baseline report 2019 showed that one in eight health-care facilities had no water service and one in five had no sanitation service in 2016. The consequences of these inadequacies for infection prevention and control amid a pandemic are clear.As ever, such global figures mask regional inequities and data gaps. In a geostatistical modelling study of 88 low-income and middle-income countries in this month's issue, Anriuddha Deshpande and colleagues show that access to piped water was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa in 2017 and relatively high in Latin America. Deshpande and colleagues also estimate the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years that could be attributed to unsafe facilities and found that, in 2017 in sub-Saharan Africa, 143 300 deaths in children were attributable to unsafe water, and 18 100 child deaths were avoided by increased access to safe water. In southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, 9470 child deaths were attributable to unsafe water and increases in safe water avoided at least 1310 child deaths. The authors acknowledge the limitations of this work, including insufficient data to produce reliable estimates.What we do know is that, during the last century, use of water globally has been growing at more than twice the rate of population growth. Supplies of water are threatened by climate change, population growth, demographic changes, and urbanisation. In recent years, an increasing number of cities have come close to or reached the limits at which they can sustainably supply water services. In January 2018, the announcement that Cape Town was three months away from “Day Zero” (the date when the municipal water supply would be cut off) made headlines around the world—a fate that the city thankfully managed to avoid. Before that, in 2015, São Paulo came within 20 days of its own “Day Zero” and in June 2019, Chennai's main reservoirs ran completely dry. This is a cross-continental trio of reminders that the challenge of achieving water security is here to stay.Yet could the COVID-19 pandemic mark a step change in the urgency with which the international community addresses these challenges? In a Comment published in this month's issue, Adeladza Amegah notes the “tremendous” improvement in access to handwashing facilities in many African countries, with “handwashing stations noticeably increasing in community centres, schools, markets, bus terminals, lorry stations, and other public spaces”. Moreover, “some African governments, as part of their COVID-19 response plans, took urgent steps to make clean water accessible to all communities by drilling boreholes and mobilising water tankers to supply water.” He urges national and local governments to find the fiscal space to continue these practices and sustain the promotion of handwashing post-COVID.
COVID-19 and haematology-oncology services/-/As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, the situation for patients with haematological malignancies is also evolving. With the effects on health-care systems still being felt, and the enormous global research effort to uncover the biological mechanisms of COVID-19, an expert consensus for how to treat patients with cancer during the pandemic was published last month by the European Society of Medical Oncology. Key recommendations include the need to test patients regularly for the virus, and to proceed with treatments as much as possible, taking the local infection rate into consideration. The recommendations also note that face-to-face consultations should be used for key appointments, such as during diagnosis.The recommendation for face-to-face consultations for the delivery of key information contrasts with the rapid move towards the use of telemedicine, which is the safest option for patients and health-care workers to prevent the spread of the virus. Many aspects of health care can be delivered with telemedicine, such as prescribing oral medication already part of a treatment plan; however, the value of face-to-face consultations should not be underestimated, especially for initial diagnoses and for the management of complex treatments, such as haematopoietic stem-cell transplantations.Delays in diagnoses are a concern; two modelling studies published in The Lancet Oncology provide predictions for the UK, with over 3000 additional deaths estimated within 5 years because of diagnostic delays. The situation could be further complicated by the possibility of some symptoms of haematological malignancies being mistaken for those of COVID-19. Ensuring that risks and benefits for patients with haematological malignancies are balanced in terms of protection from the virus and providing timely diagnosis and treatment will be essential as the pandemic continues to develop.
Will the COVID-19 pandemic threaten the SDGs?/-/The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, provide an international framework to move by 2030 toward more equitable, peaceful, resilient, and prosperous societies—while living within sustainable planetary boundaries. As the UN celebrates its 75th anniversary and a third of the SDG timeline has passed, The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020—prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in collaboration with experts and international agencies— tells a story of tentative but insufficient progress, and warns of the regressive impact of the coronavirus pandemic.According to the report, COVID-19 threatens to reverse the progress of SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and wellbeing for all. During the crisis, 70 countries have halted childhood vaccination programmes, and in many places, health services for cancer screening, family planning, or non-COVID-19 infectious diseases have been interrupted or are being neglected. Health service disruptions could reverse decades of improvement, warns the report. Allowing people to slip through these service gaps could affect population health for years to come.Even before COVID-19 the world was off track to end poverty by 2030 under SDG 1, with projections suggesting that 6% of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030. Now, an estimated 71 million additional people could be living in extreme poverty due to COVID-19. Although income inequality has been falling in some countries, a global economic recession in the wake of the pandemic could push millions back into poverty and exacerbate inequalities. The most susceptible groups are being hit hardest by the pandemic, threatening SDG 10. Similarly, the ambition under SDG 2 to end hunger was faltering before COVID-19—the population affected by food insecurity had risen between 2014 and 2018—but the COVID-19 crisis has added to pressure on production, supply chains, and household incomes, with the poorest being most affected. Access to water and sanitation (SDG 6) remains a major health issue. 2·2 billion people remain without safe drinking water and the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted lack of access to sanitation for billions.Tackling global poverty and water and food scarcity is intrinsically linked to mitigating climate and land-use change. However, as the SDGs report shows, the world is off track to meet the goals toward environmental sustainability encompassed by SDGs 7–9 and 11–15. Most countries are not meeting their commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions. We are in danger of missing targets to improve urban environments by reducing the number of people living in slums, increasing access to public transport, and reducing air pollution. Aims towards sustainable and inclusive economic growth, energy provision, and infrastructure development had all been falling short before COVID-19 and face considerable setbacks in the shadow of an economic recession.The aim of SDG 4—to achieve inclusive and equitable access to education—also looks likely to be missed, with a projection that more than 200 million children will still be out of education by 2030. Most of the world's children have been deprived of formal education during the COVID-19 outbreak—a legacy that could threaten the SDGs' underlying ambition to leave no one behind. The world has made progress on SDG 5's gender equality goals, with fewer girls being forced into early marriage and more women entering leadership roles. However, women's wellbeing has suffered during the COVID-19 outbreak, with incidences of domestic violence increasing by 30% in some countries and a greater demand on women for unpaid care work.Finally, reaching the SDGs will be impossible without international cooperation. The political tensions stoked by COVID-19 and a trend toward hardening of national borders could threaten SDG 16 to promote peace and safety from violence and SDG 17 to strengthen international partnerships.
Walking forwards, looking backwards/-/Scanning back over news headlines from this year throws up a lot of references to events being unprecedented and unexpected and to many societal responses as being relatively underprepared, unplanned, or poorly tested, especially where multiple stressors overlap. Indeed, if we lacked useful and meaningful foresight and could only learn from past experience, then that would be our inevitable predicament. 2020 has been remarkable in many respects to the extent that even listing the examples would take up most of the available space for this editorial. To name just a few, we are still embroiled in a pandemic, as if we could forget, the global nature of which makes almost every other event a compound one. The year opened with the tail end of the worst Australian wildfire season in documented history: a situation that had huge consequences for Australian ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health and wellbeing from smoke inhalation to post-traumatic stress and other mental health challenges. We are experiencing among the hottest average global temperatures on record, which is fuelling regional heatwaves and some of the highest temperature ever recorded on earth. Greenland is losing record volumes of ice contributing to sea level rise. Around a third of Bangladesh has recently been affected by flooding, the fifth time floods like this have affected the region in the past 20 years. Until recently, floods of this scale were thought to be one in 20-year events. The combination of monsoon flooding and COVID-19 in the wake of super-cyclone Amphan seems particularly brutal and certainly represents a deeply challenging confluence of events for any country to manage. These events make Bangladesh an unfortunate posterchild for climate injustice, having contributed little to the greenhouse gas emissions causing the climate crisis but bearing the brunt of many of the worst impacts. Rich countries may be relatively less affected, but they are far from safe from climate change impacts, and the California wildfire season is testimony to this vulnerability. The amount of land burned in a single week in August, 2020, was more than the total burned in 2018, and double that of 2017.What all of these events have in common is that they are entirely expected based on longstanding scientific understanding. Of course, the exact timing was not predictable in each case, but the likelihood of occurrence has been predicted and even the risk of some compound events has a level of predictability. A global pandemic has been warned about for decades, not least because we have experienced them before and because modern city living, and international trade and travel, are much more conducive to disease spread. Furthermore, in recent decades multiple emerging infectious diseases have avoided pandemic scale primarily because we were lucky. Expanding agriculture and habitat erosion has further accentuated the likelihood of zoonotic disease emergence. None of this should be a surprise to anyone who takes scientific knowledge seriously. The climate emergency has been predicted with remarkable consistency for decades and many impacts like wildfire and coastal flooding are equally well established. Hindsight is 20:20, but even accounting for that effect, we haven't seen anything this year that wasn't reasonably predictable. Why then were we so ill prepared? There are amany reasons from political lobbying and disinformation campaigns, to locked in economic and political structures which favour certain types of value and extreme short-termism. Combined these seem to make long-term planning, and investment outside of existing norms politically and economically inconceivable. Additionally, we seem habitually locked into looking backwards for context. Learning from the past is obviously important, but in a rapidly changing world that just isn't a complete approach to decision making. These events are mostly reported as unusual in the context of the past, but in 15 to 20 years from now we are likely to be referring to 2020 as relatively cool rather than hot. Naturally there are many examples of success and impressive work in the face of these challenges, but from a big picture perspective it is hard not to judge our responses as too reactive and knee jerk, embarrassingly so. If we are to do better, we need a much more forward looking and integrated and flexible approach to the future which utilises the wealth of knowledge we have, rather than waiting for predictions to come to fruition before rising to tackle them.
Transparency during global health emergencies/-/Medical research and publishing communities have been admonished for the lack of transparency in the reporting of COVID-19 data, exemplified by two recent retractions of COVID-19 papers published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. These studies reported proprietary data from electronic health records allegedly obtained from hundreds of hospitals around the world by the company, Surgisphere. Post-publication analysis of these papers revealed multiple inconsistencies in the data and questions about the provenance of the data sources. When these concerns were put to the authors of the papers, it was revealed that the data could not be shared with the public nor an independent auditor, and so the veracity of these data could not be guaranteed.The Surgisphere misconduct case resulted in the loss of precious resources and time during a critical global emergency. The case also brought into sharp focus the desperate need to accelerate efforts for greater data oversight and transparency in medical research. Disclosure of raw data can protect against potential misconduct. More importantly, as Cosgriff and colleagues highlight, data sharing will enhance global collaboration and will promote real-time analysis for improved control of future outbreaks like COVID-19. So why is COVID-19 data not being shared with medical researchers?Although data sharing is seen as an ethical and moral obligation for many researchers, Cosgriff and colleagues suggest that the main obstacles to data sharing are not so much the availability of technology or infrastructure, but the cultural and systemic challenges, such as pressures of “publish-or-perish” academia and data monetisation. In the USA, patient-level data are considered proprietary to the institution collecting it, not the scientific community nor the patients themselves. However, protection of proprietary interest in the ownership of data is thought to encourage further research and to mitigate concerns over misinterpretation of data.Komorowski and colleagues discuss the challenges in sharing patient-level data, especially across geographical borders, highlighting issues of individual consent and anonymity assurance. A major deterrent to multinational data sharing is strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy. These requirements have been a particular issue of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, regarding the use of digital tools and mobile phone data for contact tracing. A Comment published in The Lancet Digital Health showed that, despite the benefits of big data in health care, there is substantial concern among the public regarding the growing commodification of patient data and the risks involved in data sharing. The authors indicate that the COVID-19 crisis could impose new risks to the public's data privacy and security. In response, they call for public standards that secure regulation and transparency of data use and sharing and that support patient understanding of the data they provide.Despite these challenges, open databases for COVID-19 research are available. For example, the Open COVID-19 Data Curation Group have released an international, deidentified, real-time dataset at the patient level. Furthermore, the pandemic has prompted a new and more urgent interest in sharing existing data, and in pooling resources as open data repositories receive an increase in submissions. To combat concerns regarding the erosion of ethics review and informed consent during emergencies, on Jan 28, 2020, before the WHO announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics issued a Call for Action for a more ethical and collaborative approach to sharing data and doing research. The report highlights that during global emergencies, National Research Ethics Committees should lead on decisions about whether data can be stored and shared; and how to involve patient communities in these decisions.The Nuffield report emphasises the role of journals as “duty-bearers” to support ethical research during emergencies. The Lancet Digital Health editors agree and, as such, all of our publications must adhere to basic principles of data sharing and reporting. Integrity of data and patient privacy are the most important considerations that underlie the success of a research paper. If privacy issues prevent the readers or reviewers from accessing the data underlying a paper's results, the authors must endeavour to validate their conclusions with data that are accessible to readers, so that analyses can be reproduced.The medical community must work towards rebuilding trust in science. The Lancet journals will continue to hold authors and editors accountable for the data published in our pages, and we encourage our readers to do the same.
Setting sights and giving thanks/-/This issue of The Lancet Rheumatology marks our first anniversary of publication, an occasion on which we are tempted to look back and celebrate the successes and achievements of the journal's inaugural year. But we shall resist this urge in favour of looking forward. In many ways, the situation for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases is potentially worse today than it was a year ago. There is much work to be done.The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities and has magnified pre-existing health-care inequities across the globe. It has also threatened to undo many of the recent gains in the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases, leaving patients bereft of the routine clinical guidance and disease management they depend on to control their otherwise debilitating diseases. For many, this has meant increased pain, decreased function, irreversible joint damage, and substantially reduced quality of life. For others, diagnoses have been delayed by clinic closures and cancellations, decreasing the odds of achieving disease remission. And the hype over use of mainstay rheumatology drugs such as hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 has engendered substantial anxiety and fear over access to and safety of these drugs among patients who depend on them on a daily (and long-term) basis.Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, huge inequities remain in patient access to specialty care and state-of-the-art therapies, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Musculoskeletal diseases remain among the top contributors to global disability, accounting for 139 000 disability-adjusted life years in 2017, with negligible improvement since 2007. And these diseases are not confined to the elderly; an estimated 3 million children and adolescents worldwide are living with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or clubfoot alone, mostly in Asia and Africa—limited resource areas where rheumatology specialists are sparse and access to targeted therapies is mostly cost prohibitive. Indeed, children and adolescents with arthritis in countries with lower GDP are reported to have greater disease activity and damage, often associated with delayed referrals.In the coming year, increased focus and resource allocation is urgently needed to begin to reverse the concerning trends in health-care inequities between resource-replete and resource-poor countries, and to improve access to specialty care for the most vulnerable patient populations. To this end, improvements prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic—in research efficiency, multidisciplinary collaboration, streamlined service provision, technology, and telemedicine—should, and must, be leveraged to improve patient care, strengthen health systems, increase awareness, and better understand the global burden of musculoskeletal diseases, particularly in LMICs. It is also imperative that we learn from successes and failures in the response to COVID-19, both to improve preparedness for future pandemics and to minimise the collateral health and economic damage caused by efforts to mitigate transmission of novel pathogens.Journals have an important part to play in these efforts. The timely dissemination of high-quality data has perhaps never seemed more critical or been more challenging than during the COVID-19 crisis. As noted by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, “We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic,” referring to the widespread dissemination of poor-quality data and misinformation around COVID-19. Many journals, including most of the Lancet family titles, have seen a huge increase in submissions, substantially increasing the demands on editors and peer reviewers. As such, we must continue to work toward improving and streamlining our editorial and peer review processes going forward, making sure to do so in ways that uphold the highest standards of quality and scientific rigor.Although our sights are firmly directed forward, we would be remiss not to mark this occasion by thanking the many contributors to the journal over the past year, including authors, advisors, readers, statisticians, and clinical peer reviewers, who have served our nascent journal tirelessly and helped us to sow the early seeds of success. Peer review of our content has involved 370 researchers and clinicians, a remarkable 83% of whom have never declined a review invitation; 18 individuals have reviewed 5 or more times in the past year. We are grateful for your service, guidance, passion, and vision, and for allowing us to act as ambassadors of your work and the rheumatology community.
Trump versus Biden: a fight for the health of a nation/-/With only 73 days until Nov 3, the 2020 presidential election in the US has entered a decisive phase with Democratic candidate Joe Biden's announcement of California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. It comes against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that has revealed a nation of stark inequity, especially in terms of health. Over the past three decades, non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease have been the predominant causes of death and disability in the US. High blood pressure, high body-mass index, and smoking have ranked among the top risk factors for poor health since 1990. Yet this bleak picture of US health has been considered in previous elections mainly as it relates to access to health care.The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) codified a set of ten essential health benefits that insurance plans must provide, including preventive health services, pregnancy and maternity care, and mental health services. Importantly, the ACA also eliminated pre-existing condition bans. The law aimed to greatly increase the number of those insured in the US through a mix of Government-provided insurance, such as Medicaid, and private insurance with employer and state-run health-care market places. A recently published 2020 Commonwealth Fund report shows that before the major provisions of the ACA were introduced, the US had worse outcomes and spent more on health care than after, but also had the lowest life expectancy, highest suicide rate (13·9 per 100 000 population, compared with an OECD average of 11·5), and the highest rate of avoidable deaths of all OECD countries. The US also has the highest chronic disease burden and an obesity rate of 40%, which is twice as high as the OECD average.In 2017, the number of uninsured people increased for the first time since implementation of the ACA—to 27·4 million people. Those most at risk of being uninsured include persons with low incomes and people of colour. Because coverage is still associated with the ability to pay, the cost of coverage continues to be the most commonly cited barrier to accessing care. Over half of Americans are insured through their employers and the massive loss of jobs because of COVID-19 has led to millions more Americans becoming uninsured. Biden has called for strengthening and expanding the ACA, but there is little incentive in Congress to move towards a single-provider health-care system. The US must move away from a system in which health care is politicised, contentious, and tied to employment, income, and immigration status. In addition, President Trump's isolationist and anti-scientific adminstration has de-prioritised health and health care.Decisions made by the next administration will affect the lives of all people in the US and around the world. For this reason, we invite both political parties to articulate their positions on the following urgent priorities.COVID-19. In light of the devastating effects of this pandemic, accentuated by the pre-existing epidemics of chronic disease, will you commit to enact truly universal health coverage to protect the health and wellbeing of the American people? If so, how?Health inequalities. Given the growing and disfiguring health disparities across the country, combined with burgeoning levels of racial and gender injustice, will you commit to making the reduction of health inequalities, and the social determinants of those inequalities, one of your major domestic objectives? If so, what specific actions will you take?Public health. Given the critical importance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to domestic health and global health security, will you commit to investing in and strengthening this vital national public health agency? If so, by how much?Global health. Given the importance of the international leadership role of the US in health and medicine, will you commit to returning as a fully participating member of multilateral health institutions, such as WHO?Medical research. Will you commit to accelerating funding for medical and public health research? The current President's budget proposal for 2021, called for a 7% cut in National Institutes of Health (NIH) spending. Do you agree that a strong research base is a powerful means to ensure the long-term health of the nation? If so, how much will you commit to invest in NIH?If logic and justice prevail in the next presidential administration, universal health coverage, a fairer society, stronger health institutions, more energetic global engagement, and a robust research agenda will be the foundations for America's renewal. We all have a stake in America's success.
Humanitarian crises in a global pandemic/-/On Aug 19, the world will mark a UN World Humanitarian Day very different from any other. But while COVID-19 captures the world's focus, other humanitarian crises also need attention, as evidenced most recently by the tragic aftermath of the explosion in Beirut.Even before COVID-19, 2020 was going to be a year marked by humanitarian need. Mark Lowcock, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), predicted that in 2020 “168 million people worldwide will need humanitarian assistance and protection. That represents about one person in 45 on the planet. It is the highest figure in decades.” Conflict in Yemen, Syria, DR Congo, the Sahel, and elsewhere is driving food shortages and displacement of people—the UN estimated that 80% of Yemenis require urgent humanitarian aid. Deepening economic crises, such as in Venezuela, are causing hunger and mass migration, and climate change is increasing the risk of natural disasters, famine, and drought. There were 79·5 million forcibly displaced people by the end of 2019, and access to health care is often poor in these settings; 80% of all refugees live in low-income and middle-income countries with weak health systems.COVID-19 is exacerbating the inequalities faced by individuals and families in humanitarian crises. With national governments looking inwards and putting their own citizens first, people in need of humanitarian assistance are being neglected.As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, governments worldwide have introduced travel restrictions, inadver tently stopping aid workers from travelling, and thereby hampering humanitarian responses. In some cases, aid workers already in-country cannot deliver vital services because of government restrictions aimed at protecting their own citizens. In Greece, asylum seekers and migrants are still under strict lockdown regulations as the rest of the country returns to normality, limiting their access to basic services. Globally, the risk of starvation in some camps because of a lack of access to aid constitutes a bigger threat than the virus itself, according to Amnesty International.An interruption of aid means even less access to soap and water, which is important for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Other non-pharmaceutical interventions—physical distancing and avoiding crowds and indoor spaces—are unsuitable in many humanitarian settings. Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, for example, has a population density of 40 000 people per km2, 40 times more than the country as a whole. Isolating confirmed cases is extremely difficult under these circumstances, and personal protective equipment is often difficult to obtain because countries have introduced export restrictions.Governments are also using the pandemic as an excuse to advance anti-migrant agendas under the flimsy pretext of protecting their citizens from COVID-19. The USA suspended asylum and large swaths of the immigration programme, despite having the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world. Since March 20, the Trump administration has turned back more than 20 000 migrants at the US border, which is a violation of domestic and international legal obligations. In Bosnia, local authorities cut off the water supply to migrant populations to force them to move on.Humanitarian organisations are responding, and the pandemic is giving them a chance to develop new ways of working. Whether moving to offering more services remotely, giving patients more medicines at a time to minimise contact, or using their experiences to develop tailored local responses, these organisations will keep trying to better serve people in humanitarian crises. But they cannot succeed unsupported.UNOCHA suggests that the global COVID-19 humanitarian response plan will cost US$10·3 billion, but only 20% has so far been pledged. By contrast, in just 2 months, governments spent $10 trillion on economic stimuli for their own economies. COVID-19 will worsen health burdens in humanitarian settings, and international disputes over resources have left people in these settings without support. This is nonsensical. If nothing else, COVID-19 is likely to persist in humanitarian settings where health care is poor even if the rest of the world moves on, constantly risking another outbreak.As states find themselves consumed with their own more immediate problems, they must remember that other humanitarian crises around the world have not diminished, and that the inequality exacerbated by COVID-19 is not resolved by myopically focusing on local problems. True concern for inequality demands attention to all the world's humanitarian needs.
The EVALI outbreak and vaping in the COVID-19 era/-/In August, 2019, the first case of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury) was reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The number of cases peaked in Sept, 2019, and as of Feb 18, 2020, 2807 EVALI cases had been reported with 68 deaths. Owing to the declining incidence of EVALI cases and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC updates were stopped in February. However, more recently, concerns have been raised about the convergence of vaping, and its effects, with COVID-19 infection—especially in young people.One of the main causes of the EVALI outbreak is thought to be vitamin E acetate, which has been added to vaping products as a diluent. It has been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of cases, but not in healthy control participants. Tetrahydrocannabinol-containing products, and the purchase or obtaining of products from informal sources, such as family and friends, have also been noted for many of the cases. Unfortunately, although understandable in the current circumstances, as new EVALI updates are not being issued by the CDC, and cases are declining, the exact causes of the outbreak, which are probably multifactorial, are likely to remain uncertain, although research is ongoing.A study by Sarah Reagan-Steiner and colleagues published on Aug 4, 2020, describes pathological findings from autopsy and lung biopsy samples from patients with EVALI, submitted to the CDC, and provides valuable information to aid further understanding of the outbreak. The paper emphasises that EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion, highlighting the importance of thorough history taking, especially given that symptoms and clinical manifestations overlap with those of some infectious respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. The authors also note that autopsy case series—which have proved to be valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic—can enlighten in terms of alternative diagnoses, improving surveillance efforts, and can provide insights into the clinical disease course and underlying pathology, which could point to new treatment directions.Of note, a recent population-based study published on Aug 11, 2020, which surveyed 4351 adolescents and young adults aged 13–24 years, has highlighted how the effects of vaping might now be colliding with the risk of COVID-19. Those reporting use of e-cigarettes only, or dual use with tobacco, were at a five-times or seven-times increased risk, respectively, of a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with non-users. These findings were adjusted for several major confounders, such as age, sex, and obesity. Dual users within the past 30 days were also at an increased risk of having COVID-like symptoms. Given the known damage to the lungs in EVALI cases, highlighted in the autopsy series described above, the finding of an increased risk of a COVID-19 diagnosis in those who vape is pertinent. Preliminary evidence has also suggested that nicotine might upregulate the ACE2 receptor, the point of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and work is underway to study the effects of vaping on this receptor. The accumulating evidence for risks of COVID-19 in those who use e-cigarettes has prompted legislators to write a letter to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, Dr Stephen Hahn, earlier this week, asking for e-cigarettes to be withdrawn from the market during the pandemic.Although those of a younger age are generally thought to be at a lower risk of developing COVID-19 disease than older age groups, all efforts should be made to prevent a young and susceptible population from vaping. Steps in the right direction have been made over the past year. These include raising the age at which e-cigarettes can be bought, the US Tobacco 21 legislation, the FDA's measures in Feb, 2020, to reduce the number of flavours available, and appropriate taxing of these products in the USA.For many adults, the pandemic has been a time to stop smoking, and according to a study from Action and Smoking for Health and University College London, more than a million have quit in the UK during the pandemic. Public Health England recommends e-cigarettes as an option to aid quitting; however, surely the precautionary principle should be adopted to mitigate potential damage to the lungs and susceptibility to infection in the COVID-19 era. Smoking cessation services should focus on traditional aids to quitting while the level of evidence on long-term safety and a possible interaction between COVID-19 and e-cigarette use remains uncertain, and while our knowledge on the causes of EVALI continues to unfold.
Indigenous peoples: resilience in the face of adversity/-/In commemoration of the first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (Geneva; Aug 9, 1982), the anniversary is marked each year by International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. The theme this year is “COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples' resilience”.Representing less than 5% of the world's population yet 15% of the poorest, the 476 million Indigenous peoples living in 90 countries speak the majority of the world's 7000 languages, represent 5000 distinct cultures, and inhabit lands home to 80% of the world's biodiversity. Compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts, Indigenous peoples have poorer access to health care and sanitation; are more likely to live in overcrowded, multi-generational housing; and have higher rates of chronic diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension) that have been associated with COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Although information on the full impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous populations is scarce, the burden seems likely to be high. Data from the USA show that Indigenous Americans are 3·5 times more likely to have died from COVID-19 than white Americans—making them the second most at-risk ethnic group in the USA after Black Americans.Filling the void left by governments, Indigenous peoples are taking the lead in preventing the spread of the coronavirus in their communities. Examples include the Navajo (USA) closing borders, imposing curfews, and testing more than 40 000 people; and Amazonian Indigenous groups making their own face masks, providing sanitation, and disseminating information about COVID-19 in local languages. Aug 9, 2020 is thus a day not just to highlight the grave threat posed to Indigenous popu_lations by COVID-19, but to also celebrate their resilience in the face of adversity. The world has much to learn from Indigenous peoples—from how to live harmoniously and sustainably with the planet to their knowledge of traditional medicines. For too long the rights of Indigenous peoples have been violated and their plight overlooked. Governments around the world must act now to safeguard these populations who are the earliest known inhabitants and custodians of the earth's lands.
Obesity and COVID-19: Blame isn't a strategy/-/On July 27th, 2020, the UK government released the new national strategy for tackling obesity. In big bold font, the heading of the official press release urges people to “Lose weight to beat COVID-19 and protect the NHS”.In the first 4 months of the pandemic, England witnessed the greatest rate of excess deaths in Europe. According to a New York Times analysis, between March 14 and July 17, 2020, the UK has had 62 600 more deaths, a 31% increase, compared with the same period last year.Obesity, along with other chronic conditions such as diabetes, is a recognised risk factor for severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The new obesity strategy, published alongside the ‘Better Health’ campaign, led by Public Health England, intends to restrict advertisements and promotions of unhealthy foods, improve nutritional labelling of foods and drinks in restaurants and stores, and expand weight management services.The ambition for a healthier nation, during and beyond COVID-19, is to be praised. However, at a time where our economies are fragile, bans on food promotions and advertisements could also result in higher prices and growing inequalities, which themselves contribute to obesity and poor health outcomes. Equally troubling, by targeting almost exclusively the obesogenic environment, and only a small part of it, the new policies fail to take into account the intricacy of biological, societal, and psychological factors that underpin obesity.The suggestion that it is necessary to lose weight to “reduce pressure on doctors and nurses in the NHS, and free up their time to treat other sick and vulnerable patients”, communicated in the policy document, is also one of the most glaring examples of health promotion strategies that draws on guilt and shame. Past Public Health history has shown that such campaigns are ineffective and even detrimental.
The truth is out there, somewhere/-/The tidal wave of information on the internet concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in difficulties in discerning truth from fiction. This so-called infodemic, defined by WHO as an “overabundance of information—some accurate and some not—that makes it harder for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when needed”, has become a major threat to public health. Infection rates will rise if people are confused about restrictions and patients may be harmed if they use unproven treatments or bogus remedies.An urgent call for action to gauge, map, and develop a means of combating this problem was explored at a WHO-organised conference held across April, June, and July. The meeting, which focused on so-called infodemiology—the science behind managing infodemics—brought together experts from a range of disciplines, including epidemiology, public health, applied mathematics, and data science.The term infodemiology was first used in 2002, although concern about misinformation in health and the need for fact-checking have long been present. But now, a growing mistrust in science and experts, poor and confusing responses by political and government leaders, and some people's reliance on social media as their sole source of information have made dealing with infodemics as acute as dealing with COVID-19 itself. While the discipline of infodemiology is in its infancy, some insights are emerging.The groups generating and spreading egregious information are highly organised political or pseudoscientific bodies that are experienced at using nefarious techniques to propagate their narratives. These bodies can rapidly change their names and their key messages, moving from one campaign to another, and consciously seek and target vulnerable populations. Conspiracy theories and misinformation proliferate in times of uncertainty and fear. Such circumstances, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, have occurred throughout history and been manipulated by populist politicians, anti-vaccination movements, climate change deniers, and the tobacco industry. Protagonists and propagators of such fake news have been shown to be motivated often by political and financial gain.An analysis mapping Facebook interactions between nearly 100 million people with various viewpoints about vaccinations showed that individuals cluster into specific, dynamic, interconnected groups. Although small, the anti-vaccination group (4·2 million people) was highly connected with those who were undecided about the importance of vaccinations (74·1 million people). The pro-vaccination group (6·9 million individuals) was isolated and had little interaction with those who were both undecided and anti-vaccination. These observations show that health campaigners who to wish change people's minds ought to focus attention on those who remain open to both good and bad information.Dealing with the infodemic relating to COVID-19 will need a combined global effort involving health organisations, governments, media outlets, and individuals. WHO has built myth-busting teams of internet-savvy communicators to stamp out disinformation related to COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has employed a global team of behavioural scientists and communicators to tackle infodemics as they relate to vaccine acceptance in low-income and middle-income countries. Social media platforms say they have increased efforts to remove disinformation and lead users to more trustworthy sources. However, Facebook, for example, is “rife with bogus cures and conspiracy theories that remain on the platform long enough to put millions of people at risk”, according to activists.At The Lancet, the COVID-19 pandemic has given us salutary lessons about dealing with an infodemic. We are mindful that our readership now extends beyond the health and scientific communities. With this comes a responsibility to explain that different content types carry different weights of evidence, and how peer review and editorial input contribute to building scientific knowledge.The problem of infodemics and the importance of infodemiology are escalating, and not just related to COVID-19. There is collective responsibility to produce clear, simple, honest messages, but individual digital and health literacy must also be strengthened. Behaviour change is needed, appreciating the importance of emotion, trust, credibility, and self-efficacy. The key to infodemics is not to produce even more information, but to address the environmental and social factors that make spreading misinformation easy.
COVID-19 casts light on respiratory health inequalities/-/COVID-19 has disproportionately affected people from disadvantaged populations and marginalised communities. People living in social deprivation, Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, older people, and those with pre-existing health conditions, for example, have increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and its consequences. These imbalances will magnify the already pervasive inequalities associated with respiratory health across the lifespan, and the full effects might be apparent only in the decades to come.Vulnerable populations experience uneven burden of disease, provision of and access to health-care services, quality of care, and health outcomes. Socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, age, sex, disability status, geography, and environment can all place people at a health disadvantage. People living in social deprivation and those from BAME communities have disproportionately greater exposure to the major risk factors for respiratory diseases—tobacco smoke, air pollution, obesity, infections, and hazardous occupations—and a higher prevalence of several conditions, including COPD, asthma, lung cancer, and sleep apnoea. Inequalities are especially pronounced in children with respiratory disorders such as asthma and are evident in cystic fibrosis: children from disadvantaged backgrounds have worse growth and lung function than those from more affluent backgrounds.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to deepen these inequities in respiratory health directly through effects of the disease and indirectly through lockdown measures exacerbating risk factors and social determinants for respiratory disease. The increased susceptibility of people living in deprivation to infection and worse health outcomes places them at greater risk of reduced income and unemployment, which in turn can affect access to health care and health insurance, leading to further deterioration in health. People from disadvantaged and minority groups are already more likely to live in densely populated areas and overcrowded housing, and income loss or reduction has consequences for housing security, all of which can lead to or exacerbate respiratory illness. Furthermore, food insecurity, which has dramatically increased during the pandemic, can impair development and cause lasting damage to respiratory health.Many disadvantaged groups face further barriers to health care, affecting access to prevention services, screening, and management. Such inequalities can be driven by discrimination or unconscious bias and assumptions about poor outcomes in some groups. Differences in patterns of seeking care, health literacy, language, and education might also affect health-care access. Moreover, the diversion of health care during the pandemic from cancer screening and treatment, paediatric and adult respiratory services for chronic conditions, and vaccination programmes will all affect long-term respiratory health.We must make a concerted effort to improve understanding of the multitude of factors that underpin these inequities and their complex interactions with respiratory health. The imbalance in recruitment of people from diverse backgrounds into clinical research must also be addressed to ensure availability of appropriate interventions for minority groups. Improved education and understanding among health-care professionals of inequalities and campaigns to enhance awareness and health-care access for patients are paramount to reducing health disadvantages. Furthermore, practical measures in clinical practice are needed to reduce systemic inequities in care. Finally, the overarching social inequalities that underpin the imbalance in risk factors and determinants of respiratory health need to be targeted through carefully considered, long-sighted health and social policies. Strategies to reduce poverty by supporting people to secure appropriate employment, improve provision of income support, reduce the educational attainment gap, and promote better nutrition, in addition to increased provision of affordable housing and reduced overcrowding, are sorely needed. Moreover, measures to strengthen smoking cessation programmes, reduce air pollution, and improve conditions for those working in hazardous occupations are essential to tackle some of the key risk factors.Respiratory health inequalities related to and exacerbated by COVID-19 must be viewed in light of social deprivation and discrimination. Research to better understand the intersecting factors that fuel these inequities and to identify innovative strategies to narrow the gaps in disease burden and outcomes should be prioritised. Public health goals and policies that promote social, economic, and health equity must be at the heart of pandemic recovery plans to eliminate these deep-rooted inequalities in respiratory health across the lifespan.
In sight but out of mind/-/We opened this year with the hope that 2020 could be a super year for the environment with major policy milestones on biological conservation and climate policy. Regrettably, much of that agenda has been blown out of the water by COVID-19. However, while media bandwidth has been almost entirely consumed by the pandemic, and its political and economic fallout, 2020 has been unprecedented in other ways as well.The first half of this year has been among the hottest on record. As we have noted before, record breaking climatic conditions are now so common that reporting on them risks sounding repetitive and mundane. Furthermore, 2016 was hotter, so no big deal, right? Clearly that is an overly simplistic interpretation for many reasons and in particular because global average temperatures are modulated by regional climatic variations, which influence how much heat is passed between the ocean and atmosphere. These regional atmospheric circulation patterns can push a year above or below the longer-term average, explaining much of the year to year temperature variability. The most notable of these climatic phenomenon occurs over the Pacific Ocean and is known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Essentially when this ENSO pattern is in its El Niño phase more ocean heat is released to the atmosphere, increasing atmospheric temperature, while the opposing La Niña conditions release less heat, typically leading to relatively cooler conditions. Like most other very hot years, the record-breaking global average temperatures of 2016 were facilitated by strong El Niño conditions which increased temperatures, particularly in the early part of the year. What is so concerning about 2020 is that ENSO conditions are neutral (exhibiting neither El Niño or La Niña patterns), so our very warm season so far is occurring unaided by the major natural driver that boosts most very hot years. This implies that if the 2016 record is not broken this year, it will likely be exceeded very soon helped by El Niño conditions when they re-occur.Of course, global average temperature is just one measure of the climate and regional temperatures differ from that mean state. This year Siberia has experienced exceptionally high temperatures, with a record-breaking 38°C in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk in mid-June—the highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic Circle. This heatwave is causing sever impacts in the region, including extensive wildfires, loss of permafrost, and invasive insect pests. Warming in this northern region is particularly concerning because of its high rate of climate change and the sensitivity of the frozen conditions to temperatures above freezing. All of this means that there is potential for significant ecological and human impact and also further carbon release, which serves to reinforcing ongoing climate heating. A team of leading climate scientists have undertaken a formal attribution analysis to investigate the likelihood of both the average temperature for the region from January to June, and the hottest maximum daily temperature recorded. They found in both cases that these temperatures would have been effectively impossible without human-induced climate change. The evidence of human induced climate heating has never been clearer or more tangible.The human impact of climatic extremes is however complicated and in general worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing some 9·6 million people are swamped by monsoon floods in south Asia compounding the difficulties and human tragedy of COVID-19 in the region. As the season continues heat waves are likely to challenge pandemic prevention measures in many regions. In this issue Mahaveer Golechha and Rabindra Panigrahy outline some of the challenges extreme heat might pose to India’s COVID-19 countermeasures and how these might in turn impinge on heat action plans. Foreseeing similar challenges, the Global Heat Health Information Network have provided guidance designed to help administrators prepare for hot weather and heatwaves while managing COVID-19. The need for joined up policy has rarely been more apparent, but it will be challenging to deliver on short-timescales and in resource-constrained settings.Living through a pandemic is complicating just about all of our societal problems and goals. Unfortunately, this additional drain on our resources and capacities changes little about the unfolding ecological and climate problems we face. The very real danger is that COVID-19 looms so large in our minds we miss the obvious writing on the wall about the other problems we must still address. Slipping progress, while very understandable is simply not a viable option, the climate will cut us no slack.
Arboviruses and COVID-19: the need for a holistic view/-/In June, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO published their latest epidemiological update on dengue and other arboviruses. They state that, during the first few months of 2020 (epidemiological week 1–21), there were more than 1·6 million reported cases of arboviral disease in the WHO region of the Americas. Most of these (about 97%) were dengue and the rest were chikungunya (>2%) and Zika (<1%). This prevalence is much lower than that reported in the same period in 2019. A major factor in this overall decrease was a large reduction in cases of chikungunya and Zika virus infection, although cases of dengue also decreased.Of the total cases of dengue, only a very small proportion (0·2%) were classified as severe dengue and the reported number of these cases fell relative to overall cases when compared with the same period in 2019. Although the reported dengue cases were primarily in Brazil, most of the severe cases were reported in Honduras. Most reports of chikungunya and Zika were also from Brazil—the most populous county in the region. The scale of these diseases in 2020 is less than for 2019 but not trivial. In other years, there would be some comfort taken from the decline in cases, but matters are uncertain given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.The pandemic has put much strain on the health systems of central and South American countries and hence governments' abilities to treat individuals affected by arboviral diseases. Moreover, the need to reallocate resources to the pandemic response has put further pressure on public health programmes tackling arboviruses. In their epidemiological update, PAHO and WHO outline advice to member states urging effective use of resources while available, as their diversion to the pandemic response is probable. They recommend that programmes aim to reduce transmission and identify predictors of severe dengue at the primary health-care level. The aim is the reduction of hospitalisations and therefore additional strain on hospitals already burdened because of the pandemic.Around the same time as PAHO and WHO's update, a perspective piece by Annelies Wilder-Smith and colleagues in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene explored the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic is posing on the control of dengue globally. They point out that the greatest burden of dengue is in southeast Asia (with the majority of worldwide infections that WHO estimates is about 390 million per year). So, the concerns that PAHO and WHO outlined for South America are orders of magnitude greater in southeast Asia. Wilder-Smith and colleagues also pointed out that some countries in South American and southeast Asia experienced a surge in dengue cases just when the COVID-19 pandemic was having an impact. The difficulty in distinguishing dengue and COVID-19 at the early stages of these diseases probably complicated the COVID-19 response because COVID-19 patients misdiagnosed with dengue would not have been isolated. Conversely, not recognising dengue could have led to a failure to provide lifesaving early hydration.Related to considerations of arboviruses and COVID-19 are concerns that haematophagus insects might serve as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the case of mosquitoes, these fears have been placated by the work of Yang-Jang Huang and colleagues. They clarify from the outset that talk of transmission via this route is speculative and that WHO has emphasised that “there has been no information nor evidence” of transmission via mosquitoes. However, in this age of hard-line empiricism, they provide the first experimental evidence assessing this possibility. They attempted to infect Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus with SARS-CoV-2 without success. Without an infection step onward transmission is not possible.We are now entering a phase of the pandemic where SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered together with other infectious diseases and the many ways in which they might interact. Beyond arboviral diseases, there is concern for the upcoming northern hemisphere influenza season. These potential interactions emphasise the importance of warnings about concentrating efforts on tackling COVID-19 to the exclusion of all else, what Madhukar Pai has described as covidisation. While it might once have been seen as entirely an issue of resource allocation, now weaving other infections into the discussion is essential to understanding the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that might shape it in the future.For the PAHO and WHO arbovirus update see https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-dengue-and-other-arboviruses-10-june-2020

Eliminating viral hepatitis in the COVID-19 era: weighing challenge and opportunity/-/World Hepatitis Day—July 28—offers a timely opportunity to turn the spotlight towards global efforts to address viral hepatitis. Worldwide, the hepatitis viruses are responsible for an estimated 1·34 million deaths a year, with a disproportionate disease burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The ambitious WHO goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 faces many obstacles, yet none are more significant than that posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.Infection prevention is a foundational goal of efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis, particularly for hepatitis B virus (HBV), for which vaccinations are available but curative treatment does not exist. Progress in increasing birth-dose HBV vaccination rates has been hindered by the vaccine not being included in national vaccination schedules, births occurring at home, and lack of birth-dose vaccine awareness among health-care workers. Funding has also been an issue. COVID-19 is likely to place substantial further pressure on government budgets and change policy priorities; restrictions on movement and fear of infection might also increase home births and further limit immunisation access. Direct assessment of the impact of COVID-19 regulations on HBV vaccination coverage will therefore be important to ensure that they do not cause net harm.For HCV, prevention efforts focus on harm reduction measures (eg, needle and syringe programmes [NSPs] and education packages) for populations at high risk, such as people who inject drugs, prisoners, and men who have sex with men. COVID-19 has led to widespread disruption or closure of harm reduction services. In England, the number of people accessing NSPs fell by 36% and needles distributed to those injecting psychoactive drugs halved as a result of lockdown restrictions. In LMICs, these pressures are likely to be even more keenly felt.Underdiagnosis of viral hepatitis is a key bottleneck in elimination efforts. Globally, an estimated 91% of individuals with chronic HBV infection and 80% of those with chronic HCV infection were undiagnosed in 2017. Surveillance and diagnosis services have been disrupted by COVID-19, owing to redeployed staff, equipment, and closed facilities. In a World Hepatitis Alliance (WHA) survey of civil society organisations and frontline hepatitis service providers in 32 countries from March 30 to May 4, 2020, only 47 (36%) of 132 respondents reported that people were able to access testing services, with closure or avoidance of testing sites due to COVID-19 identified as key reasons. Global supply chain issues have also led to shortages of HBV and HCV test reagents, with LMICs disproportionately affected.In individuals with a diagnosis, timely linkage to care and access to treatment is likely to be hampered by movement restrictions and suspension of centralised clinical services. The WHA survey data indicate that treatment access has been particularly affected by COVID-19 in LMICs, with 15 (52%) of 29 respondents from those countries reporting that patients are unable to access therapies. According to the HCV Action network, the impact of COVID-19 on HCV treatment in the UK has been less than feared, in part owing to expanded use of home medication delivery and telemedicine, but such an approach is likely to be less feasible in LMICs.Despite the broad negative effects of COVID-19 on viral hepatitis elimination, there are glimmers of opportunity. From a practical perspective, developments arising from the need to rapidly decentralise elimination efforts, such as postal dried blood-spot testing and medication delivery, could enable improved care for difficult to reach populations. The ambitious possibility has also been raised of combining large-scale COVID-19 surveillance and contact tracing efforts, which have been initiated in many countries, with testing for viral hepatitis and other diseases. Politically, the pandemic has brought the use of mass testing, contact tracing, and vaccination to the fore, and there is optimism that success in these domains can be used to emphasise the tangibility of viral hepatitis elimination.In the long-term, the negative economic effects of the pandemic will exert extra pressure on viral hepatitis-related public health initiatives, further endangering hopes of a hepatitis-free future. In the coming months and years, it will be crucial to ensure that policy makers do not lose sight of the clear benefits of viral hepatitis elimination, and that the opportunities presented by the current crisis are identified and seized upon when possible.For more on the impact of COVID-19 on harm reduction services in England see Int J Drug Policy 2020; published online July 15.

COVID-19 and China: lessons and the way forward/-/China has largely controlled COVID-19. A country of 1·4 billion people and a size similar to Europe or the USA now reports only clusters of cases rather than widespread community transmission. China has been widely criticised for its role and responsibilities during the pandemic because of censorship, transparency, and human rights concerns. But the rest of the world can still learn from China's successes in bringing its outbreak under control.China's response shows the importance of domestic research and public health capacity. Huge investments have left China much better prepared for COVID-19 than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). When SARS broke out in 2002, China was unprepared initially, especially as the pathogen was unknown. When COVID-19 emerged in December, 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus and shared genomic sequencing data internationally on Jan 11, 2020. By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had characterised the clinical features of patients with COVID-19, person-to-person transmission, genomic characteristics, and epidemiology, warning the world about the threat of COVID-19 with research papers published in The Lancet. China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, with promising results of early trials of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine developed in China published in The Lancet in May and July. Such research was done incredibly fast and rigorously through close cooperation within China at a time of national emergency. For other countries, particularly low-income and middle-income countries, China's experience shows the importance of investing in national health and research systems to enhance laboratory capacity as well as workforce. They are fundamental to a quick and effective national response to health emergencies and to global health security.A second lesson is that a robust foundation of research cannot guarantee effective control without strong top-level political commitment to use science to tackle the outbreak decisively. Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in a way that is best for society. China's National Health Commission sent three groups of national infectious disease experts to Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak to investigate the risks and transmission of COVID-19, and their recommendations informed the decision to lockdown Wuhan on Jan 23. When Chen Wang, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and colleagues saw the need for Fangcang shelter hospitals, the government was quick to respond.Third, achieving rapid and effective implementation of control measures for COVID-19 requires broad community engagement. Community solidarity has been unprecedented during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Control measures that could sacrifice individual freedom, like mandatory mask-wearing in public areas, were accepted readily by the public. Millions of China's community workers have “built the first line of defense against COVID-19”, according to Xinhua News Agency, in their work to provide essential health checks and support for people with fever, severe diseases, pregnant women, and those quarantined at home. There are tensions between freedom and security that each country has to reckon with, and some of China's approaches to surveillance, for example, would not be acceptable elsewhere. But China's experiences show the importance of community solidarity and what it can achieve.So, there are lessons for health to learn from China. But how will Chinese and global health communities work together in the future? China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that globalisation needs to be more inclusive and beneficial to all, that multilateralism must be safeguarded and promoted even more firmly, and that global governance needs to be reformed and improved where it is most lacking. The health community is waiting to see if China will become a multilateral leader in global health, what role it wants in international global health security, and whether it will aspire to fill the vacuum in global health left by the USA.China is facing legitimate questions in many areas of its domestic and foreign policy, but when it comes to COVID-19, scapegoating China for the pandemic is not a constructive response. “Now is the time for global leaders to decide: will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?”, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked in his 2020 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture. Tackling a global health emergency like a pandemic requires open collaboration. The lack of global solidarity to address COVID-19 amid geopolitical instability is a threat to us all.
No more normal/-/Do you long for a return to normal after COVID-19?Before the pandemic, 734 million people lived in extreme poverty, 690 million people went hungry, and 79·5 million people were forcibly displaced. Bill Gates and the late great Hans Rosling would tell you that the world is in a better state than you might expect, and that huge progress has been made. They would be right. Yet for billions of people, normal—ie, life before COVID-19—was not working. We might not be able to return to normal, but perhaps we should not want to. With the climate crisis pressing in, we cannot afford to. COVID-19 is a human catastrophe, but it gives the health community an opportunity to rethink the purpose of society in a fractured world and to redefine what we want normal to mean.The pandemic has two salutary lessons for societies. First, it has reminded us who truly keeps society functioning: key workers. Health workers and care workers, shop workers and social workers, bus drivers, teachers, bank tellers, police officers, farmers, and cleaners. Society often takes these workers for granted, but without them, we would sink into chaos.The second is that society and its systems are much more fragile than many of us appreciated. Some of the very best health systems have so far averted total collapse only through extreme emergency measures and heroic personal efforts, with ventilator shortages, crises over personal protective equipment, oxygen stockouts, and the pressure on the health workforce. Food systems have proven flimsy when faced with stockpiling and disruptions to just-in-time supply chains. Job markets have evaporated in a matter of weeks. The decline of the high street and a hollowing-out of city centres are accelerating. Fragility is not some special property of war-torn countries; it is here, among us all.While many countries face a worsening epidemic, there is talk of recovery and what form it should take. If we are to learn from these lessons, we must make equity, resilience, and sustainability the priorities for our future.The pandemic is amplifying inequalities. The direct health effects of COVID-19 differ by race, gender, wealth, and comorbidity. Disruptions to wider health services, such as routine vaccination and the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases, are likely to worsen existing health inequities. The effects on social determinants of health are devastating too. School and university education has stalled. Businesses have closed and 1·6 billion workers in the informal economy, many with no other means of support, are affected by COVID-19 restrictions. At least 70 million more people will be pushed into poverty because of the pandemic. John Alston, the outgoing UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, argues that extreme poverty has been neglected and that we need to reconceive the relationship between growth and poverty elimination. Decreasing the Gini coefficient, a measure of equality, in each country by 1% per year could have a bigger impact on global poverty than increasing annual growth by 1 percentage point. Wealth redistribution, not growth alone, is essential.To address the fragility in our systems, we need resilience: an ability to cope with stresses, shocks, and change. A resilient health system has effective responses to health emergencies. It has surge capacity. It has a commitment to quality improvement. It is flexible and can adapt. A resilient health system would not plan for an influenza pandemic and then follow that plan when a coronavirus outbreak occurs. Economic systems need to be resilient too. The focus of orthodox economics on efficiency needs to be reconsidered. Pandemics, climate disasters, and financial meltdowns might feel exceptional, but they are not unexpected. We ought to recalibrate our priorities towards resilience to have a chance of coping with them.We need to focus on sustainability for health, society, and the planet. The idea of a Green New Deal, which links the climate agenda to economic justice and redistribution, and a green and healthy recovery from the pandemic, have been gaining political support, at least in rhetoric, but they will only scratch the surface of what is needed. The opportunity to sharply accelerate climate policy must be embraced.The need to challenge society's normal obsessions—efficiency, consumption, and growth—is not a new idea, even to economists. But the health community has a renewed moral authority to call for this challenge. This will require a change of culture as well as a change of metrics. The individuals, institutions, organisations, and societies that have these obsessions at heart need to think again. Normal will no longer do.
The COVID-19 infodemic/-/“We're not just fighting a pandemic; we're fighting an infodemic,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, at the 2020 Munich Security Conference. Fake news, misinformation, and conspiracy theories have become prevalent in the age of social media and have skyrocketed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation is extremely concerning because it undermines trust in health institutions and programmes. On June 29, WHO formally began the conversation on the global effects and management of infodemics with its 1st Infodemiology Conference that convened international experts from diverse scientific and political backgrounds.Immediate and widespread sharing of medical and other scientific information outside of expert circles before it has been thoroughly vetted (eg, preprints) can be dangerous, especially in a pandemic. A pandemic is a rapidly evolving setting, in which researchers and medical professionals are constantly learning and contributing to dynamic adjustments in government policy. Compounding this information vortex is the fact that governments rarely make policy decisions solely on the basis of empirical evidence; political interest is key, and the two are frequently at odds. Governments want to be perceived as being in control and are too quick to provide false reassurances, as Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, pointed out in one of his Infodemiology Conference talks. Consequently, incoherent government messaging and reversals in recommendations on the basis of newly emerging evidence, for example on whether masks are protective against transmission, can be misconstrued as incompetence. Comparisons have been drawn between solid leadership based on clear communication, empathy, and alignment of science and politics, such as that shown by New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern or German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and shambolic, self-serving, and sometimes deliberately misleading reactions, such as those of US President Donald Trump or Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Such miscommunication is not helped by mass media, which are often guilty of favouring quick, sensationalist reporting rather than carefully worded scientific messages with a balanced interpretation. The outcome is erosion of public trust and a sense of helplessness, the perfect conditions for the spread of harmful misinformation that begins a vicious circle.We and many other journals have found ourselves at the centre of the infodemic. Never before has the output of medical journals been subject to such scrutiny. From impartial communicators of peer-reviewed reports, our editorial identities are now conflated with the content that we publish because we are reaching experts and non-experts alike in an emotionally charged global environment. Although we have long worked with authors and media outlets to create factually correct, unbiased stories fit for public consumption, perhaps now is the time for a more proactive response. Journals (including this one) should consider actively countering misinformation about themselves and the work that they publish.Misinformation confuses by diluting the pool of legitimate information. Conspiracy theories work because they provide the comfort of an explanation in times of uncertainty and anxiety. Their messaging revolves around core emotions and values and hijacks the mental cues that we use to decide whether the source is legitimate and thus trustworthy. The most pervasive and damaging of conspiracy theories incorporate grains of truth. But who benefits from this misinformation? Claire Wardle, co-founder and director of FirstDraft identifies three aspects: financial gain, political gain, and experimental manipulation. The anti-vaccination industry is a notable example of the first: a report from the Centre for Countering Digital Hate shows that wellness and nutritional supplement companies are major backers of, and directly profit from, anti-vaccination campaigns. Worse, anti-vaccination content reaches up to 58 million online followers and is deliberately retained by social media giants, creating a cumulative advertising revenue of US$1 billion. Unfortunately, as a UNICEF analysis of the so-called Peshawar incident of April 22, 2019, shows, hesitancy against one vaccine is quickly transposed onto all vaccines and is excruciatingly difficult to reverse. None of this bodes well for the acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19.A state of affairs cannot continue where, for example, the very existence of the COVID-19 pandemic is denied. Immediate, coordinated action is needed from the global political, corporate, and scientific community to maintain the integrity and credibility of professional expertise and rebuild public trust.
COVID-19: the worst may be yet to come/-/As much of western Europe begins to ease countrywide lockdowns, globally the pandemic may still be in its infancy, with more than 160 000 new cases reported each day since June 25. Individual countries count cases differently, so direct comparisons are difficult, but the numbers illustrate a worrying pattern. At a subnational level the picture is nuanced, with local hotspots, but at a country level the picture is clear—the world is facing a worsening multipolar pandemic.The USA, Brazil, and India each logged more than 100 000 new cases from June 26 to July 3. But the pandemic also rages in Russia, forming a belt of infection that tracks through central Asia and into the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Increasing COVID-19 cases in South Africa mean that the pandemic has a strong foothold in sub-Saharan Africa, which is particularly alarming as parts of Africa consider resuming internal air travel later this month. Despite President Trump's July 4 claims that “99% of cases are harmless” and of a “strategy that is moving along well”, the USA has the most new cases worldwide—53 213 on July 4, and a total of 128 481 deaths, almost a quarter of the total deaths globally. These beacons of infection show the fragility of any progress.During the first days of July, 2020, Kazakhstan recorded the second highest number of new cases within Europe after Russia. Reporting in the largely authoritarian central Asian states has been unreliable. Turkmenistan has yet to report a single case of COVID-19 and Tajikistan has yet to provide breakdowns to WHO. Regardless, the health and economic outlook for the region is bleak. These countries have some of the highest ratios of out-of-pocket health-care spending to total health expenditure in the world, with women in particular having very poor access to health care, further obscuring the true numbers of COVID-19 cases. At the beginning of the pandemic, 2·7 million to 4·2 million central Asian labour migrant workers were estimated to be residing in Russia. Many remain stranded in areas with a high infection risk, meaning reintroduction of the virus might become a problem after the initial wave.At the end of June, the Eastern Mediterranean region reached 1 million cases of COVID-19. Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia continue to report the highest number of infections. Most countries grapple with the challenging balance of suppressing the virus while trying to prevent the estimated 66% of the population who are either classified as poor or vulnerable to poverty being pushed into further destitution. The Gulf states are outliers. Saudi Arabia has implemented an essentially unlimited budget, expanding intensive care unit bed capacity and opening hundreds of so-called fever clinics to allow free access for patients with symptoms, and health-care workers are being retrained virtually. Meanwhile, neighbouring Iraq is struggling with oxygen shortages and Yemen faces the human catastrophe of COVID-19 in an unstable conflict zone.In India, after relaxation of a 3-month lockdown, cases are surging. Maharashtra, Delhi, and Gujarat are among the worst hit states, with the army needed to help overwhelmed health-care centres. But some of the larger Indian states have yet to witness a substantial rise in COVID-19 cases, so the country is braced for further rapid transmission of the virus. Unfortunately, although the lockdown bought time, it was not used effectively to increase capacity in the health-care system in India. There has not been a systematic restructuring of medical provision or redeployment of health-care staff. With less than eight doctors per 10 000 population, using these resources efficiently will be crucial in the coming months.In Central and South America, Brazil steals the headlines for the highest number of COVID-19 cases, but Mexico, Columbia, Peru, Chile, and Argentina also have cases in the thousands, forming a clear pattern of transmission across Latin America. A letter published in The Lancet describes the Pan American Health Organization as on the brink of closure because of member states' non-payment. Never has a coordinating regional health body been more important.Two seroprevalence studies from Spain and Geneva published in The Lancet reveal an estimated seroprevalence of 5% nationally (10% in urban areas) and 10·8%, respectively. Even if antibodies confer immunity, most of the global population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. 5 months after WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a global health emergency, the virus continues to beat a concerning and complex path. For much of the globe, the worst may be yet to come.
COVID-19 and Racism—a double edged dagger/-/COVID-19 has emerged as a multi-system disease with diverse clinical outcomes. But its complexity transcends the sophisticated biological machinery of the virus that causes it. COVID-19 has exposed fragile health systems, inept governments, and rivalry between nations, and led to the worst economic crisis in recent memory. It has hindered access to health care for the most vulnerable, and amplified health inequalities.Black people and other ethnic minority groups are at higher risk of both contracting the virus and experiencing worse COVID-19 outcomes than white people, as recognised by Public Health England and the CDC. These health disparities are not driven by biology—they are caused by socioeconomic and political determinants, and are fuelled by racism. Minority populations have a disproportionate prevalence of conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, both risk factors for severe COVID-19. As we discussed in a recent Editorial, it is unacceptable that racial inequity still occurs in diabetes care in 2020.The tragic fate of George Floyd at the hands of a white American police officer and the massive waves of activism it unleashed provide a stark opportunity for self-reflection. The majority of white people might not deliberately discriminate against others based on their skin colour, but how many times have they witnessed white privilege in action and remained silent?Building on The Lancet's long-standing reputation for advocating for health equity, on July 4, 2020, The Lancet group issued an anti-racism pledge. We will support Black and minority ethnic communities and help amplify their voice, and the time to act is now. On July 10, 2020, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology published a Correspondence by Crystal Johnson-Mann and colleagues on how they have witnessed racial health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as both African-American and female bariatric surgeons.We will redouble our efforts to increase representation of Black and minority authors in the journal and highlight racial and ethnic inequalities until such time as equitable health care is achieved for all.
Zoonoses: beyond the human–animal–environment interface/-/World Zoonoses Day on July 6 marks the day, in 1885, when a young boy received the first vaccine against rabies—a zoonosis, a disease caused by a pathogen transmitted from animals to humans. Rarely is a World Zoonoses Day so relevant to consider these diseases and their disruption of societies.New zoonotic diseases are emerging and re-emerging at an exponentially increasing rate. DR Congo has had 11 Ebola virus outbreaks since the 1970s, but six have occurred in the past decade. Coronavirus infections are also emerging more frequently: from SARS, to MERS, and now COVID-19. Not all zoonotic diseases become pandemics, but most pandemics are caused by zoonoses and they have become characteristic of the Anthropocene era.Intensive livestock farming and agriculture, international trade of exotic animals, and increased human encroachment into wildlife habitats, alongside international travel networks and urbanisation, have disrupted the human–animal–environment interface. Pathogens have always spilled over from animals to humans, but exponential human population growth and exploitation of the environment makes spillover more likely, and consequential.In 2012, a Lancet Series on preventing pandemic zoonoses argued the importance of pathogen discovery, surveillance, and prediction of zoonoses with pandemic potential. Today, whole-genome sequencing and diagnostics are used to analyse pathogen spread and hotspots. Surveillance for public health now relies on mobile phone app data, and early warning systems analyse big data compiled from social media, wearables, and geospatial data. Strategies are being tested to predict which viruses can infect people, and which of those viruses have pandemic potential. Efforts to develop universal vaccines could enable us to curb outbreaks early.Global experts have long called for a One Health approach to zoonoses—a holistic approach to environmental sustainability, livestock health, and human health, recognising that a multisector approach is the best way to improve public health. Last week, an international team of wildlife and veterinary experts released an extensive list of ways to change our relationship with animals and reduce the risk of another pandemic like COVID-19. Laws to prevent different animal species mixing, improving animal health on farms by limiting stocking densities, ensuring high standards of veterinary care, and shifting to plant-based foods are among the many feasible options to consider further.Even a conventional One Health approach might not have the breadth to address the full complexities of zoonoses. For example, take the closure of live markets, which has been suggested to prevent the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Although reasonable from a global health security perspective, does it consider economics, culture, and society? Communities depend on animal markets for food, social cohesion, and income. Market closure might drive trade underground, and loss of regulation and monitoring will compromise sanitation, hygiene, and animal welfare. This could exacerbate risk, rather than lessen it. Safe, practical, and sustainable solutions will come from cross-specialty, interdisciplinary, and international collaboration, not from the health and environmental sectors alone.A tripartite collaboration between WHO, the World Organisation of Animal Health, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization was formed to help countries implement the One Health approach. Addition of the UN Environmental Programme would strengthen this governance mechanism further. But operationalising a true One Health approach to prevent zoonotic diseases emerging, spreading, and harming society goes far beyond health and environmentalism. Social and political scientists, anthropologists, economists, and others must join conversations about surveillance, capacity building, and risk reduction. Industry, travel, and tourism representatives all need to be involved in changing the trajectory.Sounding the alarm about the risk of zoonotic pandemics has largely been the preserve of a handful of scientists and global health experts. Until now. COVID-19 has coalesced the research community around calls for establishing broad transformational change. This pandemic is a sobering warning against exploiting the natural world without pause, and that zoonoses affect not only health but the whole fabric of society. COVID-19 will not be the last, and perhaps not the worst, zoonotic pandemic. Climate change has shown how an existential threat to human civilisation can galvanise a sense of urgency in a whole-of-society response. Tackling zoonoses needs exactly the same.
A vaccine for SARS-CoV-2: goals and promises/-/It is the end of July 2020 and the pandemic is still soaring around the world. Former hot spots like China and most of Europe seem to have successfully beaten the first wave of the virus whereas countries like Brazil and the USA are still in the midst or even just at the beginning.It becomes clear that the virus revealed strengths, weaknesses and inequality of our societies and health-care systems around the world. Crippling minorities and those who are less privileged all throughout the world. Strength can be seen in the few success stories of countries that were able to reduce the spread and keep the death rates relatively low. Such approaches were led by science, public health efforts and strong health-care systems that were prepared and had essential resources when they were needed. The situation in the USA is unique as the USA has one of the strongest economies, is equipped with cutting-edge medical infrastructure, and has top medical institutions, but yet the pandemic seems out of control. Lack of leadership, arrogance, and denouncements of science and medical experts has brought the USA into even worse dire straits. There is no national plan to defeat the virus, but the US government rather focuses on defunding and controlling organisations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to paint a better picture of the situation.Now the race is on for a vaccine. Several candidates are in early clinical trials, but three are leading the field. One vaccine is being developed by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics and the phase 2 human trial is now published in The Lancet in July 2020. 508 eligible participants were enrolled, and significant humoral and cellular immune responses were seen within 28 days in most of the recipients of one vaccination dose. The second vaccine is being developed by the US company Moderna and tested by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). First results of the phase 1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020 and next phases are now underway. Given two vaccinations 28 days apart in 45 enrolled patients, the vaccine induced an immune response in all patients as indicated by serum-neutralising activity and T-cell responses. The third vaccine and the most advanced one is the Oxford vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, UK. The researchers teamed up with the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to lead manufacturing and distribution efforts. The results of the phase 1 are now published in The Lancet in July 2020 and the vaccine trial has already moved into phase 2b/3. In the phase 1/2 study, 1077 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or placebo; 10 were participants were selected in a non-blinded manner to receive a booster vaccination. T-cell responses peaked on day 14, and neutralising antibodies were induced in all participant (10/10) after a second vaccine dose.Whilst the trials are moving through their phases and first data are looking promising, we are now asking how we will determine that the vaccine is effective, or effective enough. Early data from recovered patients has shown that even though neutralising antibodies can be found in the blood, in some cases these fade fast and even become undetectable three months after infection. Will it be good enough to just dampen the immune reaction, or should we aspire to full immunity? Short-cuts have already been taken, given the fast development and progress of the candidates. The USA has set up a national programme called “Operation Ward Speed” (OWS) to accelerate the development of a safe and effective vaccine with the goal to be made available to Americans by January, 2021. Traditionally, vaccine developments take years to ensure long-term safety, durable immune response and beneficial outcomes. As a sobering thought, after 40 years of vaccine development efforts we still do not have a vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. OWS is led by the leading medical institutions in the USA: CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health are on the front of these COVID-19 countermeasures.Alongside this programme, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security published their recommendations on how to ensure public acceptance of a vaccine. To achieve herd immunity with an effective vaccine, 60% of the population need to agree to be vaccinated. During a time, when leading scientists and institutions are being sidelined and discredited by political leaders, public doubt in this enterprise is anticipated. We need independent leadership to guide this effort, with integrity to ensure safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Political interests and pressures cannot overtake the oversight of one of the most important medical developments of our recent times. The next worst thing that could happen is to deploy a vaccine that does not work, creating a false sense of security and putting millions of people's heath at risk.Once a vaccine is identified, another big concern will be the logistics of production and distribution. Both the Oxford and the Moderna vaccine are receiving funds by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which was launched as a global coalition in 2017 to coordinate intergovernmental actions to deploy vaccines in order to prevent future epidemics. One can speculate if global efforts would be put in place to ensure fair and equal access to the vaccine. To prevent what we have already seen with the buyout of remdesivir by the USA, we will need to think now, how to avoid a monopoly of only the richest countries and people gaining access to the vaccine. A strategy to avoid bidding wars is essential, to come together as one unit and coordinate a fair roll-out of the vaccine globally. The call for unity cannot be emphasized enough; we are already seeing how nations turn against each other and try to steal information on the vaccine development efforts. We should have learned by now that the search for a vaccine needs to be global effort, just as the fight against the spread needs to be a global response. The virus will only be defeated once it is beaten everywhere.
COVID-19: a catalyst for flexibility and creativity in neurology/-/The European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress took place virtually this year, on May 23–26. The event attracted more than 42 000 participants, compared with around 6000 participants in previous years. Somewhat surprisingly, the Congress has reached a very different audience—only 30% was European (compared with around 80% in previous years); about 40% were neurology residents or students (few typically participate due to the cost of travel); and around 30% were from South America, which is completely new. This eclectic mix of delegates was facilitated by the availability of the Congress free of charge. The changes have presented EAN with a unique opportunity to further their mission “to foster and support the development of neurological excellence in Europe and across the world, leading to better patient care and outcomes”. These sorts of changes, brought about by the pandemic, can be a catalyst for change in other areas too.While virtual conferences can reach a broader audience, valuable networking is more difficult to recreate. EAN offered networking features that were very successful, and other novel opportunities, such as interactive childcare, but further solutions will be needed if virtual conferences become a long-term necessity or an important adjunct to physical conferences. Effective virtual interactions will have to meet the need for new platforms to supplement reduced educational options elsewhere, particularly if physical distancing restrictions continue.Health-care providers and their patients can be at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during face-to-face consultations. There has been a noticeable decline in patients seeking care for some disorders, such as stroke, with obvious health-care implications, but also consequences for clinical training. Even for in-person encounters, the dynamic has changed with the need for physical distancing, wearing of masks, limited physical examination, and prohibition of elective procedures in many countries. How virtual training sessions can achieve the same learning opportunities and high-quality care as face-to-face examinations is a relevant consideration.The challenges of physical distancing are being keenly felt also in research. Clinical trials have been largely put on hold. How clinical research can be resumed and done differently are important issues to address. Some patients with neurodegenerative diseases might be particularly vulnerable to severe SARS-Cov-2 infection, due to age and frailty, so there are ethical challenges around resuming research in these populations. For example, there is a risk that experimental treatments might increase susceptibility to or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection if they affect immune function or necessitate repeated visits to a health-care facility, increasing risk of exposure. Use of telemedicine for remote visits to research participants, similar to its use for clinical care, seems unrealistic for some types of research (eg, those that require collection of biospecimens or imaging procedures).As well as provisions for participant and investigator safety, practical considerations will include gaining approval from institutional review boards to reopen enrollment at a time when they are overwhelmed with COVID-19 research submissions. To facilitate the fast tracking of COVID-19 research, the WHO has proposed a Core Protocol for testing therapeutics. Similarly, the US Food and Drug Administration launched the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program for reviewing study protocols within 24 hours. For non-COVID-19 clinical trials, some contract research organisations have implemented procedures for remote monitoring of trial sites. Further initiatives are needed for improving the efficiency with which non-COVID-19 research is approved. Novel approaches are also needed for the development and validation of outcome measures that can be administered remotely—not just patient reported outcome measures, but also quantitative measures of neurological function, such as the use of mobile applications to assess mobility, tremor, sleep patterns, etc. For remote measures to be useful in drug development, they will also need to be accepted by regulatory agencies.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted strengths and weaknesses of remote platforms for research, training, and education. As reliance on virtual interactions hopefully abates, this should not be a call to return to previous practices. Just as EAN aims to use the lessons learnt from this year's virtual Congress to improve their services, innovative solutions are needed to optimise all virtual interactions. Flexibility and creativity will have to be encouraged if neurological research, education, and patient management are to thrive.
Publishing in the time of COVID-19/-/It is difficult to imagine an organisation or individual that has not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we as a journal begin our fourth month of operating from makeshift home workspaces, perhaps it is time to reflect on our own experiences so far and how they might shape the future of this and other journals.The Lancet Global Health received its first submission on what was then simply known as the novel coronavirus on January 15, after which submissions increased rapidly, almost following the typical in-country trajectory of the pandemic itself, and peaking around April 5. By the beginning of June, submissions stood 185% higher than in the same period of 2019. Given that many researchers were presumably either working on the front line or from home, the influx of submissions has been nothing short of astonishing. Yet what of their quality? If we assume conservatively that half of the more than 2000 submissions up to June have been COVID-19-related, that The Lancet Global Health has only accepted five original research articles in this time is telling.However, some of those that we have published have proven influential—eg, a modelling study by Joel Hellewell and colleagues showed early on that the window for containing COVID-19 by testing, isolation, and contact tracing alone is likely to be very small. The study has been cited 75 times and used in national policy making (with some governments clearly taking the findings more seriously than others). Modelling has been a common research methodology among COVID-19 submissions, yet this period also saw us publish our first qualitative research paper on the experiences of health workers in Wuhan, China. Bringing the voices of these workers, mostly nurses, into the journal was an important real-life counterpoint to the more theoretical work being published and has encouraged us to consider further high-quality qualitative research in the future.Additionally, Correspondence and Comment have provided early insights into the pandemic's influence in various regions, including Afghanistan, west Africa, the Middle East, and Nicaragua. This shorter format has also allowed us to peer review and publish smaller-scale research that would not constitute a full research article. Such pieces have included a rapid assessment of critical care capacity in Malawi and an analysis of the importance of preprints in COVID-19 discourse.As the latter analysis showed, preprints have become increasingly popular and influential in recent months. When rapid dissemination of emerging clinical and public health information is literally a matter of life and death, there is little wonder that some commentators have again sounded the death knell for the traditional journal, with its layers of procedure and ponderous review processes. Preprints ensure speed and transparency and can act as an early signal of the potential direction of the answer to a research question. Peers can commentate openly and point out obvious flaws or suggest new analyses. But for a health worker, researcher, policy maker, or indeed member of the public, there is no easy way of differentiating the most reliable and important findings from the weak, insignificant, or fatally flawed. Without the tedious requirements of journal reporting guidelines, methods may be incompletely reported, leading to misinterpretation. Journal-led peer review is not infallible, especially when already overworked reviewers are being asked to assess complex studies very quickly. But if an editor has worked effectively to identify the most critical papers for peer review, reviewers can be spared most of the noise and concentrate their efforts on the research most likely to make a difference. By only publishing papers that pass this scrutiny, the cream rises to the top and can be scooped up more readily and with more confidence than if it had been left to homogenise with the rest.
Prioritising children's rights in the COVID-19 response/-/Although substantial progress has been made in many aspects of child health in the past two decades, the COVID-19 pandemic and its wide-ranging effects are threatening some of these hard-won gains. Public health measures such as lockdown, school closures, and restrictions in population movement—while necessary to halt virus transmission—are causing prolonged disruption to societal functioning and exacerbating inequalities worldwide. The global Human Development Index (HDI) is projected to decline this year for the first time since 1990, effectively erasing all progress in human development made in the past 6 years.With resources diverted to tackle the pandemic, many clinical and community health services for children have reduced in capacity. Disruptions to pharmaceutical and medical supply chains mean that many countries, particularly those with low bargaining or buying power, are facing shortages in essential medicines and medical equipment. 80 million children younger than 1 year in at least 68 countries are now at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, measles, and polio because of disrupted immunisation services. A modelling study by Timothy Roberton and colleagues in The Lancet Global Health estimated that a 9·8–18·5% reduction in coverage of essential maternal and child health services and a 10% increase in child wasting prevalence would lead to 42 240 additional child deaths per month across 118 low-income and middle-income countries.By mid-April, 86% of the world's children—more than 1·4 billion in total—were out of school. When accounting for those unable to learn remotely without Internet access, 60% of primary school-aged children worldwide and 86% in low-HDI countries are effectively out of education. School closures put those who rely on school meals for daily nutrition at risk of malnutrition, and pauses in education, even for short periods, can have a long-lasting impact on a child's development, well-being, and future earning potential.Reduced economic activity resulting from the pandemic is expected to cause a 4% decline in gross national income per capita worldwide this year, and an additional 42–66 million children could fall into extreme poverty. Widespread loss in household income puts many out-of-school children at risk of child labour and child marriage. COVID-19-related disruptions to prevention programmes are estimated to result in an additional 2 million cases of female genital mutilation and 13 million child marriages by 2030 that could otherwise have been averted. All these stressors also contribute to poor mental health and adverse child development outcomes.These far-reaching consequences call for children and their right to health, education, and protection to be prioritised in the pandemic response and recovery planning. The 2020 KidsRights Index—which assesses how well countries realise children's rights to the best of their resources—shows that, even before the impact of the pandemic is considered, none of the 182 countries included are allocating sufficient budget for these rights.Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity for governments worldwide to reassess priorities—advancing human development and reducing disparities, especially for children, must be a major investment. First, health systems need to become more equitable and resilient. They should ensure access to quality essential services, particularly antenatal care, routine immunisation, and treatment for malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. Strong leadership and investments at the international, country, and local levels are needed to improve governance and to increase the capacity and adaptability of health systems to respond effectively to future crises. Examples include expanding the workforce for child health, achieving universal health coverage, improving water and sanitation, and enhancing disease surveillance. Second, education, especially in the early years, must be prioritised, given its clear benefits in child development and reducing societal inequalities. Therefore, schools should reopen when it is safe to do so, and closing the digital gap will be crucial in providing equal opportunities for children to continue learning, during the pandemic and beyond. Third, as poverty and deprivation disproportionately affect the young, social protection such as cash transfer and nutrition programmes should be strengthened for children, especially those at the margins of society.Although the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened child health, it can also be a catalyst to start afresh. Children's rights must be central in the recovery phase and in future planning, to regain lost ground and to accelerate progress towards a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable world for all.
Drinking alone: COVID-19, lockdown, and alcohol-related harm/-/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, it is frequently said, changed everything. But to appreciate its effects fully, one must not only look at the ways in which clinical services have been reorganised to cope with the flood of patients with COVID-19, or even at the public health measures aimed at flattening the epidemic curve. Globally significant health issues that existed before COVID-19 have not gone away: in many instances, the pandemic may have exacerbated the problem.Alcohol-related harm is one such case. In the UK, which went into lockdown on March 22, data from the Office for National Statistics show that sales in alcohol stores in March had increased in month-on-month volume by 31·4%. Alcohol consumption patterns have also altered, according to a survey by the charity Alcohol Change UK. Reassuringly, more than a third of the 1555 people surveyed who reported drinking alcohol before lockdown stated that they had stopped drinking or reduced how often they drank in the 2 weeks after lockdown commenced. However, around a fifth responded that they had been drinking more frequently in the same period. And while about half of drinkers said they were consuming about the same amount on a typical drinking day, 15% said they had been drinking more per session since lockdown began. Of particular concern was that almost one in five of those who drank alcohol on a daily basis had further increased the amount they drink since lockdown. While these preliminary data must be treated with caution, they hint at the emergence of a subgroup of drinkers at risk of establishing potentially dangerous patterns of alcohol consumption during lockdown.While isolation at home and social distancing undoubtedly have an immediate and important role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of long-term isolation on the health of the general population are unclear. Specifically, the ways in which the stress, boredom, and isolation of physical distancing might affect drinking patterns in at-risk individuals is unknown. For individuals with alcohol use disorder, the lack of structure and familial and social support may lead to relapse—indeed, a recent story in the New York Times reported on individuals with alcohol use disorder who were struggling to remain sober due to the cancellation of in-person support meetings. The disruption of COVID-19 thus has a potential double effect: individuals are put under stresses that increase risk of relapse while also experiencing disruption of the social networks that might otherwise help maintain sobriety.These issues cannot wait until the COVID-19 pandemic comes under control. Preliminary signs suggest that increased alcohol misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic is manifesting as alcohol-related liver disease. While firm data are scarce at present, anecdotal reports have emerged of an increased number of people admitted to hospital with alcohol-related liver injury. The situation is further complicated by the suggestion that, relative to the pre-COVID-19 period, hospitalisations for cirrhosis in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease might be delayed: in a study of veterans with liver disease, cirrhosis-related hospitalisations decreased dramatically in the period after the first reported COVID-19 death in the USA, and those who were admitted had higher MELD scores at admission compared with those admitted before the outbreak. These delays may be due to services setting a higher threshold for access to urgent care as they attempt to shield vulnerable patients from the risk of COVID-19. It might also be the case that concerns about hospitals having insufficient capacity and posing a risk of infection might lead to patients delaying presentation. Whatever the reasons, these reports raise grave concerns about near-term clinical outcomes for such individuals.As with many challenges faced by health care in the wake of COVID-19, there is unlikely to be a single, simple fix. Further data are urgently required to assess the scale of the problem. At the individual level, telemedicine—which has seen rapid adoption since the onset of the pandemic—offers one route by which alcohol counselling and addiction treatment could be accessed by those in need. Virtual offerings could also allow health-care providers to monitor patients with existing alcohol-related liver disease more closely, preventing late presentation of severe complications. Close integration of clinical and alcohol services will be necessary to help deal with the probable increase in new diagnoses of alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease. Finally, governments must incorporate warnings about the harms of excessive alcohol consumption into their public health messaging about COVID-19 if we are to lessen the collateral damage due to alcohol.For the US veterans study see Gastroenterology 2020; published online May 5.

Education: a neglected social determinant of health/-/Education and health and wellbeing are intrinsically linked. The evidence behind the importance of education as a determinant of health is amongst the most compelling. Education is strongly associated with life expectancy, morbidity, health behaviours, and educational attainment plays an important role in health by shaping opportunities, employment, and income. In this issue of The Lancet Public Health, two research Articles emphasise the lifelong impact of education on health. The study by Yu-Tzu Wu and colleagues shows that differences in education and wealth established earlier in life were strongly associated with disparities in healthy ageing across a large, multi country cohort of older people. The study by Marty Parker and colleagues looked at healthy working life expectancy at age 50 years in England and reports inequalities by level of educational attainment and occupation.Education shapes lives—it is key to lifting people out of poverty and reducing socioeconomic and political inequalities. Today—as the world is shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-overdue recognition of structural racism—the centrality of education and schools to societies has become much clearer.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 80% of students worldwide have been affected by school closures, causing an unprecedented global interruption to education. The Children's Commissioner for England found that there were large disparities in the quantity and quality of remote schooling that children received, with more than 50% of students receiving no online lessons and around 10% of students spending less than 1 h per day on schoolwork. Besides providing an education, schools are important to young people's health and wellbeing as spaces for social and emotional development, physical exercise, safety, and a lifeline for those from poor, violent, or abusive households. In their Correspondence, Elizabeth Thomas and colleagues note that during the lockdown in the USA the incidence of child abuse and neglect is suspected to have increased, yet reporting in some states has fallen, probably reflecting the loss of monitoring via schools.School closures for such a long period of time could have disastrous social and health consequences for children, and will probably exacerbate existing inequalities, widen the gap in educational attainment between pupils, and even undo previous progress. Girls in some countries might not return to school when pandemic restrictions are eased. As Annamaria Colao and colleagues note in their Correspondence: the COVID-19 crisis highlights that a school fulfils much more than an educational mission of knowledge acquisition and there is now an opportunity for rethinking the role of the school after COVID-19—an opportunity to redefine what type of school we want for the future.The 2020 Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report, Inclusion and Education: all means all, released this month, is therefore not only timely but also crucial “to develop the education the world so desperately needs and to ensure that learning never stops”, as noted by UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay. The report takes stock of global progress, highlights deficiencies, and provides a roadmap to achieving the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to ensure inclusive and equitable, quality education. In 2018, 258 million children were not enrolled in school. Exclusion from educational opportunities is evident in most countries, at varying levels: “…disadvantaged groups are kept out or pushed out of education systems by[…]exclusion from curricula, irrelevant learning objectives, stereotyping in textbooks, discrimination in resource allocation and assessments, tolerance of violence and neglect of needs”. The GEM report unambiguously calls on all education actors to widen their understanding of inclusive education to include all learners, no matter their identity, background, or ability and to put diversity at the core of education systems. The report calls for countries to concentrate on those being left behind and for inclusion in education—a particularly timely message in the midst of our current societal challenges.Although the GEM report acknowledges that education policy should not be siloed into departments of education, but should be created through partnerships across government agencies, in view of the centrality of education in shaping healthy lives, there is a much broader opportunity here to also help in achieving health targets under SDG 3. Education is the most important modifiable social determinant of health. As we enter a post-COVID-19 era, there is an unprecedented opportunity to integrate SDGs 3 and 4, to achieve the interdependent goals of healthy, resilient, and fair societies.
Let's not forget the basics/-/As countries worldwide relax the measures they had put in place to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, on June 21, WHO recorded the largest yet 24-h increase in global cases. Just over a week earlier, China had reported a new outbreak in Beijing, after almost 2 months without local transmissions. These events are stark reminders to countries that believe they have overcome the worse, that the pandemic is not over and now is not a time to be complacent. The possibility of returning to a truly pre-pandemic lifestyle relies on the development and widespread availability of a vaccine or treatment.17 candidate vaccines are currently undergoing trials. Some countries, such as the USA and the UK, have invested substantial government funds to secure large numbers of doses of vaccines that are currently in phase 2 or 3 trials, as Tony Kirby reports in a News piece in this issue. Public financial support has been crucial in facilitating extraordinarily rapid development and trialling of candidate vaccines. However, all hope should not be placed on a vaccine as there is no guarantee that one will be effective. Similarly, the announcement on June 16 of the efficacy of the corticosteroid dexamethasone in reducing mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been welcomed, but the true game-changer would be identification of a therapy that is effective in most patients, and particularly one that prevents mild disease from becoming severe.As research efforts to develop vaccines and therapies continue, in countries where the first wave of the pandemic is subsiding, governments are trying to balance the easing of restrictions to rekindle the economy with preserving (and improving) the results achieved through said restrictions. Since relatively early in the pandemic, the UK Government has stated that antibody testing should be central to relaxing the lockdown, and it has recently negotiated the acquisition of over 10 million Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to deploy in the UK. Antibody tests reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, suggesting prior infection. Positive test results have been touted as indicative of immunity against future infection, which would provide individuals with a so-called immunity passport that would allow them to return to a normal lifestyle. However, even without considering the logistical and ethical implications of issuing immunity passports, to date there is limited evidence of a protective effect conferred by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Nevertheless, antibody testing can be useful. If done at a population level, it can provide valuable information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms. This information can be used to assess whether herd immunity levels have been reached and to calculate more accurate estimates of the basic reproduction number and infection fatality ratio, thus improving the understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19. By testing samples from adult blood donors across England, Public Health England estimated the seroprevalence to be less than 10% in most parts of the country, and 15% in London, in May. Assuming the tested cohort is representative of the overall English population, these estimates are well below those needed for herd immunity (about 60–80%). Other countries in Europe have similarly found seroprevalence estimates of about 10% or less.Low seroprevalence values in different countries indicate that most of the population is still susceptible to infection. As these countries relax restrictions, it is imperative that they ensure other measures are in place to contain the resurgence of cases and avoid having to impose a new lockdown on already weakened societies. The South Korean success in containing the number of cases and deaths without enforcing a full national lockdown, and the results of mathematical modelling, unsurprisingly support the rigorous adoption of the test, trace, and isolate strategy, combined with physical distancing and hygiene measures, as the best approach to prevent a second wave of infections.In essence, at a time when efficacy has not yet been shown for any candidate vaccine, no universal treatment has been identified, population-level immunity has not been reached, and countries cannot afford another full lockdown, the established public health approach of hand-washing, maintaining physical distancing, and testing and isolating infectious cases and their contacts from the broader community remains the key to managing and containing the spread of COVID-19. We might be reiterating the obvious, but the stakes are too high to take the basics for granted.
Generation coronavirus?/-/The catastrophic elements that have perpetuated the COVID-19 pandemic—global interconnectedness, climate change due to human activity, vast economic inequality, and deep veins of antiscience—have resulted in more than 9 million infections and almost 500 000 deaths worldwide. Although children might be less susceptible to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and generally have better outcomes than adults, COVID-19 as a phenomenon weighs heavily on their health and wellbeing. Today's children are digital natives born after the turn of the 21st century, who inhabit a planet in crisis and now will inherit the unknowns of a pandemic aftermath. This roiling milieu offers a moment in which a new agenda for health could emerge with children and adolescents at the centre, which could determine if this generation—Gen C—will be defined and confined by the losses from COVID-19.With much of the world on pause, children and adolescents have been expected to move agilely between their analogue family lives and digital environments. Yet even children and adolescents who are emotionally and physically healthy and well cared for can experience the potentially deleterious repercussions of this rapid transition. By April, 2020, over 90% of the world's students were unable to physically attend school. Closures intended to slow the pandemic's spread have been controversial and distinctly double-edged.The huge disruption to young people's education risks their wellbeing in the short term, and could affect their entire lives. Schools also operate to compensate for societal shortcomings. For many children and adolescents, the ability to attend school is the difference between eating or going without. In South Africa, where malnutrition contributes to child mortality, over 75% of children receive at least one meal a day at school. Countries such as the USA and the UK have also seen dramatic increases in families reporting food insecurity and food bank use, indicating the burgeoning issues associated with increased financial hardship and unemployment. In places where social protections have been more limited, such as Latin America, the ensuing poverty from a COVID-19-related economic downturn could disproportionately affect children, who could be forced into child labour for survival and forego schooling, a crushing erasure of gains in recent decades to reduce child exploitation.Maltreatment of children, whether physical, sexual, or emotional, increases during times of conflict. Indeed, many metrics of child maltreatment have increased, including emergency department visits for serious injury and abuse hotline calls. Other effects of physical distancing and school closures, such as deterioration of routines or restricted peer social contact, could cause new or exacerbate existing mental health issues and enhance the risk of developing psychological disorders. Safeguarding the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents must be developmentally appropriate for specific age groups, but also for the spectrum of conditions and challenges that young people might have to cope with, including those who are medically fragile or who have special needs. Distance learning might be productive for some older children and adolescents, but certainly not all, and the digital divide created by inequities in access to technology and the internet has deepened.The response from major medical organisations about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents more generally has been muted and overdue, coming at the end of the school year for many. The American Academy of Pediatrics published guidance about school reopening in the USA in May, 2020, noting that communities should prepare for the possibility of repeated closures but deferred to state and local authorities about safety and timelines. On June 17, in an open letter to the prime minister, more than 1500 paediatricians from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health charged that without an articulated plan to reopen schools in the UK, “risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people”.As detailed in the February, 2020, WHO–UNICEF–Lancet Commission, worthy investment in children and adolescents goes beyond formal education and encompasses community engagement and participation. The responsibility now falls to adult policy makers not only to replace what is missing—meals, vaccinations, and exams—but also to sustainably replace and extend the scaffolding, and to replenish the commitment to ensuring that the future for children and adolescents is worthy of them. Children and adolescents should be involved in the rebuilding at every step and allowed to decide whether Gen C will stand for something more than coronavirus.
COVID-19 heralds a new era for chronic diseases in primary care/-/On March 23, 2020, the UK Government enforced a country-wide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to limit transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although spread of the virus has been reduced, the lockdown has created new challenges for primary care practitioners who manage patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs). However, there have also been opportunities for innovation, especially in terms of digital and remote working, and these solutions could be maintained and developed further to improve primary health-care services as we recover from the pandemic.The threat of COVID-19 is a serious concern for patients with CRDs and their primary care providers. Challenges that these patients already face related to their illness include an increased risk of depression, and feelings of isolation and loneliness, which might have been amplified during lockdown, without the usual support from health-care providers, family, and friends. Although the virus might have acted as a catalyst for patients with CRDs to access online support groups and self-management tools to reduce feelings of isolation, and to improve their knowledge about their illness. Improved adherence to preventer medications for those with asthma and COPD has been reported, to the extent that inhaled corticosteroid inhalers were in short supply at one point during lockdown in the UK. This shift in patient behaviour provides an opportunity for primary care providers to actively promote self-management and online support.Confused messaging about whether patients with CRDs were at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, or development of severe disease, might also have contributed to increased levels of patient anxiety. Primary care providers, a key source of advice, might themselves have been unsure of the best guidance as concerns about increased risk were somewhat eased by emerging, reassuring data. Patient communication must be clear and efficient to help avoid misinformation and unnecessary panic, and can be difficult to convey. Efforts to ensure guidance reflects the available evidence, is up to date, and is communicated through appropriate channels is therefore essential in these unprecedented times.Routine check-ups were disrupted by lockdown restrictions; primary care providers had to adapt quickly to maintain care for chronically ill patients and respond to acute presentations and potential COVID-19 cases. Overnight, remote consultations (telephone, video, or online) widely replaced face-to-face appointments in the UK to allow for physical distancing and to prevent spread of infection. 97% of practices now offer video consultations and 75% offer online consultations compared with just 25% offering remote consultations last year. This move towards a digital era will likely continue for non-urgent cases as lockdown restrictions are lifted, and care providers can then prioritise face-to-face consultations for patients who need them. Ideally, in the future, patients—in collaboration with their clinician—will have a choice in the mode of appointment that's most suitable. Some primary care practices have adopted strategies to enable patients to safely visit the facility—eg, with designated shielded sites reserved for vulnerable patients, in which physical distancing is strictly observed, or red sites where people with suspected COVID-19 can attend. Now that the peak of the pandemic might have passed, and demand for face-to-face appointments is increasing, health-care providers can adapt these measures to reflect the reducing threat of infection.Potential misdiagnosis of patients with CRDs being infected with COVID-19 has been a challenge for primary care physicians owing to overlapping symptoms and the initial lack of widespread testing available in primary care facilities. Physicians have to decide whether an appointment in person is necessary and worth the risk of exposing the patient to infection. Policy makers must learn from this experience for future pandemic preparedness, to manage any second waves, and to ensure sufficient and efficient testing is readily available in primary health-care facilities. This will not only allow improved management of individual suspected cases, but can also help physicians make key decisions about patients with respiratory illnesses, as well as identifying the risk to the general population as lockdown measures are eased.Although the pandemic is far from over in many countries, it is time to reflect on what we have learned from a primary health-care perspective in the management of CRDs. The shift towards increased self-management and use of digital tools could help initiate a new era in primary care—one of improved health for patients together with the flexible and comprehensive use of all available resources.
Resuming bowel cancer screening post-COVID-19/-/One of many challenges that will arise in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is how to resume services that were put on hold to reduce strain on the UK's National Health Service during the initial outbreak. One such service is bowel cancer screening, which has largely been halted in the UK since the end of March. Suspension of screening services permitted the reallocation of resources at a crucial time, but this suspension means that more than 1 million people in England have now not been invited to bowel cancer screening, including roughly 675 000 people who would have received a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) by mail, allowing them to be screened at home. Not only is screening being delayed but approximately 8500 people who received a positive FIT test result before lockdown began are awaiting an appointment for a follow-up colonoscopy. Up to 10% of individuals with a positive FIT test could subsequently be diagnosed with bowel cancer, which is treatable with curative surgery if caught early enough. These patients will need to be prioritised once screening resumes, but concerns are now mounting that delays due to COVID-19 will also lead to an overall increase in the number of preventable deaths from this cancer.
Global governance for COVID-19 vaccines/-/The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered serious gaps in the health-care systems of many nations. In particular, it exposes a fragmented global governance system that does not have the structures to coordinate the pooling and sharing of resources needed to combat pandemics. Since the early days of the pandemic, medical protectionism has emerged as nations scrambled for their own stocks of personal protective equipment and ventilators. COVID-19 vaccines could be the next example. Already there is a danger of a vaccine bidding war, with governments competing for a limited number of doses, well before a vaccine even reaches the market.Enormous amounts of public money and resources poured into vaccine research and development have resulted in more than 150 COVID-19 vaccine candidates, ten of which are now in clinical trials. The most advanced candidate is AZD1222, first developed by researchers at the University of Oxford with public and philanthropic funds from CEPI and subsequently licensed to AstraZeneca. Last month, the UK Government boosted its national vaccine programme with £65·5 million towards AZD1222. In return, 30 million doses will be reserved for people in the UK by September, as part of an agreement to deliver 100 million doses in total. The US Government too set aside US$1·2 billion to secure 300 million doses of the same vaccine for use in the USA as part of the national programme Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 medical countermeasures. But neither a nationalist nor a free-market-driven approach will lead to equal access to vaccines.In June, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands formed the Inclusive Vaccine Alliance to persuade pharmaceutical companies to make COVID-19 vaccines accessible and affordable to EU member states. A portion of vaccines will be made available to low-income countries, including in Africa; yet how big this portion will be, which countries will benefit from it, and who will make these decisions are less clear. Many middle-income countries might be left out.Political leaders, including Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, and Xi Jinping, have rightly called for COVID-19 vaccines to be a global public good—a people's vaccine, available to all. At the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, world leaders including those from the UK, Germany, and Canada, together with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, pledged $750 million to AstraZeneca for 300 million doses of AZD1222 on a no-profit basis, as part of the Gavi Covax Advance Market Commitment. The Serum Institute of India will also produce up to 1 billion doses for low-income and middle-income countries. Covax's initial aim is to raise $2 billion to accelerate the manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine on a huge scale and to distribute it according to need, rather than ability to pay.This commitment is commendable. It delivers a powerful message to governments and vaccine developers that if legally binding, solid measures are put in place, and money pledged, vaccines can be made available and affordable universally. However, many big questions remain. Have the funders agreed to equitable access? How will the vaccines be priced? Will governments commit to sharing vaccines according to fair allocation rules being developed by WHO? Can technology be transferred royalty-free to multiple manufacturers? “The question of who will get priority access to vaccines is core to the global public interest, we need to get the governance of these decisions right, otherwise there will be tremendous resentment and unnecessary deaths, not to mention decreased capacity to get this pandemic under control”, Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at The Graduate Institute (Geneva, Switzerland), told The Lancet. Transparency in such decisions is fundamental.There is a urgent need for new arrangements at the global level to facilitate the development, finance, production, and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Controlling the pandemic demands global cooperation. The nationalist and competitive approaches taken by a few high-income countries to get hold of a small supply of vaccines could result in excessive casualties in other parts of the world. Global solidarity is needed instead, and resources must be pooled and shared. Gavi Covax is a step in the right direction.It is imperative that more governments and pharmaceutical companies agree to shoulder the costs of vaccine research and manufacturing, and to share data and technologies. They need to commit to WHO allocation guidelines and cooperate globally to distribute vaccines fairly to those at greatest risk. A pandemic vaccine needs strong global governance behind it.
Political casualties of the COVID-19 pandemic/-/After implementing to varying degrees of success non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 outbreak, countries around the world are now lifting restrictions, many seemingly without heed of epidemic curves, reproductive number estimates, or regional differences in these. Economic pressures are driving these decisions, with the detrimental effects of an economic crisis anticipated to outweigh the damage caused by the virus. There is some justification for this concern: the World Bank estimates that at least 71 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, itself a public health issue, as a result of the pandemic. Thus, for some countries it seems lifting lockdown restrictions is not a choice but a necessity. All countries, however, should endeavour to lift restrictions in a way that considers the scientific evidence. Any increase in cases and deaths resulting from relaxing restrictions too quickly will likely diminish public trust at a time when public confidence in decision makers is already low.In the UK, which as of June 10 ranks fourth in the world in number of COVID-19 cases and second in number of deaths, public approval of the Conservative Government's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak has declined steadily during lockdown. According to a YouGov survey, only 41% of people in the UK on May 29 said they thought the government was handling the issue of COVID-19 very or somewhat well, compared with a high of 72% on March 27. Loss of confidence in the UK Government results in part from confusing and inconsistent messaging at the government's daily media briefings, a lack of transparency around the scientific evidence and who exactly is informing policy, neglect of care homes as cases and deaths in hospitals rose, and refusal to acknowledge the dearth of personal protective equipment available to health-care workers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's continued support of his chief advisor Dominic Cummings after Cummings broke lockdown rules was perhaps the final nail in the coffin of public trust. Unsurprisingly, hypocrisy and an attitude of “one rule for us, another for them” does not win public favour.Elsewhere, public confidence in country leadership is similarly declining. Unpopular internationally and domestically before the outbreak, support for Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has since taken a further nosedive because of his failure to acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic and his open flouting of lockdown rules while thousands of Brazilians die from COVID-19. Bolsonaro's actions have sown confusion and dissent among the Brazilian population, made worse by the government's decision on June 5 to cease publishing cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths and to remove months of data from the public domain. After public outrage, accusations of censorhip, and a ruling by a Supreme Court judge, these data were quickly reinstated, but the damage had already been done.In the USA, President Donald Trump has made clear from the beginning of the outbreak that the US economy is his priority, and with encouragement from the president, many states had entirely lifted lockdown restrictions by the end of May. Lifting these measures occurred despite infections still increasing in some states and the country's ranking as worst affected in the world. The human toll of the pandemic in the USA, combined with disastrous press briefings, Trump's decision to terminate the USA's relationship with WHO, and his aggressive response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations, has led Trump's popularity to slump.Public distrust of authorities has detrimental effects on control of infectious diseases. Not only does it permit conspiracy theories to take hold, but it also fosters vaccine hesitancy. It is not clear when a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready to deploy, but its success will to a great extent be determined by people's acceptance of immunisation. Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise, and evidence from a survey in France suggests the situation is no different for COVID-19. 26% of respondents to the survey said they would not use a vaccine if one became available, with differences in acceptance related to the candidate who respondents voted for in the first round of the 2017 presidential election. This finding demonstrates the integral role of politicians in acceptance of public health interventions. Public mistrust in leadership could also undermine the public's compliance with, and so success of, responses to a second wave of infections.Governments and political leaders around the world might become casualties of COVID-19. How they have responded to the outbreak and listened to and communicated with their citizens will be important in deciding their fates in future elections. Public trust must be earnt, and COVID-19 has made clear who is and is not worthy of that trust.
Technology in the COVID-19 era: pushing the boundaries/-/In the continued absence of a vaccine or cure, efforts to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused mainly on establishing public health and social measures, such as frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing, and travel restrictions. Given the pressure to restart economies, governments worldwide have been racing to find ways to ease lockdown restrictions without putting public safety and the most vulnerable at risk, including people with diabetes.One solution that several countries are relying on, but which so far only a few have adopted, is the use of contact-tracing apps, such as TraceTogether (Singapore), COVIDSafe (Australia), and AarogyaSetu (India). Contact tracing can help to control the transmission of the virus by alerting people who might have been exposed to it so they can self-isolate. Central to the introduction of these apps is the issue of privacy and data protection, hence the use of the Bluetooth technology, rather than Global Positioning System data, to prevent location tracking. However, with the urgent need to introduce new technology during a pandemic, it can be easy to overlook some of the potential pitfalls associated.In April, 2020, Diabetes Australia said in a Facebook post that a number of people with diabetes had reported experiencing connection problems with their continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) apps after downloading the COVIDSafe app to their smartphone.CGM systems can be connected to apps via Bluetooth so that users can check data immediately on their mobile phone or on other devices. However, there has been speculation that the constant active usage of Bluetooth by COVIDSafe could disrupt the communication of such devices with the phone, including the signal transmitted by the CGM app. Some have also attributed the interference to some simple bugs with the smartphone application, that could presumably be easily solved. The Department of Health of the Australian Government has thus advised users to stop using the COVIDSafe app if interference with medical devices arises. At the time of writing this Editorial, this issue is still under investigation and no formal communication has been released confirming or denying it. However, as similar contact-tracing apps are already being used or will soon launch in other countries, including the UK, people with diabetes worldwide should be aware of possible interference with their CGM apps.This concern is especially relevant as different countries are also exploiting CGM to allow remote monitoring of patients with diabetes, in order to limit their exposure to potentially risky environments such as health-care facilities and hospitals. Along these lines, the US Food and Drug Administration has recently released temporary guidance that allows, for the first time, the use of non-invasive monitoring devices, such as CGM devices, in hospitals, so that health-care workers can easily continue to monitor their patients without direct contact. These guidelines have been well-received by companies, such as Abbott and Dexcom, who indicated their intention to donate CGM sensors and phones to hospitals across the USA.Notably, the UK National Health Service (NHS) COVID-19 App has been built using an approach similar to the one used by the Australian COVIDSafe app. To solve some of the technical challenges faced by governments in developing Bluetooth-based apps, Google and Apple have partnered to develop a native contact-tracing solution integrated within a phone's operating system and available to public health agencies. This could help to establish a global contact-tracing system, shared among countries. The UK Government has tasked a Swiss agency to investigate the potential integration of the Apple and Google framework with the NHS COVID-19 App. At present, the UK has started phase 2 of lockdown without a contact-tracing app, and it remains difficult to predict if it will perform as advertised.Whether a fundamental problem or simply app or device bugs that can occur, the concern of contact tracing apps interfering with medical devices should be addressed quickly to prevent creating fear and confusion and undermining deployment and use of this (essential) technology.The commitment to develop and deploy digital health technologies, catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic, is unprecedented and admirable, but not without risks. Now more than ever, safe digital health solutions accessible for all are a necessity.
Salient lessons from Russia's COVID-19 outbreak/-/Alexander Myasnikov, Russia's COVID-19 information chief, said in mid-April that it would be “impossible” for Russians to get the virus, estimating the probability of extensive spread in Russia at “0·0%”. This hubris has been sorely exposed. As of June 2, Russia has 423 186 cases, the third most in the world, while relatively few deaths from COVID-19 (5031) have been recorded. The rapid spread of the epidemic in Russia has highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the health system, and presents the traditionally strong Russian leadership with a new challenge.There were some grounds for optimism. The 2615-mile Chinese–Russian border was shut early, on Jan 30; population density in the country is low; and the public health system in Russia has long experience in the control of infectious diseases such as plague. Although many countries have cut back capacity over the past few decades, Russia has retained an extensive, albeit outdated, public health system. Testing capacity in Russia, for example, is vast, and was scaled up quickly. In Russia, more than 10 million tests have been done so far and more than 200 laboratories are providing same-day test results.This large testing programme at least partly explains the high number of cases. Although many countries have very large numbers of cases, health officials publicly admit that the official number is still a sizeable underestimation. As for deaths, many explanations have been put forward for the relatively low mortality rate—from questions over how cause of death is attributed, to the presence of widespread testing—but data on excess deaths and all-cause mortality are needed to give the best insight into the true toll of the epidemic in Russia.Nevertheless, like in many other countries, there have been conspicuous shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the care system. According to one report, Russian health workers are 16 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than their counterparts in other countries, accounting for an estimated 7% of all COVID-19 deaths in Russia. Russian health workers report having been discouraged from highlighting PPE shortages. There have also been problems with ventilators, a situation emblematic of Russia's vast but creaking health system. Before the epidemic, Russia had 27 ventilators per 100 000 citizens, far more than the 18·8 per 100 000 in the USA. However, many of these ventilators were old and doctors have complained about their quality.There are also regional variations to contend with. Quality of health care differs greatly across Russia's many regions, which have varying levels of preparation and equipment. A doctor speaking to the BBC called the kit available to doctors in Dagestan “primitive”, and the region has capacity for fewer than 1000 tests a day among a population of more than 3 million. According to a local health minister, 40 health workers have died of COVID-19 in Dagestan, which is more than the official total of all COVID-19 fatalities for the region.Regionalisation and delegation have led to a problem with overall public health messaging, a consistent feature of countries struggling to manage their COVID-19 outbreaks. On May 11, President Vladimir Putin called an end to Russia's “non-working period”, first declared on March 30. As part of these measures, wages were paid by companies for furloughed workers, rather than the state, but the removal of these measures meant companies could refuse to pay workers who did not return to work. The return to work for Russians clashed with the message from deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, who subsequently explained that only 11 of Russia's 85 regions were in the position to loosen restrictions at all. Although regions have been in charge of their own lockdown measures, the message from the central powers has been the need to return to work and restart the economy.Among all of this, public trust in Putin appears to be eroding, with his approval rating tumbling in recent weeks. There is a sense that by leaving the difficult decisions about public health to the regions he will absent himself from blame for the toll of the pandemic in Russia. The USA, Brazil, and to an extent the UK, have seen how local government and the public often have to use their own best judgment when they do not receive direct, consistent messaging from the top. There are many unique factors at play in the Russian epidemic, but a lack of clear political leadership has become a common hallmark of countries that have suffered the most.
COVID-19: A time for renewed recognition of science/-/The world's largest annual celebration of biomedical science takes place on June 11, 2020. Founded by the UK Institute of Biomedical Science, Biomedical Science Day aims to celebrate the countless ways biomedical research enriches our health care. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to immobilise everyday life, this special day is a good chance to reflect on the tremendous efforts biomedical scientists have exerted in tackling this crisis.“Following the science” has been the mantra repeated by governments across the world during this pandemic, and scientists have had an instrumental role by continually informing policy makers. However, this mantra is not without its challenges. The scientific method typically involves careful observation, rigorous scepticism, and an iterative self-correction process that is not necessarily conducive to formulating policy in a rapidly changing global health crisis. On May 20, 2020, Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, stated that “scientists should stick to advice and then it is for government to accept the advice and decide what to do with it.” This statement was in response to growing unease that governments might start attributing blame to scientists for providing incorrect advice during this crisis. After all, hindsight is an exact science. As lockdowns are gradually eased, maintaining an effective working relationship between government and scientists will be crucial for tracking and tracing new cases and devising therapeutic strategies to minimise the chances of a second wave.As this editorial goes to press, the worldwide number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals now exceeds 5 million, precipitating a swift and collaborative response from the scientific community. The rapid publication and dissemination of robust, peer-reviewed research has been crucial to inform these efforts. On January 30, 2020, less than one month after patients first presented with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, The Lancet published the first genomic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2. This publication initiated a scramble to understand the virus and the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19. Indeed, over 18 000 publications relating to COVID-19 have been indexed in PubMed since January, 2020; a number that does not include the deluge of studies deposited on non-peer reviewed preprint platforms. Sensitive tests for active infection have been quickly developed and implemented, followed by antibody tests to assess if an individual has had exposure to the virus. Understanding why some individuals fare worse is also an active area of research with scientists trying to look for genetic and environmental clues that might make an individual more susceptible to this novel coronavirus.This critical research is expensive, and emergency funding initiatives have been established across the world. On May 4, 2020, the EU held an online pledging conference in which 40 countries and donors took part. More than US $8 billion was promised to help develop a SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine and fund research for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In the USA, the National Institutes of Health has launched several initiatives, including the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative and the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Innovations and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership. RADx has $1.5 billion federal stimulus funding and ACTIV aims to develop a collaborative framework to fast-track vaccine and drug candidates and streamline clinical trials. Vaccine development is already showing promise and, on May 22, 2020, The Lancet published the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine from China. The study reported that a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a SARS-CoV-2 strain was tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination in healthy individuals. Moderna (MA, USA) also recently announced positive interim phase 1 data for its mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) against SARS-CoV-2. The rapidity of vaccine development has been astonishing, but only further testing will confirm if these promising findings will translate into successful vaccines that can be rolled-out around the world.For scientists whose research is not directly linked to the response to COVID-19, this pandemic has imposed a range of different challenges. Many research laboratories have either been repurposed to focus on COVID-19 or shut for all but the most essential experiments meaning research has stalled. This situation is not ideal, especially when research output is a key determinant for extending short-term contracts. According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, around three-quarters of education and scientific enterprises have taken measures to reduce hours, lay off, or furlough staff to cope with the financial pressures of the lockdown. For those working overseas, lockdown has trapped them away from home and separated them from their families. These factors are likely to have a profound effect on physical and mental wellbeing. On June 1, 2020, The Lancet Psychiatry published a position paper setting out immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research to address the psychological consequences of this pandemic. It is hoped that efforts such as these will help to support the mental wellbeing of individuals that have been affected.As laboratories are gradually being given permission to reopen, scientists wait with trepidation as plans are devised to do this as safely as possible. The term “new normal” is being used to describe life after lockdown, but how might this pandemic shape future research and what might post-lockdown life look like for scientists? Practically, reintroducing scientists back to the lab will likely involve strict distancing measures. Wearing face masks, limiting the number of people in communal areas, and shifting (or staggering) working days to avoid a typical rush hour might be enforced. Scientifically, funding bodies might re-direct money towards infectious disease research to better prepare for future pandemics. Virtual conferences might become more prevalent in response to the demise of airlines and reluctance to travel internationally. This change might prove to be a more inclusive system as they can be virtually attended by more people because of reduced fees and the absence of logistical constraints. Societally, this crisis has highlighted the importance of scientists and the need to share knowledge and data. Perhaps this change will lead to a renewed recognition of science in society and increased funding to nurture this partnership.Whatever the future holds, EBioMedicine would like to take this opportunity to thank the brilliant scientists throughout the world whose efforts are making a difference. From processing tests and performing research, to ensuring rapid peer review and creating an important dialogue with the public to ensure opinions have a factual basis, scientists have been vital. Biomedical Science Day is an opportunity to celebrate these achievements and to applaud the work that you do!
Prioritising mental health after the pandemic/-/The initial fear and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 is beginning to subside, and the majority of countries, particularly in Europe, appear to be past the peak of the pandemic. Significant attention has been focused on decreasing the spread of the infection; however, an unintended consequence of such measures is the effect on the mental health of the population.Unprecedented efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as prolonged lockdown and physical distancing, restrict daily life and affect behavioural patterns. A UK report done between May 20 and 22 by King's College London and Ipsos MORI, based on 2254 online interviews, revealed that half of the participants reported a negative effect on their sleep during lockdown. Worryingly, this number increased to almost two-thirds among people with financial difficulties and increased stress, suggesting a disproportionate effect on mental health in particular socioeconomic groups. Previous financial crises and recessions suggest that the economic downturn expected to hit after the pandemic is likely to increase the number of people suffering from mental health conditions. As economic repercussions affect communities differently, the increased prevalence of mental illness will be unevenly distributed, highlighting the inequalities in our society.Although the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is felt by the population at large, it poses complex challenges for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. The isolation imposed by lockdowns and physical distancing is associated with increased anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide attempts. Furthermore, scaremongering and the spread of misinformation might trigger or exacerbate these issues. Mental health helplines in the UK and the USA have had substantial increases in calls during the pandemic; however, because the majority of mental health-care services are delivered in the community, patients have had interrupted access to care. Additionally, those experiencing relapses in their conditions due to heightened anxiety or stress might struggle to find the help they need because of changes in how health-care systems are currently operating. For children and adolescents with mental-health needs, school closures might result in disruptions to their routine and reduced access to their usual resources. Patients admitted to hospital with severe mental illness are a particularly vulnerable and high-risk group, and reducing viral spread in psychiatric treatment facilities poses a significant additional challenge.The pandemic has strained health-care systems and placed high demands on health-care workers. Not only are health-care workers at an increased risk of infection compared with the general public, but they are also more likely to develop mental health problems as a result of the pandemic. According to the British Medical Association, lack of personal protective equipment, longer working hours, increased stress, and patient deaths have significantly affected the mental health of health-care workers in the UK. Additionally, in some cases, the risk of exposure and concern about infecting loved ones has forced health-care workers out of their family homes. Surveys of doctors and nurses in China, Italy, the UK, and the USA during the pandemic reveal higher rates of stress, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Previous studies from the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola outbreaks suggested that health-care workers developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance abuse, suggesting that this is a possible scenario in the current pandemic.Stress is an important risk factor for alcohol misuse. Alcohol sales during the pandemic have increased in several countries, including the UK, Belgium, and the USA. The long-term health effects of increased alcohol consumption are widely known, and alcohol has also been shown to be strongly associated with domestic violence. Furthermore, confinement, coupled with the psychological and economic stressors associated with the pandemic, could result in an increase in intimate partner violence and domestic abuse. In fact, a surge of domestic violence cases has been reported globally. However, isolation, workplace and school closures, and reduced access to health-care mean that those affected are less likely to find help.The full extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health will become more apparent in the coming months, and might persist much longer than the impact on physical health. The National Health Service is anticipating an increased demand for mental health services once the effects of the pandemic and lockdown measures on people with pre-existing mental health conditions, health-care workers, and the general public become more evident.COVID-19 has undoubtedly presented new challenges; however, it has also exacerbated the pervasive inequalities in our society. Mental illness and mental health services have often been overlooked, and this neglect has intensified the suffering of the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Accordingly, effective measures should be rapidly undertaken to reduce these damaging effects. Population-wide screening, aimed at identifying people at increased risk including health-care professionals, and collecting and analysing large-scale, high-quality data are required to mitigate the long-term mental health consequences of the pandemic.What the pandemic has provided us with, however, is a rare opportunity to produce lasting change and to build fairer societies and health-care systems, and this cannot be achieved without prioritising mental health and recognising the needs of the most vulnerable.
COVID-19 and the US health insurance conundrum/-/The devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic go far beyond public health; with many industries on hold and unemployment increasing worldwide, the global economy is approaching the deepest recession in living memory. In the USA, where health insurance is largely provided by employers and more than 30 million people have filed for unemployment in the past 2 months, such a recession could cause an unprecedented surge in uninsured or underinsured people. Indeed, an analysis published on May 4, 2020, has estimated that if unemployment in the USA reaches 20%, 25–43 million people could lose their health insurance. For patients with cancer, for whom care is already expensive and long lasting, this could be a fatal blow.A recent report has estimated a delay in more than 22 million cancer screening tests and a 20% decrease in the number of interactions between patients and their oncologists in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also states that US doctors are prioritising patients with more aggressive tumours. Although this approach is understandable at this time, delayed screening and reduced treatment of early stage disease could result in the need for longer and more complex treatments for more advanced stage disease. Coupled with the anguish and mental health effects associated with the uncertainty of treatment plans and outcomes, the demands on cancer care will inevitably increase in the future, driving individual health-care costs even higher, just at a time when patients' ability to pay is hugely compromised.The options for US patients with no health insurance are scarce. Some companies and charities are fighting to improve health insurance access, but a large increase in out-of-pocket health expenses could drive many patients into bankruptcy. Although some might find respite in opting for Medicaid or COBRA (a federal mechanism that extends health insurance after employment ends), not everyone is eligible for the former, and the latter can be unaffordable.Although efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic are of paramount importance, in the USA, measures are urgently needed to avoid severe economic and social outcomes, and a tighter regulation on health-care prices, with a particular focus on private community oncology providers, is needed urgently.
The neurological impact of COVID-19/-/Since WHO declared COVID-19 as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020, neurologists' lives have changed in many ways. Now—almost 4 months later—the impact of COVID-19 on neurological services and patients is profound. COVID-19 and mandatory social distancing have forced neurology practices worldwide to dramatically reshape their delivery of care. Simultaneously, non-urgent surgical procedures and medical appointments have been cancelled to increase bed capacity and care for patients with the infection, while many neurologists have had to leave their clinics to help other physicians on the frontlines. As the full clinical spectrum of COVID-19 continues to be described, preliminary findings from case reports and case series have uncovered neurological complications. An important step will be to get a better understanding of the acute and post-infectious neurological manifestations of COVID-19 to guide long-term management and health service reorganisation.Therapeutic decision making requires awareness and recognition of neurological manifestations. However, for patients with COVID-19, much is still unknown about the neurological complications (eg, their frequency, accurate characteristics, pathophysiology, risk factors, and prognosis), and regional differences in the disease course and outcomes are likely. Besides, while there is evidence suggesting that comorbidities such as hypertension increase the severity of COVID-19, less is known on the risk for patients with neurological disorders.To accelerate research into the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the neurological complications of COVID-19, several initiatives are underway. Some of them are announced by their members in The Lancet Neurology. For example, a call for researchers to join an inclusive and collaborative global COVID-19 Neuro Research Coalition has been launched. Potential aims of this Coalition are to build on and link existing international neurology partnerships, and to harmonise methods for neurological research related to COVID-19.Joint efforts are essential to gather the urgently needed clinical data to develop specific treatment guidelines. For example, a worldwide consortium—the Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19—that now includes more than 100 centres coordinates three studies to better understand the possible impact of COVID-19 on the brain. The European Academy of Neurology (EAN) has launched a registry to collect standardised information about demographics, comorbidities, general and neurological manifestations, disease course, and outcome of patients with COVID-19. This registry was created in collaboration with Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish neurological societies which have already launched similar registries at national level. Such registries also exist for individual neurological disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis). The Environmental Neurology Specialty Group of the World Federation of Neurology is committed to provide links to all these registries and make the collected data freely available on its website.Neurological researchers are not the only ones racing to understand COVID-19, and numerous projects are starting to take shape. An interesting research initiative, the COVID Human Genetic Effort, set up at the Rockefeller University in New York (NY, USA), might uncover relevant findings for neurologists. The initiative aims to identify genetic mutations that make some people highly vulnerable to infection by assessing the genomes of previously healthy patients younger than 50 years who have had severe COVID-19. It is well known that inborn errors of single genes can underly herpes simplex encephalitis; hence, genetic susceptibility might be also behind the severe neurological complications caused by SARS-CoV-2.COVID-19 will very likely have a long-term impact on the management of patients with neurological disorders. Traditionally, the neurological diagnostic and treatment approach has been face-to-face. However, to protect both patients and health-care professionals, alternative means of care are urgently needed. Bloem and colleagues' Personal View on how to reshape care of chronic neurological patients by use of Parkinson's disease as an example is well timed. Although the proposed integrated care model with a patient-centred perspective might not be easily generalised owing to differences between healthcare systems, it nevertheless has initiated discussions on the future of neurological services.Never before have international efforts and collaborations been so important. While it will take time to fully understand the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, collecting and sharing of data as well as a critical appraisal of the evidence will improve care of neurological patients, now and beyond the pandemic.
The future of critical care: lessons from the COVID-19 crisis/-/The COVID-19 pandemic has put a huge strain on critical care resources worldwide, as systems have struggled to provide high-quality care for a surge of critically ill patients. The response of clinicians and researchers—in providing care in extraordinary circumstances and in rapidly establishing research programmes to explore the potential of a range of preventive and therapeutic approaches—has been impressive. Lessons can be learned from the challenges encountered and the successes achieved as we consider future directions for critical care.The crisis has triggered collaborative efforts to develop and implement treatments and vaccines, as seen with the launch of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public–private partnership. A range of treatments to target the virus or the host response—including small-molecule antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and cell-based therapies—is being tested in clinical trials. Promising results have been reported for remdesivir, but further developments are eagerly awaited. Testing of interventions should go hand in hand with efforts to understand the pathology, disease mechanisms, clinical features, and clinical course of COVID-19; the identification of phenotypes and treatable traits could ultimately help to facilitate a personalised approach to care. The pandemic has also brought renewed focus to the fundamentals of good clinical practice, including the need to make full use of interventions with proven benefit—eg, lung-protective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—and to restrict the use of unproven interventions that might do harm to testing in controlled trials, as far as possible.In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the pandemic has drawn attention to the scarcity of much-needed resources for critical care; importantly, it has also emphasised the need for training and education of health-care workers, modification of guidance developed in high-income settings to establish management approaches that match local resources, and research with a focus on clinical practice in LMICs. Outside the pandemic setting, the Kigali modification of the Berlin definition of ARDS exemplifies the pragmatic adjustments that can be made to facilitate critical care medicine in resource-limited settings. Large, collaborative initiatives such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) have also enabled progress in the prevention and management of critical illness on a global scale. Building critical care capacity, responding rapidly to local emergencies, and tailoring diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to a range of settings should be a priority as we move beyond the current crisis.The substantial heterogeneity of critical care syndromes such as ARDS and sepsis has hindered progress in identifying treatment targets and achieving positive outcomes in clinical trials. A lack of targeted therapeutics and consensus on aspects of management has meant that the needs of critically ill patients are often unmet, with some subgroups exposed to interventions that do harm. In a Review in this issue, Kiran Reddy and colleagues outline advances in the identification of clinical and biomarker-driven subphenotypes of critical care syndromes, which could transform the landscape of critical care as precision medicine approaches are realised. In a second Review, Tom van der Poll and colleagues consider the potential of macrolides in correcting immune dysregulation in critically ill patients, highlighting the need to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from existing and novel compounds.Developments in research and clinical practice will bring new challenges, but also opportunities for progress in meeting the needs of individual patients. Large-scale research networks could help to accelerate patient recruitment, achieve larger samples of predicted responders, and improve the generalisability of research findings. Adaptive platform trial designs could improve the efficiency and productivity of testing. And the hope is that new approaches to clinical decision making (eg, use of artificial intelligence) and the delivery of high-quality care (eg, through telemedicine) will help to ensure that patients benefit from emerging therapeutic options.The COVID-19 crisis has served as a stark reminder of the need for planning and preparedness to allow critical care resources to be mobilised and to enable rapid testing of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to tackle new disease outbreaks. The high motivation for progress in research and clinical practice—with support from funders and policy makers—must be maintained and expanded as we look beyond COVID-19 to the full range of issues that need to be addressed in critical care medicine worldwide.
Food insecurity will be the sting in the tail of COVID-19/-/On April 29, UNICEF published a discussion paper comparing the probable downstream effects of COVID-19 in developed and developing countries. High-income and upper-middle-income countries have borne the brunt of deaths associated with COVID-19 so far, and they are now seeing diminishing mortality rates. Countries across the world are easing lockdown restrictions. But, as this UNICEF paper outlines, for populations least affected by the disease itself, but for whom food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition are already prevalent and critical problems, the worst might be yet to come.The Global Nutrition Report launched this month, with the bleak headline finding that one in nine people is hungry or malnourished. In 2018, almost a quarter of the world's children younger than 5 years, 149·0 million children, were stunted and 7·3% (49·5 million children) were wasted. Progress over the past few years has been minimal and remains far from the 2025 global nutrition targets: to reduce childhood stunting to fewer than 100 million children and childhood wasting to 5% or less.Now, in light of current global events, tackling malnutrition is expected to become harder still. On April 20, the 2020 Global Report on Food Crises was published, describing the factors that have led to a perfect storm for a food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, armed conflict remains a key driver of food insecurity in the region, disrupting agriculture and trade, blocking supply chains, and prompting mass population displacement. Exacerbating the situation since last June, unusually heavy rains have facilitated the development of locust swarms, devastating crops across east Africa. Movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 crisis are delaying delivery of pesticides and stationing of staff to address the problem. Moreover, reports indicate that, where farmers can grow crops, lockdown restrictions are regularly preventing them from transporting produce and livestock to markets, and that rice imports to sub-Saharan Africa that were intended to compensate for the shortfall have been disrupted or stopped, driving up prices of this staple food. Finally, wage losses resulting from government-imposed shelter-in-place orders are further restricting the purchasing power of many families who were already on the borderline of poverty: an African Union study has projected that up to 20 million jobs could be lost in the region due to the COVID-19 crisis.The Global Report on Food Crises estimates that 135 million people were food insecure in 2019, but more recent World Food Programme (WFP) projections indicate that, because of the economic effects of and supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, this number could double in 2020, to 265 million people. In announcing these projections, WFP Executive Director David Beasley warned: “if we don't prepare and act now—to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls and disruptions to trade—we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.”Women and, particularly, children could bear the brunt of the effects of food insecurity, as well as COVID-19-associated health system disruptions. In their Article in The Lancet Global Health, Timothy Roberton and colleagues estimate the effects of these disruptions on maternal and under-5 child deaths in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. They find that even a small reduction in coverage and use of maternal and child health services could lead to 42 240 additional child deaths and 2030 additional maternal deaths per month, with worst-case scenario disruptions potentially resulting in an excess 1 157 000 child deaths and 56 700 maternal deaths over 6 months. These indirect effects will reach far beyond the disease itself, with long-term social and economic consequences for individuals and society.
COVID-19 coagulopathy: an evolving story/-/As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exceeds 4 million cases worldwide, spreading across all continents as of May 12, 2020, we can assert both the substantial mortality in at-risk groups and the multiple manifestations of this disease. It is now clear that among hospitalised patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure are frequent complications, with some patients developing severe systemic disease and multiorgan failure. Moreover, since the initial report from Wuhan in January 2020 suggested elevated D-dimers and prolonged prothrombin time were baseline characteristics of patients critically ill with COVID-19, the burden of thrombotic complications in these patients has been confirmed. The latest data suggest the incidence of thrombotic complications is between 16–49% in patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care.Critically ill patients are generally predisposed to thromboembolism; the combination of immobility, systemic inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis of blood flow can lead to coagulation. COVID-19-associated thrombotic complications seem to resemble other systemic coagulopathies during severe infections, such as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Besides elevated D-dimers and fibrinogen, patients with severe COVID-19 have a mild prolongation of prothrombin time and thrombocytopenia is uncommon at admission, while patients with DIC commonly have prolonged prothrombin time and thrombocytopenia. However, as the disease progresses, DIC can develop in patients with severe COVID-19. The first autopsy series reported following COVID-19-related deaths described extensive diffuse alveolar damage and thrombi present within small peripheral vessels in the lungs. This microvascular pulmonary thrombosis could cause obstruction of small vessels and organ failure. Importantly, in line with these clinical and pathological findings, data from Wuhan indicate that clinical markers of coagulopathy in patients severely ill with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of death.In the absence of robust evidence, interim guidance recommends regularly monitoring haemostatic markers—namely D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count—in all patients presenting with COVID-19 and prophylactic use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in all hospitalised patients, unless there are contraindications. However, a central question that could inform the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies of COVID-19 coagulopathy remains under debate: are the haemostatic changes a consequence of severe inflammation or are they a specific effect mediated by the virus? In some hospitalised patients with COVID-19, as occurs in sepsis more generally, an overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and TNFα, leads to a cytokine storm. This hyperinflammatory state can cause lung injury, including damage to the microvasculature and endothelial dysfunction, which could trigger haemostatic derangements and generation of pulmonary thrombi. In this scenario, early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation might help prevent thrombosis. The alternative hypothesis is that the virus directly or indirectly interferes with coagulation pathways causing systemic thrombosis. In this case, early thromboprophylaxis might be key to manage the coagulopathy.Indeed, since antiviral treatments are generally effective early in the disease course, treatment strategies targeting inflammation and coagulation might be more promising for patients with severe COVID-19. Preliminary evidence suggests that LMWH, which has both anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects, can improve prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19 meeting SIC criteria or with elevated D-dimers. Other anticoagulants, including different antithrombin III, factor Xa, and complement inhibitors, are being tested. However, many questions remain regarding the efficacy of anticoagulants in severe COVID-19; the timing of intervention in the course of disease is key, and the preferred type, dose, and duration of treatment will need to be established in prospective studies.In a short time, the global research community has made an impressive effort to report the different characteristics of COVID-19 while taking care of patients. With only preliminary evidence, the haematology community are rising to the challenge of providing guidance to manage COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in the face of uncertainty. There is still much to be learned about this coagulopathy, but the fast and ongoing collaboration worldwide makes for a hopeful outcome.For more on the incidence of thromboembolism in COVID-19 see Thromb Res 2020; 19: 9–14 and Thromb Res 2020; published online April 30 DOI:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.041

Food security in uncertain times/-/Food systems are fundamental to human health and flourishing and constitute one of the major pathways of human impact on the environment. Impacts include habitat loss (which is implicated in the spread of zoonotic disease like COVID-19), water resource depletion, perturbation of biochemical cycling (including greenhouse gas emissions), pollution, and waste to name just a few. The performance of the food system therefore matters a great deal. The systems we employ influence who has enough to eat and who does not, how much environmental degradation we cause and where it accrues, and also influence the extent to which people consume healthy and sustainable meals right across the wealth spectrum.The global food system produces enough for everyone, yet hunger is still a huge problem. The Global Report on Food Crises, published in April, estimates that 135 million people were food insecure in 2019—the highest number in the 4 years of the report—revealing a concerning trend towards increasing hunger. Conflict was identified as the main driver of food insecurity, with weather extremes and economic shocks becoming increasingly significant. If that wasn't bad enough, projections by the World Food Programme which incorporate the effects of COVID-19 and its economic ramifications suggest that 265 million people in low-income and middle-income countries will be suffering acute food insecurity by the end of 2020 unless mitigatory action is taken. In other words, COVID-19 could roughly double the number of people living with acute hunger in just 1 year, a devastating scenario.There are many ways that the COVID-19 pandemic and its control measures are expected to impact food systems. In the first instance food supply is expected to be relatively unaffected, although lack of labour mobility and access to markets will likely reduce some food supplies and will certainly increase food waste, particularly of perishable items. The main impacts though are likely to be through problems with distribution and affordability.Restrictions on mobility designed to contain the spread of the virus are disrupting food transport and processing, increasing delivery times, and reducing availability. It is critically important that trade restrictions don't further exacerbate these distribution problems. Increasing urbanisation is also bringing many more people into the influence of global food markets, where they are directly dependent on trade for food and therefore are vulnerable to market fluctuations. Distribution issues also feed into problems of affordability because as goods become scarcer, they are likely to be more expensive. With the combination of increased cost and reduced individual purchasing power due to rising unemployment and under-employment, many more people are expected to be pushed into food poverty.It is already a scandal that we have enough food for everyone but fail to distribute it, or at least make serious progress in improving the situation, and the COVID-19 pandemic further exposes the inequalities inherent in our global political and economic systems. The world food programme report calls for pre-emptive measures to avert the worst socioeconomic implications of the pandemic, calling on governments, humanitarian, and development actors to work closely together to expand near-real time food security monitoring, preserve critical humanitarian food, livelihood, and nutrition assistance to the vulnerable, assist vulnerable countries with social protection systems, scale up support for food processing and transport, and advocate for trade corridors to stay open.Regrettably shocks to the food system, like we are now experiencing, are expected to become more common in our increasingly environmentally constrained world, and as we are seeing with pests like fall army worm and locust swarms, shocks can occur in rapid succession and in parallel, further challenging coping capacity. As well as responding to the immediate hunger crisis that COVID-19 threatens, we need to begin to restructure our food systems to better serve people and the planet. The list for doing that is long: we need more sustainable foods which are less harmful to the environment and to produce more healthy and nutritious foods and less unhealthy ones. We need to find ways to distribute food more equally, and it is now clearer than ever, we need to build much more resilience into our food systems, particularly for vulnerable groups. The COVID-19 pandemic is morphing into a food crisis which we must do all we can to avert, but we must also take this opportunity to learn what we can about the weaknesses in our food systems because this is likely to be just one test among many yet to come.
Pandemic versus pandemonium: fighting on two fronts/-/The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has motivated many across the globe to adopt different approaches to understand the virus, surveil how the virus spreads, and search for effective treatments. This health crisis has focused global efforts on leveraging technology to fight the pandemic. Technological tools have undeniable strengths and hold great promise; however, under these extreme circumstances, where rapid results are expected, there are several challenges to be overcome.One of the most discussed technological tools has been the development of contact-tracing apps. Many apps now exist to both digitally manage the notification procedure and to track the geographical spread of the virus. These apps will continue to be important as global lockdowns are eased. However, their success is dependent on uptake, and concerns around personal data privacy might impede their use. A survey of 4917 adults in the USA suggests that the population is divided on whether it is acceptable for the government to use mobile phone data to track their location for the purposes of understanding the spread of the virus, for contact tracing, and for monitoring adherence to policies of social distancing. In a move echoing public cries for data security and transparency, the UK's National Health Service contact-tracing app is being overseen by an ethics advisory board, and the software code has been made publicly available. Likewise, the Australian Government is drafting legislation for its COVIDSafe app to protect data privacy.Candidate treatments are also being augmented by technological tools. Artificial intelligence has been used by companies such as Exscientia, Scipher Medicine, and BenevolentAI to screen for drugs that can be repurposed against the virus. BenevolentAI identified baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis that is predicted to have antiviral properties. A clinical trial investigating a combined treatment regimen of baricitinib and the antiviral remdesivir began in May; however, given that the drug's safety warnings include a risk of developing serious infections and viral reactivation, both the manufacturer and researchers have cautioned clinicians and patients against the use of baricitinib for COVID-19 treatment until evidence of the efficacy and safety of doing so has been established. Such caution is warranted, given communication of a potential treatment can lead to self-medication triggered by the spread of misinformation online, as was the case with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.Communication itself has changed dramatically during the pandemic. Global lockdowns have seen a surge in WiFi and mobile phone usage, with social media being one of the major activities. Social media platforms have served as mechanisms to help people stay connected, deliver important public health messages, and disseminate important research findings. However, these platforms have also given rise to the so-called infodemic (an overload of information about the pandemic), making it difficult to distinguish what information is accurate and what is not. Although tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter are attempting to counteract this danger by directing users to official information sources and removing posts that conflict with public health policies, these moves have not quite stemmed the infodemic, suggesting tighter regulations are required. A poll of 1006 adults in the UK suggests that 33% want social media sites to take voluntary action to prevent the spread of misinformation, whereas 55% would be in favour of the UK Government imposing compulsory action, thus directly holding these sites accountable for what is shared on their platforms. Ensuring that such actions are regulated in a fair and transparent manner with the public's best interests at heart will be key.A general theme here is the effect these technological tools have had on the general public. On the one hand, knowledge is power: being aware of the fast pace at which researchers and companies are developing ways to track COVID-19, treat it, and disseminate information can go some way to making people feel safe. On the other hand, the influence this knowledge can have on them, such as feeling as though their personal data are being monitored, self-medicating with a drug suspected to be effective against the virus, or sharing unsubstantiated claims about the virus on social media, could be dangerous and lead to public mistrust. Ensuring data privacy, appropriately tempering premature findings, and regulating what health information is shared online are necessary steps to overcome these challenges.
COVID-19: a time to reflect/-/The world is six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the global response to which is unprecedented in human history. But just as the pandemic has tightened borders, closed workplaces, and isolated people in their homes, scientific borders have been flung open and barriers torn down. Despite academic institutes and laboratories being shuttered worldwide, the urgency and pace of the pandemic has spawned a new era of scientific collaboration, open discourse, and efficiency. These collaborative efforts have included substantial input from rheumatologists—an eventuality that was mostly unanticipated in the early months of 2020.Since the first reports of disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, hundreds of clinical trials have been designed, launched, and completed enrolment at an extraordinary pace, thanks in part to concerted global and national efforts to fast-track COVID-19 research. These efforts include WHO's global initiative Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which aims to rapidly develop and ensure equitable global access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, and the UK's ACCORD (Accelerating, COVID-19 Research & Development) platform, aiming to identify promising therapies for COVID-19 and rapidly advance them into clinical trials.Rheumatologists have a prominent role in these clinical trials; many are also treating patients with severe COVID-19 on the ‘front lines.’ These patients can develop a hyperinflammatory condition called cytokine storm, in which over-exuberant production of cytokines contributes to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and often death. Rheumatologists' are experienced in managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of their own patients—such as those with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Still's disease, and lupus—and in use of the therapies to blunt cytokine overproduction (eg, the interleukin [IL]-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab).In an auspiciously-timed Viewpoint (commissioned before the onset of COVID-19) in The Lancet Rheumatology, Puja Mehta and colleagues outline the rationale for and safety of high-dose, intravenous anakinra in patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a type of cytokine storm syndrome that can develop in response to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic diseases. The commonalities between HLH and severe COVID-19, have informed treatment of patients with COVID-19 and ongoing trials. Indeed, preliminary data from a retrospective series of 29 Italian patients with severe COVID-19 and evidence of hyperinflammation suggest that intravenous anakinra could be beneficial in these patients, although conclusive evidence awaits results of ongoing randomised trials.In many ways, SARS-CoV-2 has been a great unifier. The rapid gains in our understanding of the virus and the disease it causes have drawn on the expertise of clinicians and scientists across specialties. Epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease specialists are discovering aspects of viral tropism, mutation, and transmission; critical care and respiratory medicine specialists are managing ARDS and multiorgan failure in severe cases; haematologists and pathologists are revealing the mechanisms and characteristics of pulmonary thrombosis and coagulopathy often seen in the disease; and rheumatologists are helping to decipher the mechanisms of and treatments for cytokine storm.The power of such cross-specialty collaboration to produce insights into a complex disease, with the urgency and pace demanded by a global pandemic, has prompted us to reflect on the original scope of The Lancet Rheumatology, much as the pandemic itself has prompted many people to reflect on fundamental aspects of their lives and livelihoods. As such, it seems timely to reemphasise our interest in diseases and conditions that perhaps fall outside—or along the margins—of traditional rheumatology and musculoskeletal diseases. While our primary focus will remain on these diseases, we continue to welcome original research, clinical trials, and translational studies that illuminate the biology, predictors, and treatment of immune system diseases and cytokine-opathies. In short, we are keen to see submissions from research areas in which traditional rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases might overlap with and reciprocally inform other conditions, as has been so powerfully demonstrated for COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic will eventually fade, but we hope that the transformation of science it has stimulated will be embraced, celebrated, and cultivated long afterwards.
We risk letting a new threat expose us to old enemies/-/The impact of COVID-19 is reaching far beyond the direct consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The wholesale repurposing of resources to tackle the pandemic has left little room for ongoing efforts to control other infectious diseases—eg, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Particularly concerning is the impact this shift in resource allocation is having on tuberculosis, with its unenviable status as the infectious disease responsible for the most deaths worldwide each year. Adding to this concern is the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic to nations with large burdens of tuberculosis, where changes in the response to tuberculosis will be most keenly felt.In a News piece in this issue, Priya Venkatesan outlines the effect the response to COVID-19 is having on diagnostics for other infections. It is feared that redirecting diagnostic capacity entirely towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 will hinder efforts and undo progress in controlling other infectious diseases. Compounding the risks of shifting diagnostic resources is the move by diagnostics manufacturers to largely produce SARS-CoV-2 tests. So even if the capacity was available to support ongoing tuberculosis testing, for example, these efforts might still be restricted by a lack of equipment.The research Articles in this issue redirect our focus onto works that explore many facets of tuberculosis. Shannon Duffy and colleagues assess zoonotic tuberculosis and find that Mycobacterium bovis might be an inadequate proxy. Jean Claude Semuto Ngabonziza and colleagues look at false-positive rifampicin-resistant Xpert MTB/RIF results and the need for a more robust approach before moving to treatment of multidrug-resistant disease. Andreas Diacon and colleagues investigate whether isoniazid is essential during the first 14 days of therapy and the inherent risk of including an ineffective drug in a combination regimen.The breadth of topics in the journal related to tuberculosis emphasises that despite being an ancient disease there is still much to learn. It is dangerous to assume that efforts can entirely be directed elsewhere, even in response to the daunting challenges posed by COVID-19. We do not have the freedom to choose between one or the other. That some seem to think a choice must be made begs the questions: are the world's resources so inadequate that we must abandon progress made on tuberculosis to tackle the new challenge of COVID-19? Might a narrow approach concentrating on one disease ultimately prove more costly?The Stop TB Partnership recently published modelling examining the potential impact of the COVID-19 response on tuberculosis in high-burden countries. They concluded that the disruption caused by the COVID-19 response will inevitably lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality in these settings, which will not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2025. There are the usual caveats associated with modelling; nonetheless, this is a plausible and conservative analysis. The predicted damage to tuberculosis control represents a 5–8-year setback and will require significant funding and, therefore, political will to be addressed. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it is possible to summon this political will.In their Correspondence in this issue, Rebecca Brown and Michael Head outline investments in coronavirus research and development. They explain that more than 40% of coronavirus research funding over the past 20 years was made available during this pandemic. Beyond research funding, nations have also found themselves more generally able to release funds in response to the current crisis. This fund mobilisation hints at something that is not really a surprise: there is money available to respond to crises should the need seem sufficiently urgent. But why does an infectious disease responsible for an average of 4000 deaths a day not warrant this urgency?Somehow tuberculosis is not broadly seen as an urgent problem; given the international response to COVID-19, we know what an urgent response looks like. Now might not be the time to ramp up spending on tuberculosis as so many efforts are focussed elsewhere, but equally we must not be short-sighted and assume that a major infectious disease can be left to its own devices while we address a new priority. The problem here is not really about the understandably intense response to COVID-19, it is one of political will when it comes to major infectious diseases that need a long-term view. Although it is fair to criticise COVID-19 responses that seem to exclude all else, there is a wider issue here: why is tuberculosis, despite its unenviable status, so easily overlooked?
COVID-19 in Africa: no room for complacency/-/Despite over 100 000 confirmed cases and infections in every country, the passage of COVID-19 through the African continent remains somewhat enigmatic. High numbers of deaths were expected in the region due to fragile health systems, lack of access to preventive measures, barriers to testing, and potentially vulnerable populations. But, according to WHO, Africa is the least affected region globally, with 1·5% of the world's reported COVID-19 cases and 0·1% of the world's deaths. Although comparisons are inaccurate, mortality rates have been lower compared with outbreaks of similar size elsewhere. Many hypotheses have been suggested for this paradox, including sensitivity of the virus to ambient temperature, Africa's comparatively young population, lower rates of obesity, and familiarity with infectious disease outbreaks. Low levels of testing might be artificially lowering apparent infection rates. The situation in the continent is highly heterogeneous and progress varies considerably.In February, 2020, while many other countries were still dismissing the emerging outbreak, the African Union acted swiftly, endorsing a joint continental strategy in conjunction with WHO. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had considerably expanded COVID-19 testing capabilities by the end of the month. Many African countries acted early, enforcing a lockdown and border closure. But these strict restrictions have not been without difficulty. Human rights organisations have voiced concerns about abusive implementation of lockdowns by police and military, including in South Africa. 71% of Africans work in the informal sector and many have no financial reserves. Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, and other countries have initiated emergency programmes for distribution of goods and Nigeria is also providing financial support to the most vulnerable people. Balancing the potential for food shortages, social unrest, and economic collapse, other countries, including Malawi and Ghana, have opted for no or only partial lockdowns. It is too early to fully understand the implications of these differing strategies, but the response of Tanzania has raised near universal concern, with no case numbers released for weeks and the endorsement of unproven herbal remedies by President John Magufuli.There is no room for complacency. Medical capacity within Africa will be rapidly overwhelmed if containment fails, but vertical efforts concentrated on this outbreak threaten other hard-won gains. As a result of this pandemic, 80 million children under the age of 1 year worldwide may be at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, as routine immunisations have been disrupted in many countries, including Chad, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The focus on COVID-19 must not detract from continued action in other areas of health. Interrupted vaccination campaigns in DR Congo might have cost more lives than Ebola infection. Repeating this scenario with COVID-19 on a continental scale must be avoided. This pandemic should underline the importance of universal health coverage over narrow responses.Despite a strong regional response, the repercussions of the global COVID-19 pandemic could hinder Africa's capacity to minimise deaths and economic disruption. The closure of international borders, disruption of flights and supply chains, and export bans restrict the ability of African countries to procure personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and essential food items, risking disease spread and famine. Many countries have responded with local solutions, such as development of cheap diagnostic tests in Senegal and establishing local supplies of masks in Ghana. Actions including suspension of tariffs on health-care products, establishment of supply corridors, and the easing of restrictions on food exports recommended by the UN must be adopted quickly. The World Bank estimates that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty by the end of the year. Global market changes will affect exports, including oil and tourism, with a substantial impact in Africa. The UN Secretary-General has called for a comprehensive global response package, including across the board debt standstill and restructuring to support Africa's economic resilience.There is still potential for disaster in Africa, especially as countries begin to ease the strictest lockdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic enforces global power structures. The rest of the world has a role in supporting and enabling an effective and safe response, but as much as Africa faces unique difficulties, it also has unique strengths. There have been many national successes and an effective regional response. Future action needs to be Africa-led and the rest of the world should look to see what can be learned.
The plight of essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic/-/The COVID-19 pandemic has vividly highlighted how much society depends upon essential workers. Praise for the heroic work being done by health-care workers to save lives worldwide in dangerous, exhausting conditions is everywhere. But those same workers are often left unprotected by governments and systems that have failed to supply them with enough personal protective equipment (PPE), supplies, and resources to do their jobs. In April alone, there were an estimated 27 COVID-19-related health worker deaths in the USA, 106 in the UK, and 180 in Russia, with tens of thousands of infections. The actual numbers are probably much higher.But essential work extends beyond health care. Although some people have been able to shift their jobs to their homes, millions of workers have jobs that cannot be done at home—not only custodial staff and orderlies in hospitals, but also teachers and child-care workers, grocery clerks and supermarket workers, delivery people, factory and farm workers, and restaurant staff, often without adequate PPE. These people leave their homes to help maintain a semblance of normality for others, at great risk to themselves and their families.What constitutes an essential worker in the USA varies by state, but black and Latino Americans make up a large part of the essential workforce and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In New York City, over 60% of COVID-19 deaths have been in black and Latino populations. Meat processing plants have become hotspots for transmission, with 700 new cases at a Texas plant on May 16. 81 employees at a Walmart in Massachusetts tested positive for COVID-19 on May 2. Those who would rather quit their jobs than be exposed to a dangerous work situation face a daunting prospect in the USA. 36 million people have filed for unemployment in the past 2 months and quitting a job (even one that is unsafe) would disqualify workers from unemployment insurance benefits. In the UK, 33% (10·6 million people) of the total workforce are deemed key workers according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite a government plan to pay furloughed workers 80% of their salary, many low-wage workers such as cleaners, migrant and seasonal workers, and student labourers might not be eligible.Transport staff have been particularly hard hit. In New York City, 120 employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have died due to COVID-19, and nearly 4000 have tested positive. The MTA changed guidance to advise wearing face masks before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO shifted their guidance, but being exposed to the public, even with adequate PPE, presents dangers. At least 28 London bus drivers have died due to COVID-19, and a UK railway worker, Belly Mujinga, died after being spat on by a passenger who claimed to have COVID-19, leaving behind an 11-year-old daughter.The International Labour Organization has reported that 2·7 billion people—81% of the world's workforce—had been affected by lockdown measures. 61% of workers are from the informal sector, 90% of whom are in low-income and middle-income countries, and social protection measures are often inadequate, with a lack of access to health-care support and economic protections. Informal and migrant workers are likely to fall through the cracks and ensuring their safety must be a priority.Some US states are considering reopening restaurants, bars, gyms, and swimming pools, without a viable system in place to test, trace, and isolate people, and a CDC draft plan to lift the lockdown has been watered down by the Trump administration. In Germany, infection rates rose as lockdown restrictions began to ease and in the UK Boris Johnson's vague, amorphous plan to end lockdown has caused confusion and angered many. Gifted with a 2-month lockdown and a chance to lay the groundwork for a staged, successful reopening, many western leaders have instead prevaricated, shifted blame, and appear not to grasp the dangers of lifting lockdown without robust testing and mitigation strategies in place. The rush towards a premature, ill-advised end to the lockdown risks a second wave of infections that could surpass the first, and essential workers who never got a chance to isolate and consider their health during the first wave will face the greatest risk to their lives.When this pandemic has ended, we cannot allow a return to the status quo ante. We must ensure that essential workers can do their jobs safely, and that they have adequate health care and paid sick leave to safeguard their health beyond extraordinary pandemics. Essential workers are just that—essential—and by protecting their health, we protect the health and wellbeing of us all.For more on the COVID-19 crisis and informal and migrant workers see https://oecd-development-matters.org/2020/04/22/the-covid-19-crisis-income-support-to-informal-workers-is-necessary-and-possible/For more on the COVID-19 crisis and informal and migrant workers see https://oecd-development-matters.org/2020/04/22/the-covid-19-crisis-income-support-to-informal-workers-is-necessary-and-possible/
Lockdown fears for key populations/-/With much of the world's population under COVID-19 lockdown, curfews, and travel restrictions, access to HIV testing and treatment services is a significant concern for people with HIV and those who provide care. Interruptions in supply chains with subsequent stock-outs of antiretrovirals and closure of sexual health clinics and counselling services are already affecting the HIV response in some countries. Correspondence in this issue describes how drug shortages are affecting the HIV response in Indonesia. Many governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have responded with innovative strategies to counter the lockdown, including multimonth dispensing of antiretrovirals, online clinics and support networks, and postal testing for sexually transmitted infections. However, there have been worrying reports about countries and regions abusing the rights of key populations affected by HIV/AIDS under the pretext of COVID-19 regulations.In Egypt, Human Rights Watch (HRW) report that people with HIV are afraid to collect their antiretroviral prescriptions since government infectious disease hospitals, the only centres for HIV treatment, have been designated COVID-19 centres. Provision of HIV services by trusted NGOs has been resisted by government and multimonth prescribing is not encouraged.Also widely reported in the media is the plight of 19 young people staying at a shelter for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people in Kampala, Uganda, who were arrested, beaten, and questioned on their sexual behaviour. They were charged with disobeying COVID-19 regulations on social distancing but were not detained under Uganda's anti-homosexuality law. After 50 days detention, the charges were dropped and the 19 people were released after mounting pressure from human rights groups. Some of those detained have HIV and had no access to their medication during detention.UNAIDS have reported crackdowns against sex workers, including home raids, compulsory COVID-19 testing, arrests, and threatened deportation of migrant sex workers. Criminalised in most jurisdictions, lockdown and social distancing have decimated their livelihoods, and police harassment and criminal penalties endanger sex workers' health. Many government-led social protection schemes have excluded sex workers. Transgender populations have also been impacted by a lack of societal care in many countries. Since lockdown, there have been reports of murders of transgender people in Puerto Rico. And HRW has reported that transgender people (hijra) in Bangladesh, who are poorly provisioned for at the best of times, have little access to food and medication and there are doubts that there will be equitable distribution of emergency resources to this group. Homeless populations too have been severely affected—for example, in Minsk, Belarus, the number of homeless shelters has reduced from 11 to three, reducing the support available for this group, some of whom are living with HIV.Some governments have taken advantage of the COVID-19 emergency to pass laws blatantly penalising some key populations. Hungary passed a law to remove the right of people to change their gender and name to conform with their gender identity; and Poland fast-tracked an update to criminal law that increases the penalties for HIV exposure, non-disclosure, and transmission. UNAIDS and the European Parliament both rightly condemned the abuse of emergency powers in the two countries.Discrimination against the LGBTI community in South Korea threatens the COVID-19 response. Lauded for its approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's tracking and tracing of people linked to an outbreak at a gay nightclub in Seoul has led to an anti-gay backlash, in a country with already entrenched homophobic attitudes. Concerns are that those affected will not get tested for COVID-19 for fear of being outed.
Reviving the US CDC/-/The COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen in the USA with 1·3 million cases and an estimated death toll of 80 684 as of May 12. States that were initially the hardest hit, such as New York and New Jersey, have decelerated the rate of infections and deaths after the implementation of 2 months of lockdown. However, the emergence of new outbreaks in Minnesota, where the stay-at-home order is set to lift in mid-May, and Iowa, which did not enact any restrictions on movement or commerce, has prompted pointed new questions about the inconsistent and incoherent national response to the COVID-19 crisis.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flagship agency for the nation's public health, has seen its role minimised and become an ineffective and nominal adviser in the response to contain the spread of the virus. The strained relationship between the CDC and the federal government was further laid bare when, according to The Washington Post, Deborah Birx, the head of the US COVID-19 Task Force and a former director of the CDC's Global HIV/AIDS Division, cast doubt on the CDC's COVID-19 mortality and case data by reportedly saying: “There is nothing from the CDC that I can trust”. This is an unhelpful statement, but also a shocking indictment of an agency that was once regarded as the gold standard for global disease detection and control. How did an agency that was the first point of contact for many national health authorities facing a public health threat become so ill-prepared to protect the public's health?In the decades following its founding in 1946, the CDC became a national pillar of public health and globally respected. It trained cadres of applied epidemiologists to be deployed in the USA and abroad. CDC scientists have helped to discover new viruses and develop accurate tests for them. CDC support was instrumental in helping WHO to eradicate smallpox. However, funding to the CDC for a long time has been subject to conservative politics that have increasingly eroded the agency's ability to mount effective, evidence-based public health responses. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration resisted providing the sufficient budget that the CDC needed to fight the HIV/AIDS crisis. The George W Bush administration put restrictions on global and domestic HIV prevention and reproductive health programming.The Trump administration further chipped away at the CDC's capacity to combat infectious diseases. CDC staff in China were cut back with the last remaining CDC officer recalled home from the China CDC in July, 2019, leaving an intelligence vacuum when COVID-19 began to emerge. In a press conference on Feb 25, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned US citizens to prepare for major disruptions to movement and everyday life. Messonnier subsequently no longer appeared at White House briefings on COVID-19. More recently, the Trump administration has questioned guidelines that the CDC has provided. These actions have undermined the CDC's leadership and its work during the COVID-19 pandemic.There is no doubt that the CDC has made mistakes, especially on testing in the early stages of the pandemic. The agency was so convinced that it had contained the virus that it retained control of all diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but this was followed by the admission on Feb 12 that the CDC had developed faulty test kits. The USA is still nowhere near able to provide the basic surveillance or laboratory testing infrastructure needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.But punishing the agency by marginalising and hobbling it is not the solution. The Administration is obsessed with magic bullets—vaccines, new medicines, or a hope that the virus will simply disappear. But only a steadfast reliance on basic public health principles, like test, trace, and isolate, will see the emergency brought to an end, and this requires an effective national public health agency. The CDC needs a director who can provide leadership without the threat of being silenced and who has the technical capacity to lead today's complicated effort.The Trump administration's further erosion of the CDC will harm global cooperation in science and public health, as it is trying to do by defunding WHO. A strong CDC is needed to respond to public health threats, both domestic and international, and to help prevent the next inevitable pandemic. Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics.For more on how the CDC's advice has been questioned see https://apnews.com/7a00d5fba3249e573d2ead4bd323a4d4For more on how the CDC's advice has been questioned see https://apnews.com/7a00d5fba3249e573d2ead4bd323a4d4
Riding the coronacoaster of uncertainty/-/Among all the reports, modelling, and desktop exercises in the past decade devoted to preparing for the next pandemic, when COVID-19 spread worldwide, some of the consequences had surely never been predicted. Scientists who were barely known outside a narrow academic circle are now household names, lauded and vilified in turn in the press and on social media. Twitter subscribers who until a few months ago were apparently experts in European relations or constitutional law are now skilled infectious diseases epidemiologists. The accretion of new knowledge takes place via tweets, political grandstanding, gross misinterpretation of preprints, and media briefings in the absence of scrutinisable data. We are witness to the unedifying spectacle of highly respected scientists left squirming as they are subject to the dangerous ramblings of politicians desperate to rescue themselves from their own incompetence. Politically inspired crank conspiracy theories abound as to the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Perhaps more predictably, the steps taken by national governments to mitigate COVID-19 are simultaneously criticised as under-reactions and over-reactions. And as these policies have their desired effect, the premature clamour for a “return to normal” grows ever louder.Whereas policy decisions in response to COVID-19 are labelled as being “guided by the science”, there are many aspects of this disease that affect policy where scientific consensus has yet to form. For example, there has been much discussion of whether immunity from natural infection will protect against repeat infections. Experience with other coronaviruses suggests that although protective immunity does develop, it also wanes. If true for SARS-CoV-2, the effect on policy around so-called “immunity passports” is unclear. At the very least, people who can go about their business because of their immune status will need to be retested frequently.The value of wearing face masks remains unclear in our view. As part of the relaxing of physical distancing restrictions, governments are recommending face covering while on public transport or shopping. Given that we can be confident that domestic and workplace settings are more likely venues for virus transmission than travel or casual urban contact, then, logically, advice to wear facial covering while travelling to work should extend to the workplace itself.Many governments have implemented school closures as part of the pandemic response. The contribution of this measure to transmission control relative to other policies is fiercely disputed. Staged, carefully monitored reopening of schools might be necessary to gather information to guide long-term policy.What was predicted from previous outbreaks is the effect that the response to COVID-19 is having on management of other diseases. In our May issue, we reported that the pandemic has disrupted both routine and mass vaccination campaigns in some low-income and middle-income countries, and the same is now happening with infant immunisation in the USA and the UK. A recent report estimates that compared with a scenario of no pandemic, the demands that the COVID-19 response puts on health systems will increase deaths by up to 10% for HIV, 20% for tuberculosis, and 36% for malaria over 5 years in high-burden settings. The pandemic response is already affecting care for non-communicable diseases, and the resultant economic downturn will have chronic long-term health effects, with mental health perhaps worst affected.Policy responses must account for scientific uncertainties, while at the same time balancing the demands that COVID-19 puts on health-care resources with the long-term economic and health effects of pandemic control measures. Among industrialised, densely populated countries, Germany and South Korea in particular have been praised for their responses to COVID-19, which have been based on widespread testing, contact tracing, and isolation. But the virus has not gone away in these places—there are worrying signs of an increase in cases as restrictions are eased. The percentage of the global population that is immune from exposure to the disease is probably still in single figures; future outbreaks are almost inevitable.A reshaping of policy is required that accounts for a reluctantly forming consensus: that we must plan for COVID-19 over years rather than months. Even with an effective vaccine in the next year, global roll-out will take at least as long again. Policies must be internationally coordinated, as WHO has called for since the disease first appeared, and must recognise that neither abandoning control nor eternal lockdown are healthy options.
COVID-19 in Brazil: “So what?”/-/The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached Latin America later than other continents. The first case recorded in Brazil was on Feb 25, 2020. But now, Brazil has the most cases and deaths in Latin America (105 222 cases and 7288 deaths as of May 4), and these are probably substantial underestimates. Even more worryingly, the doubling of the rate of deaths is estimated at only 5 days and a recent study by Imperial College (London, UK), which analysed the active transmission rate of COVID-19 in 48 countries, showed that Brazil is the country with the highest rate of transmission (R0 of 2·81). Large cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the main hotspots now but there are concerns and early signs that infections are moving inland into smaller cities with inadequate provisions of intensive care beds and ventilators. Yet, perhaps the biggest threat to Brazil's COVID-19 response is its president, Jair Bolsonaro.When asked by journalists last week about the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, he responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?” He not only continues to sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures of physical distancing and lockdown brought in by state governors and city mayors but has also lost two important and influential ministers in the past 3 weeks. First, on April 16, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the respected and well liked Health Minister, was sacked after a television interview, in which he strongly criticised Bolsonaro's actions and called for unity, or else risk leaving the 210 million Brazilians utterly confused. Then on April 24, following the removal of the head of Brazil's federal police by Bolsonaro, Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, one of the most powerful figures of the right-wing government and appointed by Bolsonaro to combat corruption, announced his resignation. Such disarray at the heart of the administration is a deadly distraction in the middle of a public health emergency and is also a stark sign that Brazil's leadership has lost its moral compass, if it ever had one.Even without the vacuum of political actions at federal level, Brazil would have a difficult time to combat COVID-19. About 13 million Brazilians live in favelas, often with more than three people per room and little access to clean water. Physical distancing and hygiene recommendations are near impossible to follow in these environments—many favelas have organised themselves to implement measures as best as possible. Brazil has a large informal employment sector with many sources of income no longer an option. The Indigenous population has been under severe threat even before the COVID-19 outbreak because the government has been ignoring or even encouraging illegal mining and logging in the Amazon rainforest. These loggers and miners now risk bringing COVID-19 to remote populations. An open letter on May 3 by a global coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists, and intellectuals, organised by the Brazilian photojournalist Sebastião Salgado, warns of an impending genocide.What are the health and science community and civil society doing in a country known for its activism and outspoken opposition to injustice and inequity and with health as a constitutional right? Many scientific organisations, such as the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and ABRASCO, have long-opposed Bolsonaro because of severe cuts in the science budget and a more general demolition of social security and public services. In the context of COVID-19, many organisations have launched manifestos aimed at the public—such as Pact for Life and Brazil—and written statements and pleas to government officials calling for unity and joined up solutions. Pot-banging from balconies as protest during presidential announcements happens frequently. There is much research going on, from basic science to epidemiology, and there is rapid production of personal protective equipment, respirators, and testing kits.These are hopeful actions. Yet, leadership at the highest level of government is crucial in quickly averting the worst outcome of this pandemic, as is evident from other countries. In our 2009 Brazil Series, the authors concluded: “The challenge is ultimately political, requiring continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole to secure the right to health for all Brazilian people.” Brazil as a country must come together to give a clear answer to the “So what?” by its President. He needs to drastically change course or must be the next to go.
COVID-19: underlying metabolic health in the spotlight/-/At the time of writing, 3·7 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—have been reported worldwide, resulting in 260 000 deaths. Since the initial cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was first reported on Dec 31, 2019 (and subsequently confirmed to be due to a novel coronavirus), this localised outbreak rapidly transitioned to being declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on Jan 30, 2020, and subsequently a global pandemic as of March 11. Following the initial outbreak in China, 212 countries and territories have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, with Europe and the USA reporting the highest number of cases and deaths. Although transmission of the virus has now been suppressed in China, and the peak of infection passed in Europe and the USA, worrying numbers of cases and deaths are now being reported in Brazil, Russia, India, and many other countries.In the first case series of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan, published on Jan 24, underlying comorbidities were reported in 50% of patients (diabetes [20%], hypertension [15%], and cardiovascular disease [15%]). Subsequently, data from 122 653 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to CDC in the USA between Feb 12 and March 28, showed that approximately one third of patients had at least one underlying condition or risk factor, of which diabetes was the most frequently reported (in 10·9% of cases). Moreover, 78% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 94% of deaths (where complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors was available) occurred in those with at least one underlying health condition. More recently, the first report characterising glycaemic control among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the USA (1122 patients admitted to 88 US hospitals between March 1 and April 6) showed that approximately 40% had diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycaemia on admission, and death rates were more than four times higher among those with diabetes or hyperglycaemia (28·8%) than those without either condition (6·2%). From the available evidence, diabetes (or more broadly poor glycaemic control) is clearly one of the most important comorbidities linked to COVID-19 severity and outcomes. For that reason, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology has recently published practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19, authored by an international panel of experts in the fields of diabetes and endocrinology. The recommendations include much needed guidance on preventing infections in people with diabetes, managing infected patients with diabetes in the ICU, and monitoring of hospitalised (non-ICU) patients for new-onset diabetes—an area of increasing concern.With an estimated 85% of people with type 2 diabetes also having overweight or obesity, and obesity a known risk factor for respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, the impact of BMI on COVID-19 severity and outcomes is of major public health importance. Recently posted data (4103 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients treated at an academic health system in New York City between March 1 and April 2, of whom 1999 were hospitalised) shows that a BMI >40 kg/m2 is one of the strongest predictors of hospitalisation (OR 6·2), behind age ≥75 years (OR 66·8) and age 65–74 years (OR 10·9). As highlighted in the World Obesity Federation Policy Statement, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people living with obesity in many ways, ranging from food shortages and insecurity, reduced opportunities for physical activity during lockdown, anxiety from cancellation of bariatric surgeries, and compounded mental health issues due to the evolving situation and isolation. As people living with obesity are an already vulnerable group, further data is urgently required to determine the risk of COVID-19 severity and outcomes across all BMI categories to provide clear guidance and inform patient care.With COVID-19, we have not just been fighting a communicable disease alone but also a growing backdrop of non-communicable diseases (NCDs; such as diabetes and obesity) that have needlessly raised the death toll. In the aftermath of this pandemic, with the possibility of a global recession, mass unemployment, and a financial deficit that could impact the world for decades, it is perhaps naïve to think that additional resources will be available to improve metabolic health and reduce the burden of NCDs. But that is exactly what needs to happen.
Mental health and COVID-19: change the conversation/-/“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.” This Biblical verse, Matthew 13:12, provides a rare modern-day example of religion informing science—and Science—in the form of sociologist Robert K Merton's article in a 1968 issue of that prestigious journal. Merton proposed the existence of what he called “The Matthew effect” in scientific research: one that “may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known.” He added that this principle might apply not only to individual researchers, but also at an institutional level, and hence that “centers of demonstrated scientific excellence are allocated far larger resources for investigation than centers which have yet to make their mark”. 3 years after Merton, researcher and general practitioner Julian Tudor-Hart published an article on “the inverse care law” in The Lancet. He noted “that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served”.This pattern of advantage fuelling advantage, while disadvantage has a vicious cycle of its own, also applies to patient groups: specifically, people living with severe mental illness. Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the wants and needs of people with diagnoses such as schizophrenia rarely entered into increasing public discussion of mental health issues. Even in professional movements—such as that for global mental health—offering desperately needed help to those experiencing severe mental illness was too often secondary to the more prominent discourse around easily scaled and delivered talking therapies for common mental disorders.Although the COVID-19 situation is frequently described as having changed everything, in some cases it has simply accentuated pre-existing trends—including neglect by the media, the public, and too many professionals of those with severe mental illness. There have been innumerable opinion columns and reports on the mental health effects of lockdown, and on the situation on medical wards and in primary care. But there has been far too little space dedicated to the status of those with severe mental illness who would usually receive community support, or on the problems faced on inpatient mental health units. There are a few honourable exceptions. Sky News in the UK has reported on West London NHS Trust's Avonmore Ward, in which nurses, psychiatrists, and other professionals provide care for individuals with severe mental illness and COVID-19. The difficulties are considerable: measures taken to reduce the risks of viral spread, such as the use of protective clothing and masks, might inadvertently appear threatening to patients experiencing emotional distress and paranoid thoughts, as well as hampering the communication techniques that might otherwise build trust and a positive therapeutic relationship. In the USA, meanwhile, NBC and the New Yorker have provided insights into the risks for both patients and staff in inpatient mental health facilities that might be antiquated and hence difficult to keep clean, and poorly supplied with the equipment and personnel necessary to contain infection. The New Yorker also reported an additional complication of the US system: the “cruel logic of business models and insurance payment”. COVID-19 has brought new challenges: but it has also had an amplifying effect on pre-existing inequities in both society and health services. In mental health care, too many things have been either patched over or left undone for too many years, and the cost of this neglect is now being paid by vulnerable people.There are a few promising signs that change might still be possible. For example, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has issued guidance on the COVID-19 response, new initiatives such as MadCovid are coordinating service user and survivor-led projects, and the Position Paper on mental health research priorities in response to COVID-19 in The Lancet Psychiatry highlights the needs of vulnerable groups, including those with severe mental illness, learning difficulties, and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as socially excluded groups such as prisoners, the homeless, and refugees. But further pressure from clinicians, researchers, service user advocacy organisations, and journalists is needed if societal discourse is to be shifted. The mental health effects of COVID-19 on the general population might be profound and long-lasting, and deserve serious attention; but they cannot be the exclusive focus of conversation. Those who wish to build fairer societies and health systems after the pandemic ends must learn about and prioritise the needs of people living with severe mental illness as a matter of urgency.This online publication has been corrected.

COVID-19: remaking the social contract/-/“Allegiance, after all, has to work two ways; and one can grow weary of an allegiance which is not reciprocal.” The British playwright David Hare quoted this line by the American writer James Baldwin in his recent reflections on the UK Government's response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Baldwin's reminder and warning in the context of civil rights in the mid-20th century USA speak now in the pandemic to communities the world over who are unsure of their governments' allegiances to them. The give-and-take relationship between the state and the individual—perhaps best viewed through the lens of what Enlightenment philosophers termed the social contract—is being strained, its inadequacy exposed, and must surely be remade in the midst of this global health and economic crisis.Governments now ask heavy sacrifices from their people, with around a third of the global population under some form of lockdown. But demonstration that governments are in fact acting to protect the public, for example, through adequately preparing the health system and giving clear advice aimed at saving lives, has been highly variable. Although international comparisons are not straightforward, there are nonetheless encouraging examples of where strong and swift action has succeeded in staving off the worst effects of the virus, be they Germany's quick escalation of testing, New Zealand's elimination strategy, or South Korea's aggressive pursuit of a test-and-trace approach. By contrast, the UK, USA, and Brazil, among others, have been slow to react and haphazard when they did. The serious deficiencies in pandemic planning and response have sparked protests and condemnation and call into question commitment to the most vital interests of the public.Such failures have too often been accompanied by poor transparency and an ingrained resistance to all forms of accountability. In March, when US President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter if he takes responsibility for the delay in making test kits available, he replied “No, I don't take responsibility at all.” And in April, at a daily COVID-19 briefing when UK Home Secretary Priti Patel was asked twice if she would apologise about the shortage of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, she responded, “I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings”, in what seemed to be indifference to the sacrifices being made by health-care workers on behalf of the country and its people.Beyond immediate responses, this pandemic is revealing how a longer-term increase in inequalities and neglect of public services have weakened the ability of societies to deal with external shocks and created new vulnerabilities in a crisis. Racial and ethnic minorities, those with weak employment protections, including migrant workers, and populations without adequate access to affordable health care are among the hardest hit.However, at the same time, COVID-19 is also overturning core values, norms, and rules that sit at the heart of long-standing market-oriented political agendas. The willingness with which nations have put the brakes on their economies to protect lives, coupled with massive increases in public spending and government debt, particularly by conservative administrations, was inconceivable a few months ago. According to one analysis, as of April 23, a staggering 151 countries have planned, introduced, or adapted a total of 684 social protection measures in response to the pandemic.Despite important deficiencies in some responses, in many ways the world is witnessing the setting aside of ideology to address the urgent and fundamental need common to all people—the protection of health. So far, the measures taken have been uneven, short-term, and reactive. But it is hard to imagine that when this pandemic is over, the public will be content to go back to the way things were. That it has taken a crisis of this scale to force the recognition that the basic role of a government is to serve and protect its people—that wellbeing has a higher value than gross domestic product—is a shocking demonstration of how the reciprocal rights and responsibilities that form the basis of so many democratic systems have been hollowed out. The kind of societies that are set to emerge from this pandemic is far from clear, but our interconnectedness and interdependence at local, national, and global levels have never been more undeniable. Nor can the importance of well resourced and well prepared health systems continue to be ignored. A renewed and expanded social contract, one with health at the centre, could well be one legacy of COVID-19.
Race for a COVID-19 vaccine/-/The entire world is united in facing the emergency of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: we are at war, but together against a common enemy. In this battle, health-care workers and researchers fight back against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threat from the clinic and the laboratory. Behavioural and therapeutic strategies are fundamental, as we highlighted in our last editorial, but they must be coupled with the long-term goal of a preventative vaccine.Researchers are working to orchestrate an unprecedented global effort to find a vaccine against COVID-19 in record time. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was established 3 years ago, with the aim of ensuring the world is prepared to deal with new infectious diseases. CEPI is leading efforts to finance and coordinate research on a vaccine for COVID-19 by launching a call for proposals in early February. Several companies and academic institutions working on vaccine candidates answered. CEPI chose eight of them, including Moderna (MA, USA), which, together with US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, launched the first human trial on a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on March 16.The study consists of a safety and immunogenicity phase 1 clinical trial to test mRNA-1273, a novel lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilised spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, in 45 healthy adults. Enrolment begun in Seattle (WA, USA), with Emory University in Atlanta (GA, USA) also recruiting healthy volunteers. On April 14, Moderna stated that the trial is on track and has started enrolling patients to receive the highest dose of the vaccine; there is hope that a phase 2 trial could commence in Spring or early Summer of 2020. The speed of these developments–63 days from sequence selection for mRNA-1273 to the beginning of a human trial for a vaccine candidate– is impressive, owing to both the relentless work of the scientists and the unprecedented demand of the circumstances.Given the genetic similarity of the two coronaviruses, earlier vaccine research done by Moderna for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was useful for the design of mRNA-1273. This similarity granted Moderna a selective advantage. In addition, the candidate from Moderna is an RNA vaccine, developed using a technology that, compared with traditional vaccines methods, is faster, cheaper, and easier to scale-up. Because the vaccine is based on a synthetic RNA molecule that encodes for a single viral protein, it also promises to be safer, as it does not involve the attenuation of live viruses. Finally, in the context of the pandemic, global regulators allowed human trials to run in parallel with animal testing, and so human studies could commence before animal results are available.Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, has chosen to fund a wide range of partners and vaccine technologies to provide the best chance of developing a vaccine that can stop the spread of COVID-19. Besides Moderna, the other candidates funded by CEPI have been developed by both companies and academic institutions. The selected strategies for this race are diverse, as are the stages of research. Common ground for several candidates is that previous knowledge is built on MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but this is not the only element in CEPI's strategy. We can see a clear interest in new technologies: while Moderna and CureVac (Tübingen, Germany) are developing an mRNA-based vaccine, Novavax (MD, USA) is using recombinant protein nanoparticle technology to deliver antigens derived from the viral S protein. Other recombinant vaccine approaches have also been considered. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong (Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong) are using a weakened version of influenza virus that has been altered to express the surface protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the consortium led by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) is adopting a measles vaccine as a vector.The University of Queensland (QLD, Australia) is leveraging on its S-spike vaccine. The candidate has been developed via molecular clamp technology, which uses a lab-created polypeptide to pin the spike protein in its tortile position so that the body's immune system can target it before the virus has a chance to activate. The INO-4800 DNA vaccine, developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals (PA, USA) has been given permission to do a phase 1 clinical trial in 40 volunteers after showing promising results in animals, and the first dosing was delivered on April 6. The University of Oxford (Oxford, UK) has been selected for its ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which is based on an adenoviral vaccine vector already tested and funded by CEPI for other pathogens, including MERS-CoV. After doing animal studies in early March, researchers began recruiting 510 human participants for phase 1 and phase 2 trials on March 27.Outside of CEPI's funded initiatives, researchers are working to develop translationally relevant candidates and solutions, increasing the odds of finding successful vaccines. Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute (Guangdong, China) is testing two cellular candidates in phase 1 trials of 100 participants each. Both vaccines use lentiviral vector systems to modify cells to express viral genes and activate T-cells; Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is based on modified artificial antigen presenting cells, whereas the second candidate, LV-SMENP-DC, modifies dendritic cells. CanSino Biologics (Tianjin, China) initiated a phase 1 safety trial on March 18, recruiting 108 participants in Wuhan (China) to test a recombinant adenovirus vaccine candidate, Ad5-nCoV. On April 12, they moved to a phase 2 trial, that will enrol 500 participants.Several lines of preclinical research are also progressing quickly. Andrea Gambotto and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (PA, USA) published a preclinical study in EBioMedicine on April 2, showing promising results on animals for the PittCoVacc candidate, built using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. The study also tested a novel delivering method, a microneedle array with biodegradable needles that deliver the spike protein pieces into the skin, to increase potency and scalability.The race for a vaccine moves fast, as the need for a solution is evident, but we cannot forget that safety is of the highest importance. Previous work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has contributed to the rapidity of design and development of candidates, whose common goal is to elicit polyclonal antibody responses against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralise viral infection. But reasons for concern have arisen too. In vitro and few in vivo studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have suggested that antibodies against the virus could cause immune-enhanced disease, either by enhancing infection into target cells, or by increasing inflammation and severity of pulmonary disease. This issue raises the possibility that similar events might occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eng Eong Ooi and colleagues from Duke-NUS Medical School (Singapore) describe in a review in Press at EBioMedicine the potential effect of such risk, and the importance of adopting strategies for mitigating the risks right at the outset while developing vaccines or therapeutic antibodies.While vaccine development research continues, questions are already arising on the next steps and challenges, concerning the manufacturing, distribution, and widespread accessibility of a possible vaccine. Some strategies are already being considered: Sandy Douglas at the University of Oxford, for example, is leading the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine manufacturing scale-up project. Working immediately on large-scale production could accelerate the availability of a high-quality and safe vaccine when the right candidate is there.Of course, once an effective vaccine is available, it will be of the upmost importance to provide affordable and accessible protection from COVID-19 for all who need it. Right now, we celebrate the efforts of scientists, doctors, and individuals working around the clock to find a solution to this pandemic.
The future belongs to the globalists/-/In a matter of 6 months the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the world as we knew it, affected our normal social, economic, and health-care systems and changed the way we viewed infectious disease and spread. The estimated global mortality from COVID-19 has passed the 300 000 mark and, in an effort to save lives, the resultant lockdowns and travel bans have caused economies to suffer their most severe contractions in the first quarter of the year in more than a decade. As governments look to lifting restrictions in hopes of rebolstering the economy and returning societies to normal, we ask, should we be striving for normality as we knew it?On the rise of right-wing nationalistic politics, where many countries looked to isolate themselves, such as US President Donald Trump's America first campaign or Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how the world is indisputably connected. The extent of connectedness was portrayed in the unprecedented speed at which the virus spread. China notified WHO about a cluster of pneumonia-like cases on Dec 31, 2019, and on Jan 13, 2020, the first confirmed case outside of China was declared in Thailand, and the first European case in France on Jan 24, 2020. With reported cases in at least 187 countries, many of which do not have the health-care facilities or government infrastructure to handle COVID-19, the need for a more global outlook and strategy is becoming apparent. China now reports more imported cases of COVID-19 than locally transmitted cases, and as travel bans begin to ease, fears of a second wave of infection are appearing, unless all countries can contain the virus.Collaboration and solidarity between countries is not always guaranteed. As Italy became the new epicentre of the disease, the EU failed to respond to the country's request for aid via the bloc's emergency mechanism, as countries imposed their own restrictions, banned the export of medical supplies, and were uncoordinated in their approach. On April 16, 2020, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, addressed the EU parliament and issued a “heartfelt apology” on behalf of Europe for their “only-for-me” response, and admitted they did not stand by Italy when they needed it. The European Commission laid out their new plans, including locating up to €100 billion to the hardest-hit countries, starting with Italy and loans guaranteed by all member states to show Europe's solidarity. The UK Government has also been accused of prioritising country politics over intercountry cooperation, because they failed to join the EU emergency scheme, initiated by the European Commission, which uses the bulk-buying power of the 500 million-person single market to get priority for ventilators and protective equipment. Mounting criticism led to a reversal in approach, with a spokesperson reporting that the government will now consider participating in future procurement schemes. These delays reflect the sometimes reluctant departure from prepandemic ideologies in favour of a more unified approach—a majority of the time because of increasing criticism and a demand for better management.The COVID-19 pandemic has not only highlighted the insufficient response of international aid, but also the inabilities of individual countries to deal with a health crisis. Despite COVID-19 initially hitting developed and wealthy nations, health-care systems struggled to cope with the increase in demand, with only a few countries able to contain the virus and flatten their curve before catastrophic death tolls. In many cases, this success is strongly correlated to the strength of a country's health-care system, as seen in the 2019 Legatum Prosperity Index which measures economic and social prosperity policies and conditions based on 12 pillars in 167 nations. Among those ranked in the top ten in the health pillar—a specific measurement looking at the extent to which people in each country are healthy and have access to services—are Singapore (1st), Japan (2nd), South Korea (4th), and Hong Kong (6th). With a population of 41 million, South Korea has 11 065 cases and 263 deaths attributed to COVID-19. Alongside mass testing and contact tracing, the South Korean health-care system was particularly prepared after being criticised for their management of the Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015 which led to the largest outbreak outside the Middle East. The system is funded by a compulsory National Health Insurance Scheme that covers 97% of the population. Germany, which has managed to maintain a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than most of its neighbouring countries, ranked 12th and in the past has been criticised for having too many hospitals. Before the crisis Germany had 33 · 9 intensive care beds per 100 000 people, compared with 9 · 7 in Spain and 8 · 6 in Italy. Universal health coverage of some kind seems imperative in managing and treating the majority of the population, and countries that have done little in the past to strengthen their health system, such as the USA, have been those most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 has highlighted what is truly necessary and important to be an advanced and successful country, because, ultimately, the health and welfare of all members of society should be valued, funded, and appreciated.COVID-19 has disrupted the world and has challenged the infrastructure of global society. The previous economic and political constructs that seemed immovable and constant have fallen, but with that, an opportunity to re-evaluate what we want to prioritise as a civilisation has risen. Health care as a basic human right has never been more apparent, as has the lack of funding of the health-care sector in many countries. Financial instability and fear have historically contributed to feelings of xenophobia and hate, and with COVID-19 we have seen the rise of hate crimes against minority groups and racist vitriol. In September 2019, US President Donald Trump claimed to the UN General Assembly that “the future doesn't belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.” However, now more than ever, the need to reject these ideologies is imperative when our personal safety is reliant on the health and safety of others, and the marginalisation of any sector of society will only lead to more chaos and disruption. Life as we knew it has shown to be unsustainable, unsafe, and unjustifiable, and now our survival depends on our ability to learn and evolve.
Safeguarding cancer care in a post-COVID-19 world/-/As the world comes to grips with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reports are emerging on how cancer care is being deprioritised, delayed, and discontinued. These decisions made under the duress of the pandemic will have grave consequences for cancer mortality for years to come.Those recently diagnosed with cancer, or in the midst of cancer treatment, are facing disruption for all but the most urgent procedures because of concerns about their susceptibility to the serious risks of COVID-19, and the redeployment of personnel, beds, and equipment to COVID-19 wards. Hospital capacity has also been depleted due to COVID-19 cases in health-care workers themselves, and oncologists have not been spared. Official advice is that urgent cancer care can continue, but other treatments should be rationed and adapted. These decisions, however, are inconsistent, and not evidence-based—multidisciplinary teams are being put in the unenviable position of making best guesses for each patient. However, treatment delays and adaptations can risk, for example, operable or curable cancers developing into inoperable disease with a far worse prognosis. In many cases, and especially in resource-constrained settings, balancing the risks of undertreatment with those of COVID-19 infection will lead to situations where there is no obvious best course of action. As societies and governments scramble to provide guidelines for patients with cancer, frontline medical staff are being forced to make on-the-fly treatment decisions, and, unfortunately, many patients will receive suboptimal care.Importantly, cancer screening and diagnosis is also being affected by reprioritisation of health-care services during the pandemic. For example, in the UK, urgent suspected cancer referrals normally eligible for the 2-week wait target are now subject to prioritisation rules that will cause delays. Additionally, because UK screening programmes have been suspended, diagnoses will depend on presentation of patients with cancer symptoms. Worries about spreading and contracting COVID-19, and fear that COVID-19 is rampant in hospitals and other health-care facilities, might dissuade patients with symptoms from contacting their family doctors. Delayed cancer diagnoses during the next weeks and months risks many thousands of cases going undetected and untreated. Knock-on effects, related to a surge in demand for cancer-related services once the pandemic has passed its peak, coupled with an increase in advanced-stage cancers due to diagnostic delays and under treatment, could overwhelm health services and contribute to an excess in cancer-related mortality in the coming years.The pandemic is also affecting patients with cancer who are in follow up—for example, those in remission or receiving palliative care for late-stage disease. Cancer surveillance and management of cancer-related symptoms and treatment sequelae are managed by primary care physicians in many countries, or as home-based or outpatient services. However, the pandemic has restricted access to just the types of resources these patients need—in-home health-care workers, primary care appointments, and supportive care medications. Because appropriate and timely supportive care can extend overall survival, availability of these services is crucial to prevent not only morbidity, but also premature death.Overall, disruption to the full spectrum of medical cancer care services will undoubtedly have a large effect on cancer-related mortality. A 5–10% decrease in survival in high-income countries has been predicted, which will account for hundreds of thousands of excess deaths, dwarfing those caused by COVID-19—but we are missing precise data on mortality that can be used to anticipate future cancer care needs. Therefore, we call for research into the long-term impact on cancer-related mortality resulting from cancer care decisions being made globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we advocate that pandemic preparedness plans must account for the resources needed to maintain high-quality, evidence-based continuity of care of people with cancer, including workforce and service capacity needs, and a robust referral and diagnostics service. Oncologists must be included in the group of care workers who require essential equipment and resources during a pandemic. Whether governments and health services could have been better prepared for COVID-19 is debatable, but the need for a quickly deployable, and evidence-based, response is urgent and unmet. The next pandemic is not hypothetical—it will happen again—and guidance must be generated now to prevent patients with cancer becoming collateral damage.For more on cancer treatment guidelines during COVID-19 see Comment page 619, and https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0119-_Maintaining-cancer-services-_-letter-to-trusts.pdf

Decolonising COVID-19/-/When WHO added Disease X to its R&D Blueprint in 2018, the reality of an unknown pathogen that could cause a serious international epidemic was just beyond the limits of the imagination. 2 years later, at the time of writing this Editorial—the beginning of April, 2020—over 1 million people around the world have been infected with COVID-19 virus and 80 000 people have died from the disease. One-third of the world's population is in lockdown. As the world's most advanced economies struggle to repurpose state and private sector capacity to meet the growing demands on health services, the spotlight is shifting to countries without formal social safety nets or the massive monetary injections needed to bolster their economies.COVID-19 is yet to establish a firm foothold in low-income nations, but African countries are already feeling the economic impact of the stall in global demand for oil, gas, and commodity products. UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10 000 population. UNDP has called on the international community to pool resources to not only support the public health response but also to prevent economic collapse in the poorest countries. Similarly, the African Development Bank has appealed for a globally coordinated fiscal stimulus. The UN Economic Commission for Africa's Executive Secretary, Vera Songwe, expressed her disappointment at the global response with a reminder that, “If one of us has the virus – all of us have it.”But with many borders closed and wealthy nations increasingly looking inwards, we are reminded of the asymmetrical power structures that still dominate the largely high-income-country concept of global health and development, and the dangers of the poorest countries being left in the dark as traditional powers shift their focus to the overwhelming problems at home. “The global health model is based in large part on technical assistance and capacity building by the US, the UK, and other rich countries, whose response has been sclerotic and delayed at best”, wrote Sarah Dalglish in a letter to The Lancet in March. Criticising the established notion of global health expertise being concentrated in legacy powers and historically rich states, she laments that “relatively little has been heard from African veterans of the Ebola epidemics in west and central Africa”.The scientific community has fervently responded to the call for a treatment for COVID-19, with the first results of Gilead's experimental antiviral, remdesivir, due to be released this month. However, in the rush to register trials—over 300 so far—a sinister undercurrent has re-emerged. At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about COVID-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first “where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation”, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes “because we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves”.Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, “To be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine…The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.”
Isolation and inclusion/-/The COVID-19 crisis will touch the life of everyone in some way. While viral transmission, incubation times, and care of severely affected patients rightly dominate the news, it is heartening that mental health is given plenty of airtime. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are to be expected in times of stress. Concerns more specific to the COVID-19 outbreak that might have more lasting consequences are the features that prevent health-care staff, carers, and families from having personal contact with patients: working from behind a mask, limiting physical interaction, and not being able to visit ill relatives. Bereavement will be particularly painful without the chance to say goodbye. Children seem to be least affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2, but might experience adverse effects from missing school and being confined indoors.The National Health Commission of China acknowledged these burdens in January, when it published a list of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions. This list was informed by the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak, and recommended that mental health care should be provided for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care professionals caring for them, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, and families and friends of affected people. Doctors highlighted various other groups at risk of mental distress, such as older people, or pregnant women, but it soon became clear that risk pertained to everyone.What about people already living with mental health disorders, who are all especially vulnerable in times of crisis, but in different ways? Crucial mental health services are generally being protected from closure and reassignment of staff to treat patients with COVID-19—eg, in Lombardy, Italy, the regional authority specified that mental health and substance misuse services should maintain full functionality. The reassessment of services recommended by Armando D'Agostino and colleagues for their hospital in Milan illustrates practical ways to optimise use of resources, such as closure of certain specialist outpatient units, use of technology for remote consultations, encouraging longer-term prescriptions, and identifying patients with comorbidities that put them at risk from infection with SARS-CoV-2 and contacting them to ensure they understand how to adhere to social isolation requirements.From perspective, many who would not have previously considered their mental health as part of their identity now find that they have common experiences with those living with mental illness and confined to home by social anxiety, OCD, or agoraphobia. Many of the adjustments to working life echo calls made for years by disability activists. In the UK, recent legal changes reflect this possible reduction in otherness experienced by those living with mental illness, with the Coronavirus Act 2020 assigning police powers of detention and compulsory assessment over people they suspect of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Full parity between mental and physical illness is not achieved, because the Coronavirus Act does not extend to compulsory treatment, but the Act might prompt some to reflect on the implications of involuntary treatment for mental health disorders.Like many things in these days of change, psychotherapy services are moving online far faster than anyone could have envisaged only weeks ago. While it might work for established patients, the application of telemedicine to new patients is a less certain prospect. Remote sessions are also easier for some types of psychotherapy than for others. John Markowitz describes the challenges for interpersonal psychotherapy and guidance on how to overcome these. It would be good to embed research projects around such new ways of working, to assess feasibility, efficacy, and above all acceptability. Are they a temporary means to an end or the sign of things to come?In times of crisis, research might seem a low priority, but as with all crises, it is essential that we monitor innovations and collect high-quality data so that, at a later date, we can learn what worked and what did not. Such research must be done, as far as possible, according to normal standards and complying with ethical best practice. It is also important that the invaluable resources of longitudinal cohort studies around the world are maintained as much as possible, because they will be essential when we have time to examine the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for our mental health. Our world of social isolation has never been so inclusive: once the pandemic has passed, may the benefits endure and the disadvantages fade away.For the National Health Commission of China announcement (in Chinese) see www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/6adc08b966594253b2b791be5c3b9467.shtmlFor the National Health Commission of China announcement (in Chinese) see www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202001/6adc08b966594253b2b791be5c3b9467.shtml
COVID-19 puts societies to the test/-/As of April 21, the coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 2·3 million people and taken 162 956 lives—35 884 in the USA, 24 114 in Italy, 20 852 in Spain, 20 233 in France, 16 509 in the UK, 5209 in Iran, 4642 in China—all underestimates most probably. Beyond these numbers are people, families, communities, societies that have been affected in unprecedented ways. The coronavirus pandemic puts societies to the test: it is a test of political leadership, of national health systems, of social care services, of solidarity, of the social contract—a test of our very own fabric. In the face of this enormous challenge we risk deepening already stark health and social inequalities.In this issue of The Lancet Public Health, a series of research Articles, Comments, and letters tackle some of the most pressing issues in the response to the coronavirus outbreak. The disease and its societal consequences pose enhanced risks to already vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and people living with disability, as Richard Armitage and Laura Nellums point out in their letters, the detained, as noted by Allen Keller and Benjamin Wagner, migrants and refugees, homeless people and children living in temporary accommodation, as Diana Rosenthal and colleagues note in their piece. Risk of infection and mortality is higher for individuals with underlying health conditions and comorbidities and might be so for socioeconomically disadvantaged people and ethnic and racial minority groups. For Faheem Ahmed and colleagues, inequality has aided the spread of COVID-19. In the USA, for example, African Americans are disproportionately affected by the outbreak. The response to COVID-19 cannot be a success without an equity lens to mitigate these health inequalities.To contain the outbreak and prevent a health system overload, isolation, school closures, and lockdown measures have been imposed in many countries, with social and economic consequences and effects on mental and physical health, which are still to be fully evaluated. The consequences for vulnerable groups are a concern and for children in particular. For Wim Van Lancker and Zachary Parolin, school closures could affect poor children through food insecurity and worse educational outcomes in particular. They warn that “While learning might continue unimpeded for children from higher-income households, children from lower-income households are likely to struggle to complete homework and online courses because of their precarious housing situations”…“[T]he current health crisis could become a social crisis that will have long-lasting consequences for children in low-income families.” For UNICEF, without urgent action, this health crisis risks becoming a “child-rights crisis”. Child protection is at stake. With the disruption imposed on communities and families, children already at risk of violence and abuse will find themselves even more vulnerable. Domestic violence is also on the rise. In the first weeks of the lockdown, emergency numbers for domestic violence recorded an 18% increase in calls in Spain and a 30% increase in France. The public health response to COVID-19 must safeguard people in the community.Looking to the future, low-income families could also face the hardship of the economic recession that is likely to follow the pandemic. “Previous recessions have exacerbated levels of child poverty with long-lasting consequences for children's health, wellbeing, and learning outcomes” note Van Lancker and Parolin in their Comment. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests that for each percentage point reduction in the global economy, 10 million people could fall into poverty worldwide. Social security and welfare safety nets will be severely tested. Governments should avoid repeating the mistakes of the austerity policies that followed the 2008 financial crisis, which have affected the resilience of the health systems in Spain (according to Helena Legido-Quigley and colleagues' Comment) and Italy (as noted by Benedetta Armocida and colleagues).The potential fallout of an economic downturn on physical and mental health are likely to be profound but they are not inevitable. By identifying and ensuring that the most at risk are protected, government measures will be crucial in mitigating widening inequalities and public health consequences. For Amartya Sen, writing in The Financial Times on April 15 about the policies enacted so far, “equity has not been a particularly noticeable priority”, still a better society can emerge from the lockdowns. The world has paused—there is an opportunity to invest in social protection, to prioritise policies to reduce inequalities, and to give equity a particularly noticeable priority.
Post-COVID-19 spending/-/The majority of countries have instigated some form of lockdown in order to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Governments seem rather reluctant to discuss what will come next. Presumably this is because they are prioritising clarity of message over information dissemination. Clearly there is a balance to be struck between the provision of accurate and concise information about the current situation and the more speculative scenario exercises needed to plan for an exit strategy. Nevertheless, how long lockdowns continue and how governments go about helping the economy to recover matters a great deal and so inevitably there is much speculation anyway. A lack of government transparency therefore seems unhelpful and only fuels the sense of there being no light at the end of the lockdown tunnel. We are all wondering, when we do emerge into the light, what the world might look like. Much of the answer will depend on how soon restrictions lift and how and where governments choose to spend.The issue attracting most interest at the moment is, understandably, how long lockdowns will last and the extent of the damage this might do to the economy. The narrative being that at some point the treatment (lockdowns and associated economic damages) could become worse than the disease itself (COVID-19). This is of course an immensely difficult question to answer, but if we stick with minimising lives lost as the metric of success for the time being, is there a risk that a deep recession will cost more lives than we save from maintaining lockdowns? The available evidence here is perhaps surprising. Although severe downturns in the economy have historically increased deaths in some groups, as we might expect, the net effect, at least in rich countries, has been a reduction in deaths during recession. This counterintuitive effect is surprisingly consistent across recessions, even quite severe ones. We also know that reductions in pollution are potentially averting many deaths as a result of lockdown (see Comment by Kai Chen), something that does not occur to anything like the same extent in a typical recession and is likely to further bolster reductions in lives lost.Inevitably recessions hit the vulnerable and marginalised hardest, and so extended reductions in economic activity from lockdowns are also expected to hit low-income and vulnerable groups hardest. History does show, however, that this too is not inevitable and nations and administrations with effective social care programmes have been able to reduce the impact of economic downturns on death rates in the past, indicating that such programmes must be a vital part of recovery planning. Clearly, we need to minimise the economic harms done by lockdown, but the evidence doesn't suggest there is a simple trade-off between lives lost to recession against lives lost to COVID-19 as it is frequently framed in the media.More important than how long the lockdowns and reduced economic activity persist is how governments seek to stimulate recovery. This will have clear implications for how damaging the economic recession is to people's lives and how well we are able to respond to the other critical challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss which are no less pressing as a result of the pandemic. Lockdowns have given us some first-hand insight into what cleaner cities might look like and greenhouse gas emissions have fallen, though not by as much as people might think. These gains could catalyse action for cleaner cities and better active transport networks, but nobody would credibly argue that extreme recession is a desirable way to achieve these benefits. Such gains can only be sustainably achieved by changing our investments towards low-carbon infrastructure, transport and lifestyles.The COVID-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call that our global economy is far less robust to shocks than we have become accustomed to believing. Although much could have been handled better in hindsight, most governments have shown real bravery and decisiveness in taking us into lockdown to save lives. However, this is just the start of the story, they must now show just as much bravery and decisiveness in structuring a recovery that moves us purposefully towards low carbon, cleaner, and more resilient infrastructure and lifestyles with appropriate social care provisions for those most harmed by lockdown. It will be tempting to grasp for old approaches to economic recovery, stimulating dirty polluting industries and consumption-fuelled growth, but if we are to find any benefit from this pandemic we must invest differently to prevent and prepare for the other challenges we still face.
India under COVID-19 lockdown/-/The largest COVID-19 national lockdown in the world has been extended to May 3. As of April 22, India has reported 18 985 confirmed cases and 603 deaths from COVID-19 in 31 states and union territories since its first case on Jan 30. India was quick to close its international borders and enforce an immediate lockdown, which WHO praised as “tough and timely”. The lockdown has also given the government time to prepare for a possible surge in cases when the pandemic is forecasted to peak in the coming weeks. Still, India's population of 1·3 billion across diverse states, health inequalities, widening economic and social disparities, and distinct cultural values present unique challenges.Preparedness and response to COVID-19 have differed at the state level. Kerala has drawn on its experience with the Nipah virus in 2018 to use extensive testing, contact tracing, and community mobilisation to contain the virus and maintain a very low mortality rate. It has also set up thousands of temporary shelters for migrant workers. Odisha's exposure to previous natural disasters meant crisis precautions were already in place and have been repurposed. Maharashtra has used drones to monitor physical distancing during lockdown and applied a cluster containment strategy: if three or more patients are diagnosed, all houses within 3 km are surveyed to detect further cases, trace contacts, and raise awareness. Whether this strategy will be successful is still unclear. The premise relies on there not being community transmission, and there is danger of stigmatisation and coercion. But states deserve much of the credit for India's COVID-19 response.The government's sudden enforcement of the lockdown seemed hastily prepared and immediately disadvantaged already vulnerable populations. There has been a mass exodus of migrant workers and concerns are rising about starvation among people who work in the informal economy. Implementing public health measures is difficult in places with overcrowded living conditions and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Non-COVID-19 health services have been disrupted. Reports suggest that the government's efforts to provide financial support and a measure of food security to ease these pressures will be insufficient to meet demand. But better planning and communication could have helped avert this crisis.Rates of testing have been low (0·28 per 1000 people as of April 20). Capacity issues, absence of political will, and operational feasibility have been to blame. However, efforts to reverse the situation are underway as hundreds of thousands of testing kits have become available, and more testing companies and laboratories have been approved. Testing needs to be expanded exponentially as well as strategically as a tool to provide epidemiological evidence. India's response has also been constrained by a shortage of health workers, but this should be remedied by new reforms that would mobilise additional health-care workers from different sources.One threat to the COVID-19 response in India is the spread of misinformation driven by fear, stigma, and blame. There have been rising levels of violence against health-care workers and stigmatisation of people with or suspected of having COVID-19, which could impede reporting of illness. The pandemic has also been used to fan anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, after a gathering connected to the group Tablighi Jamaat was identified as being responsible for many cases. A welcome initiative to combat fake news is being led by a group of more than 400 multidisciplinary Indian scientists, who have voluntarily formed Indian Scientists' Response to COVID-19 to fight myths and misinformation about the disease.In India's favour are its young population (65% aged <35 years) and, to date, a less severe pandemic than was feared. The lockdown is already having the desired effect of flattening the epidemic curve. From April 20, states began easing restrictions on the basis of district profiling of infection hotspots (a form of cluster containment). The immediate challenge is to keep infections at manageable levels and ensure the ability to test, trace contacts, isolate patients, implement COVID care plans, and disseminate timely information. The central government should loosen its control and give states more autonomy over their funding and decision making. India must also pay much greater attention to the health sector and recognise the importance of having strong public sector capacity, especially in primary care and at the district level. India's public health-care system is chronically underfunded (at just 1·28% of GDP), leaving primary care weak. This pandemic could be the much needed wake-up call to the necessity of long-term changes to India's health system.
When pandemics collide/-/One pandemic virus has been a major topic in global health for almost 40 years, the other was discovered just 4 months ago, but, as SARS-CoV-2 infections have now been reported in most African countries, HIV and COVID-19 are on a collision course. Although we have learned a remarkable amount about SARS-CoV-2 in a short time, its potential impact on people living with HIV and on health systems in settings with high HIV burdens is becoming a major concern.Organisations including UNAIDS, UNICEF, and the International AIDS Society have begun to issue guidance and advice on how to deal with COVID-19 in high HIV burden settings. The Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria has also urged recipients to divert surplus funds to prepare and respond to COVID-19. We do know, however, that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is compromising HIV programmes. As global travel and transport are disrupted, drug supply chains are jeopardised. In a Comment, Weiming Tang and colleagues highlight the contributions of non-governmental organisations stepping in to ensure consistency in HIV care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.In Nigeria, as reported in a Feature by Paul Adepoju, the threat of SARS-CoV-2 is already having an effect on HIV and tuberculosis responses as patients choose to social distance by not going to health-care centres to collect drugs. Patients with tuberculosis in Ibadan have been reluctant to travel to collect drugs owing to the overlapping symptoms of tuberculosis and COVID-19. Indeed, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 will be complicated by the high prevalence of tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and cryptococcosis associated with high burdens of HIV—all of which may have respiratory or imaging characteristics that overlap with the new disease. For care providers in the region, this will be a challenge not yet experienced in other settings.The responses to COVID-19 in low-resource, high HIV burden settings will necessarily be different from those in the high-resource settings largely affected so far; but a history of adapting to diverse and shifting HIV epidemics in adverse conditions should enable creative solutions to SARs-CoV-2 across sub-Saharan Africa. As James Hargreaves and colleagues point out in their Comment, despite the differences between the viruses, the HIV response has lessons for the COVID-19 response.At the time of writing, sub-Saharan Africa has reported relatively few cases: several thousand in South Africa and just tens or hundreds in other countries. However, these numbers are probably substantial underestimates owing to limited testing capacity. A unifying factor of the countries that have managed to suppress SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks rapidly is large-scale testing and contact tracing. Where those facilities are not possible, sentinel testing to identify the worst affected areas might be one solution to make the most of limited resources.South Africa acted rapidly by imposing a lockdown, banning the sale of alcohol and taking homeless people into facilities where they could be observed and where substance-use issues among the homeless can be managed. But social distancing is not always possible; many people in high HIV burden settings live in densely populated, cramped housing with limited access to sanitation. To help reduce transmission, Kenya has banned public gatherings, made the wearing of masks mandatory in public, imposed curfews, and set up isolation and quarantine centres for people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and their contacts, respectively.Multimonth dispensing of antiretrovirals has been a topic of interest in recent years: in Kenya, South Africa, and elsewhere, provision of 3 month or even 6 month supplies of antiretrovirals at one time as a response to COVID-19 is becoming the norm to reduce clinical contacts and to facilitate social distancing.
Reflecting on World Asthma Day in the era of COVID-19/-/On May 2, 2020, World Asthma Day will again focus on the needs of people with asthma across the globe. Previous themes have included managing asthma and living with the disease. These themes resonate more than ever this year, as any discussions are likely to be dominated by current debates in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects on asthma care and management.In fact, the risk of infection, and of severe disease once infected, has been a major topic of debate among patients with asthma during the pandemic. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in respiratory manifestations such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it was predicted that patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) would be more vulnerable both to infection and to subsequent severe disease. However, a Comment published in the journal suggests that the prevalence of CRDs, including asthma, among patients with COVID-19 might be lower than that expected from population levels of these diseases. The authors speculate that the lower reported prevalence might be due to underdiagnosis or lack of recognition of CRDs in those with COVID-19, effects of differing immune responses elicited by CRDs, or a protective effect of inhaled corticosteroids. The New York Times noted that asthma did not appear in the top ten comorbidities in patient fatality data from the Department of Health. COPD is listed as eighth, probably due to the age and frailty of this population, but again featuring further down the list than might be expected when compared with rankings in Global Burden of Disease data. However, evidence for an effect of CRDs or their treatment on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or on the course of COVID-19 is currently weak—predominantly in highly selected populations, such as hospitalised patients with severe disease—and is constantly evolving.A Comment published in The Lancet suggested that steroids might be harmful in patients with COVID-19, but stressed that available data are limited. The data do not relate to patients with asthma and should not result in a change in management. The AAAAI and several lung disease organisations reiterated that patients should remain on their current medications because experiencing an exacerbation event and the need for hospitalisation, in those who become poorly controlled, could actually increase patient exposure and the risk of infection. Data are scarce for patients with severe asthma, so any additional guidance for this group is welcome, especially ahead of the forthcoming allergy season. NICE has provided COVID-specific rapid guidance for severe asthma, with five areas for consideration: communicating with patients and minimising risk, investigations, treatment, equipment, and modifications to usual care. Furthermore, the NHS has provided a guide for the management of respiratory patients during the pandemic.Ahead of World Asthma Day, it is easy to overlook the substantial progress that has been made in asthma management in these challenging times. Personalised medicine now plays a large part in asthma care, and concepts such as treatable traits have been folded into patient management. Although the current focus is quite rightly on the pandemic, funders should ensure that there is continued investment for future research and treatment efforts, especially given that support for respiratory diseases has traditionally been underfunded for multifactorial reasons, not least the blame culture that is associated with smoking as a major risk factor for many CRDs and lung cancer. Data related to smoking and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been somewhat contradictory, but the association between smoking and an increased risk of respiratory disease is clear. Research efforts to control smoking, and monitor e-cigarette use in light of the recent EVALI cases, should therefore be safeguarded so that they can be kickstarted again once this pandemic has passed. President Trump's withdrawal of funding to WHO in a knee-jerk reaction during an unprecedented time of global crisis—an action that has quite rightly been described as a “crime against humanity”—should prompt worldwide condemnation. As a result of this decision, vital research to tackle smoking and CRDs is likely to be impacted.The world will look very different in a year's time, but positives can be noted: the spirit of international collaboration and breaking down of geographical barriers, widespread sharing of data, and the global appreciation of dedicated health-care workers and frontline staff. These aspects will inform the core discussions on this forthcoming, and the next, World Asthma Day.
COVID-19 in the USA: a question of time/-/With more than 600 000 confirmed cases and close to 27 000 deaths, the USA has become the current centre of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Fewer than 3 months have elapsed since the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Washington State was confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Initially appearing slow moving and constrained in contrast to the scale of outbreaks in China and Italy, COVID-19 has given way to a nationwide public health catastrophe. For the first time in US history, a disaster declaration has been put in place for all 50 states and most US territories, and 95% of Americans are at least temporarily under some form of stay at home order. The increasing gravity of the situation in the USA has drawn public health and infectious disease experts, policy makers, and partisans across state and federal government into a fitful clash for control and direction of the COVID-19 response. Putting the USA at odds with the international community and global pandemic strategy efforts, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw funding from WHO (about 22% of its budget). Caught amid the chaos are the American people grappling with the fear of a deadly and poorly understood virus, conflicting messaging around their protection and safety, fear of financial fallout, absence of a cohesive national strategy, and volatile, incompetent leadership.As Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has suggested, sluggish decision making by the federal government at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis lost precious time: had “you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives”. It was not until late February, 2020, after local transmission of COVID-19 was established in additional clusters in Oregon and New York states, that the CDC updated guidance to authorise testing for individuals who had not travelled recently, substantially widening the scope of cases that could be detected. During the brief window when containment of the virus might have been a possibility, the CDC retained control of all testing, preventing external academic and commercial test development, and processing only about 100 samples per day. The US Food and Drug Administration has also created barriers through its requisite approval scheme for all diagnostics. Even with the slow scale-up of testing, private facilities and laboratories tasked with processing samples have been severely overwhelmed with thousands of backlogged cases. Point-of-care and clinic testing for active infections is still pressing, especially in regions where outbreaks are predicted to occur, but there must now be a shift in urgency to develop and expand testing capacity for previous COVID-19 infections.Testing might rely on the ability to innovate, but simple and effective prophylaxis against COVID-19 has been hampered and delayed by Trump's prevarication. Dynamic models predicting the rates of mortality and hospital admission, such as the IHME COVID-19 projections as well as previous pandemic preparedness plans, have been available to help states get ready for surge responses, through increasing the number of hospital beds and ventilators available. Yet shortages and inadequate personal protective equipment have and continue to put front-line health-care workers at great risk. After sparring with governors over access to the Strategic National Stockpile, Trump has not invoked the Defense Production Act, ordering private businesses to manufacture needed goods, leaving states, philanthropists, and health-care advocacy groups to source equipment, often directly competing with the federal government for goods. Anticipating a protracted fight against COVID-19 that could involve multiple waves of outbreak, reinforcing that availability and equitable distribution of essential medical supplies should be the priority of existing federal agencies.In hard-hit states such as New York, although hundreds of COVID-19 deaths are still occurring daily, hospital admissions appear to have plateaued. Credit might be due to effective physical distancing measures that limit community mobility. But progress in preventing the spread of COVID-19 has come with economic havoc—at least 17 million Americans are unemployed, a number that could ultimately surpass the Great Depression, and take years to correct. A new impasse is forming around the Trump administration's eagerness to boost the economy by lifting restrictions, just as mitigation efforts by the states are yielding results. The degree to which the USA stalled in taking aggressive action to curtail the spread of COVID-19 is directly the product of an administration marked by consistently poor timing, intent on making decisions in favour of economic interests instead of those that are guided by science and to protect health. The rush to reopen the country puts dollars over deaths.
Sustaining containment of COVID-19 in China/-/On April 8, China lifted its 76-day lockdown of Wuhan, with trains and flights resumed and highways reopened. Shanghai will reopen its schools for many students from April 27. Given that most new COVID-19 cases in China are imported, the country is reopening businesses and schools gradually and cautiously.The quick containment of COVID-19 in China is impressive and sets an encouraging example for other countries. What can be learnt from China? Aggressive public health interventions, such as early detection of cases, contact tracing, and population behavioural change, have contributed enormously to containing the epidemic. Kiesha Prem and colleagues found that a staggered relaxation of physical distancing measures in Wuhan in early April—such as school and workplace closures—is the most effective way to reduce the number of infections. To relieve the huge pressure on the health-care system, Fangcang shelter hospitals have also been crucial. Chen Wang and colleagues describe how these large temporary hospitals were built to isolate, treat, and triage patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Such hospitals, built within 3 weeks, have provided care to around 12 000 patients in Wuhan as of March 10, 2020.However, China's success has come with huge social and economic costs, and China must make difficult decisions to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection. Can China maintain containment? Kathy Leung and colleagues argue that the over-riding public health priority for China is to closely monitor the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) and confirmed case-fatality risk. Restrictions should be relaxed gradually so that the Rt does not exceed 1. Otherwise, cases would increase exponentially again, unleashing a second wave of infection.Implementing a science-based lockdown exit strategy is essential to sustain containment of COVID-19. China's experience will be watched closely, as other countries start considering—and, in some cases, implementing—their own exit strategies.
Unity amidst uncertainty: COVID-19 pandemic fosters collaboration in rheumatology community/-/The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing worldwide uncertainty and anxiety. This unease is especially acute for those with the vague “underlying conditions” that render them more vulnerable to the infection or severe complications. People with rheumatic disease are likely to fall into this category because they are often immunocompromised as a result of their diseases and the medications used to treat them. Adding to this concern is the lack of explicit data for this population.Rheumatological societies have been quick to offer reassurance in the form of broad guidelines on COVID-19. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), among others, have advised that patients remain on prescribed medication unless their physician says otherwise—a response to the temptation of patients to reduce or stop medications that compromise their immune system. Those who test positive for COVID-19, however, should temporarily discontinue certain treatments, according to draft recommendations released by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Face-to-face contact with a doctor is also discouraged in favour of remote contact whenever possible, as recommended by the British Society for Rheumatologists (BSR). The BSR also points out that, in the absence of data about specific vulnerabilities among patients with rheumatic disease, everyone should practice social distancing.The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance hopes to address the gap in data on patients with rheumatic diseases. Their new registry aims to collect information from medical practitioners worldwide on how COVID-19 interacts with rheumatic diseases and their associated comorbidities and medications, in an effort to best help patients through this challenging time. The Alliance encourages the reporting of all confirmed cases; they report the preliminary characteristics of the first 110 individuals in the registry in the Lancet Rheumatology.The evidence from this collaborative effort should allow rheumatologists to offer better-informed responses to their patients' questions. Many of those questions revolve around patients seeing their prescribed drugs hyped in the news media as possible treatments for COVID-19. Indeed, in patients with severe COVID-19 and evidence of hyperinflammation, there is some evidence that immunosuppression might be helpful. As such, several drugs used to treat rheumatic disease are being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials: the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor blocker anakinra, and the IL-6 pathway inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab to treat cytokine release syndrome; and the Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib to reduce inflammation and possibly also viral invasion of host cells. This has led to speculation that patients with rheumatic diseases who already take these cytokine inhibitors might actually be protected against the most severe manifestations of disease.But perhaps the greatest media hype has been around hydroxychloroquine—a drug commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Preclinical data has shown that hydroxychloroquine exhibits anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Several non-randomised trials have been reported for hydroxychloroquine, but none of these reach the usual standards expected for drug approval. Despite this, the US Food and drug administration (FDA) has granted its emergency approval for treatment of COVID-19, as has also been done in other countries. Whether these drugs will finally prove efficacious for COVID-19 is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that the decision has serious implications for those with rheumatic diseases who rely on these drugs to control their symptoms.Even before the FDA approval, shortages of hydroxychloroquine were being reported. The ACR has warned that withdrawal of this drug from patients with SLE for as little as two weeks is likely to result in flares. They recommend that a stock of hydroxychloroquine be earmarked for those with rheumatic diseases and outline safeguards to protect those most in need.ACR, EULAR, and other rheumatological societies deserve recognition for their leadership and for advocating for the needs of patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether patients with rheumatic disease have worse (or better) outcomes with this disease is unknown for now, but the pandemic has highlighted the close collaboration of the rheumatology community who we trust will provide answers to this question soon.
Palliative care and the COVID-19 pandemic/-/Palliative care services are under-resourced at the best of times. The 2017 Lancet Commission on Palliative Care and Pain Relief described the widespread lack of access to inexpensive and effective interventions as a travesty of justice. And these are not the best of times. As health systems become strained under COVID-19, providing safe and effective palliative care, including end-of-life care, becomes especially vital and especially difficult.Some doctors, short of resources, might have to decide who can receive critical care and who cannot. For patients who won't survive, high-quality palliative care needs to be provided at least. But COVID-19 makes this more difficult. Time is short when patients deteriorate quickly, health professionals are overworked, isolation is mandated, and families are advised not to touch or even be in the same room as loved ones. This scenario will be compounded most in low-income and middle-income countries where shortages of both critical care and palliative care services are greatest. Continuing community-based palliative care is also harder to do safely. Many patients who need it are at heightened risk from COVID-19, protective equipment is running short, and surging deaths could overwhelm usual service provision.WHO has issued guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic, highlighting immunisation, maternal care, emergency care, and chronic diseases among others, but there was no mention of palliative care. This was an oversight. Indeed, palliative care ought to be an explicit part of national and international response plans for COVID-19. Practical steps can be taken: ensure access to drugs (such as opioids) and protective equipment, consider a greater use of telemedicine and video, discuss advance care plans, provide better training and preparation across the health workforce, and embrace the role of lay carers and the wider community.A pandemic is a cause and powerful amplifier of suffering, through physical illness and death, through stresses and anxieties, and through financial and social instability. Alleviation of that suffering, in all its forms, needs to be a key part of the response.
The gendered dimensions of COVID-19/-/SARS-CoV-2 does not discriminate, but without careful consideration, the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic might. Demographic data from small studies are already informing political decisions and clinical research strategies. Women and men are affected by COVID-19, but biology and gender norms are shaping the disease burden. The success of the global response—the ability of both women and men to survive and recover from the pandemic's effects—will depend on the quality of evidence informing the response and the extent to which data represent sex and gender differences.Global Health 50/50 tracks sex-disaggregated infection and mortality COVID-19 data from the 39 most-affected countries. Some countries, including the UK, the USA, Russia, and Brazil, have yet to report such data. From those that have, it is unclear whether women or men are more likely to become infected, but more men are dying from COVID-19. Adverse outcomes of COVID-19 seem to be associated with comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and lung disease. These conditions are more prevalent in men and are linked to smoking and drinking alcohol—behaviours associated with masculine norms.Women carry a different kind of burden from COVID-19. Inequities disproportionately affect their wellbeing and economic resilience during lockdowns. Households are under strain, but child care, elderly care, and housework typically fall on women. Concerns over increased domestic violence are growing. With health services overstretched and charities under-resourced, women's sexual and reproductive health services, as well as prenatal and postnatal care, are disrupted.The European Association of Science Editors and other organisations urge all involved in collecting COVID-19 data to follow guidelines (eg, CONSORT, STROBE) and include age and sex in demographic data. We echo this call and encourage a gender focus in all research efforts. Obscuring sex and gender differences in treatment and vaccine development could result in harm. Incomplete reporting compromises meta-analyses. Addressing the health needs of men and women equally will help societies recover and resist future human tragedies.
Pandemic school closures: risks and opportunities/-/The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept across 210 countries and territories with over 1·2 million cases and 67 594 deaths reported by April 6, 2020. Most countries have implemented social distancing measures to curb the spread of infection and minimise the impact of the virus.188 countries have implemented country-wide school closures, but a modelling study by Ferguson and colleagues concluded that in the UK, school closures alone will reduce COVID-19 deaths by only 2–4%. Most evidence for school closures has come from influenza outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in which children were disproportionately affected. During that time, the US closed 700 schools but the response was local and only for a couple of weeks. To tackle COVID-19, Chinese schools have been closed for more than 2 months, and many countries have closed their schools and colleges indefinitely.Despite increasing reports of some children with underlying conditions experiencing serious illness and even death, the vast majority of children and adolescents experience mild symptoms in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. With over 90% of the world's students (more than 1·5 billion young people) currently out of education, it's clear that the greatest threats from COVID-19 to children and adolescents lie outside the clinic.A systematic review by Russell Viner and colleagues, published on April 6, assessed findings from 16 studies looking at the effects of school closures on coronavirus outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. They found limited benefit on slowing the spread of the virus, and the authors stress that closures must be considered within the wider context of loss of essential workers due to childcare demands, restrictions in learning, socialising, and physical activity for pupils, and the substantial risks to the most vulnerable children, including those in low-income settings. Following school closures amidst the west African Ebola epidemic, rates of child labour, neglect, sexual abuse, and adolescent pregnancies spiked, and many children never returned to school.Many children will suffer from a lack of access to school-provided social assistance, such as free lunches or clean water and washing facilities. Those engaged with school-facilitated health care, such as vaccinations and mental health services, may miss out on vital health provisions. Children confined at home will struggle to achieve the WHO 24 h movement behaviour guidelines which recommend 60 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for 5–17 year olds. This jeopardises not only young people's mental wellbeing and healthy weight status, but also increases the risk of establishing dangerous habits, such as increased screen time and snacking that can damage future cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health.For adolescents, school closures and social distancing may be particularly challenging. During adolescence young people grow in independence and begin to prioritise connections with peers over parents—disruption of these can pose significant challenges to young people's wellbeing. Adolescents may also be grieving for the rites of passage they were due to experience and feeling apprehensive about an uncertain future in the face of cancelled exams. Anxiety might also arise in older children and adolescents as they try to understand the pandemic and the threat it poses to them, their families, and friends.Public health officials must prioritise national plans for how and when to reopen schools, with consideration of alternative measures such as reduced hours or staggered lessons. Many children will likely require support as they transition back to normal life, especially those who have experienced bereavement.In the meantime, the pandemic offers an opportunity for young people to develop and hone their resilience and adaptability, and appreciate the value of social responsibility and self-sacrifice for the protection of the most vulnerable. Many inspirational young people are rising up to drive the COVID-19 response in their communities. Xian Lu, who moved to Wuhan to cook 400 meals a day for medical personnel during the city's peak crisis, is one of ten young people recently recognised by Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary General's Envoy on Youth for their efforts in fighting the pandemic.It is imperative that we validate the experiences of the young during this global crisis, that we listen to their creative solutions for coping and connecting, and that we empower them to utilise their new skills to create a more robust, caring, and connected society as we emerge into the changed world.
Redefining vulnerability in the era of COVID-19/-/What does it mean to be vulnerable? Vulnerable groups of people are those that are disproportionally exposed to risk, but who is included in these groups can change dynamically. A person not considered vulnerable at the outset of a pandemic can become vulnerable depending on the policy response. The risks of sudden loss of income or access to social support have consequences that are difficult to estimate and constitute a challenge in identifying all those who might become vulnerable. Certainly, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable groups are not only elderly people, those with ill health and comorbidities, or homeless or underhoused people, but also people from a gradient of socioeconomic groups that might struggle to cope financially, mentally, or physically with the crisis.The strategies most recommended to control the spread of COVID-19—social distancing and frequent handwashing—are not easy for the millions of people who live in highly dense communities with precarious or insecure housing, and poor sanitation and access to clean water. Often people living in these settings also have malnutrition, non-communicable diseases, and infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. In South Africa, 15 million people live in townships where the incidence of HIV is around 25%. These immunocompromised populations are at greater risk to Covid-19. Another concern in African countries is that the response to COVID-19 will come at the expense of treating other diseases. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the response to Ebola resulted in the resurgence of measles.The effect of the policy response on children in the fight against COVID-19 is also a concern. On March 23, UNICEF reported that in Latin America and the Caribbean over 154 million children are temporarily out of school because of COVID-19. The impact of this policy is more far-reaching than just the loss of education—in this region, school food programmes benefit 85 million children, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization assessed that these programmes constitute one of the most reliable daily sources of food for around 10 million children. Questioning whether appropriate evidence exists to support the reduction of transmission through school closures, Richard Armitage and Laura Nellums considered the long-term risks of deepening social, economic, and health inequities for children in a letter published in The Lancet Global Health. A 2015 UN report analysing the socioeconomic effects of Ebola in Africa also highlighted the increased risks of pregnancy in young girls, school dropout, and child abuse.The most vulnerable children are part of families in which parents have informal jobs and are not able to work from home. This predicament is particularly concerning in countries like India, where over 80% of its workforce is employed in the informal sector and a third of people work as casual labourers. In socioeconomically fragile settings, a lockdown policy can exacerbate health inequalities and the consequences need careful consideration to avoid reinforcing the vicious cycle between poverty and ill health. Human Rights Watch has reported that the lockdown in India has disproportionately affected marginalised communities because of the loss of livelihood and lack of food, shelter, health, and other basic necessities. Under this unprecedented challenge, governments must be mindful that strategies to address the pandemic should not further marginalise or stigmatise affected communities.Vulnerable groups and health inequalities are also evident in developed countries. The USA is a stark reminder of the divide that exists in countries without a universal health-care system. For people who do not have private medical insurance, this pandemic might see them face the choice of devastating financial hardship or poor health outcomes, or both. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in the USA, individuals with poorer health outcomes were those in the lowest socioeconomic groups. This same group of vulnerable people have now been caught in the middle of a major health emergency as a result of long-standing differences in affluence.While responding to COVID-19, policy makers should consider the risk of deepening health inequalities. If vulnerable groups are not properly identified, the consequences of this pandemic will be even more devastating. Although WHO guidance should be followed, a one-size-fits-all model will not be appropriate. Each country must continually assess which members of society are vulnerable to fairly support those at the highest risk.
COVID-19 will not leave behind refugees and migrants/-/Never has the “leave no one behind” pledge felt more urgent. As nations around the world implement measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including lockdowns and restrictions on individuals’ movements, they must heed their global commitments. When member states adopted the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, they promised to ensure no one will be left behind. Chief among the world's most vulnerable people are refugees and migrants. The COVID-19 crisis puts these groups at enormous risk. Yet global pandemic efforts have so far failed in their duty of care to refugees and migrants.There are millions of refugees and migrants in camps and detention centres worldwide. Resettlement procedures have been suspended by the UN. UNHCR reports that 34 countries hosting substantial refugee populations have seen local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The often appalling conditions of migrant camps are fertile for infectious disease outbreaks. With few latrines and water supplies, basic hygiene to prevent spread is difficult. With extreme overcrowding, physical distancing is impossible.In Europe, tens of thousands of migrants live in densely packed camps along the Mediterranean, without adequate medical personnel and infrastructure to cope. With no emergency COVID-19 plan in place by governments, Médicins san Frontières has demanded evacuation of 42 000 asylum seekers on the Greek islands to suitable accommodation. In a Lancet Comment, WHO leaders appeal for more attention for refugees and migrants, including in humanitarian settings, which are facing disruption of essential supplies of food, medicines, and aid workers.The worst might be yet to come. 80% of refugees live in low-income and middle-income countries, the sites of the expected fourth wave of COVID-19 behind China, Europe, and the USA. Already, these settings have weak health-care systems, scarce protective equipment, and poor testing and treatment capacity. They need enormous global support to prepare for an impending crisis. This virus disregards all borders. COVID-19 responses must not overlook refugees and migrants.
Will science save us?/-/As this Editorial goes to press, normal life for millions of people around the globe has ground to a surreal halt. We shelter in place–shuttering our businesses, cancelling social gatherings big and small, and minimising all but the most essential of human interactions to slow the spread of a novel and deadly human respiratory virus, SARS-CoV2. This virus is the causative agent of COVID-19 and was first identified a few short months ago in December 2019. Although psychologically challenging and economically devastating, physical distancing is thought to be our best hope to minimise casualties, help protect our frontline caregivers by reducing the surge in numbers of hospital cases, and buy some time to formulate a counterattack.And counterattack we most surely will. Laboratories and clinicians around the world have banded together, working against the clock to assess and subdue our common tiny enemy. Together, we seek therapies to treat the sick and vaccines to protect the susceptible. We seek a scientific solution.Until a vaccine is available, one of our best shots at fighting COVID-19 in the clinic might be to repurpose drugs that have been tested in humans for other diseases. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are two such repurposed drugs being tested in multiple clinical trials around the world. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue that was originally studied as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg viruses, but has been shown to be effective at inhibiting viral replication of several coronaviruses including the novel SARS-CoV2 in the laboratory. Trials of remdesivir in China and the USA are due to report initial findings in the coming weeks, and two phase 3 trials have been announced in the UK on April 2. The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has also received increased attention after a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) from China was posted on March 31, before peer-review, on the preprint server, medRxiv. This unpublished study was limited to a small cohort of mildly or moderately ill patients but suggested that hydroxychloroquine could shorten time to clinical recovery and might help to clear pneumonia. However, another study published on March 30 in the journal Medecine et Maladies Infectieuses showed that patients with severe infection did not see a similar therapeutic benefit when given hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. Larger RCTs are needed to determine not only whether hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, but also whether the severity of disease and other factors might play a role in treatment outcome.A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 disease might succumb to a hyper-inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, in which an overactive immune system can wreak havoc on the lungs and other parts of the body leading, in worst cases, to multi-organ failure and death. Clinical trials are also underway to test whether drugs that target the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6, such as toxilizumab or sarilumab, could be an effective treatment in this subset of patients. However, given its intended purpose of resolving infection, blocking the inflammatory response might not be without risks. The timing of treatment could be an important consideration for any approach aimed at manipulating inflammation.On March 24, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York (New York, USA) announced that they would begin testing plasmapheresis of convalescent serum on patients who have COVID-19 who are critically ill. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved this treatment for compassionate use in patients with severe cases of disease and other hospitals in the USA and globally are launching similar treatment protocols. The method has been used for more than 100 years and is based on a simple concept: isolate virus-specific antibodies from the blood of recovered COVID-19 patients, and infuse these into infected patients to neutralise virus, providing protective immunity. There are some indications from a small case series from China published in JAMA Network on March 27 that broader studies might be warranted. In this preliminary study, five severely ill patients were treated with donor plasma containing IgG and IgM anti SARS-CoV-19 antibodies, and all five patients showed signs of improvement after 1 week of transfusion. This case series has some important limitations that should be noted, including absence of untreated controls and the fact that concurrent treatments might have played a role in the outcome.Never before have scientists and clinicians united with such scale and singular focus. Based on a small number of preliminary studies, a large coordinated effort is now underway to properly vet our best available therapeutic weapons against COVID-19. We wait for the research to tell us if these therapies are safe and effective enough to help us through this phase of the battle. All the while, behind the scenes, we work on a long-term strategy against the virus.
Knowledge is (still) power/-/More so than ever, the need for accurate reliable medical information has been highlighted. At a time when a single disease is affecting people of many nations, social, and educational background, the hunger for information of any kind is at its greatest. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provides us with the opportunity to assess the public's relationship with information on their health and healthcare modalities and asks whether we can learn valuable lessons that can be carried forward post pandemic.COVID-19 comes at a time when we are more connected than ever. The advent of cheap flights means we are able to travel more frequently, and this physical mobility is mirrored in our global use of telecommunications, allowing us to disseminate information over long distances across vast numbers of people. Indeed, the rapid dissemination of information over online networks is often referred to as going viral.All too often in the sphere of health care and healthy living, the information that goes viral is, at best, based on poorly interpreted analysis and, at worst, seeks to play to the worst fears of the audience. Outside of the current pandemic, science has struggled with the dissemination of a number of topics and sources of misinformation. Over the past decade, vaccination numbers have declined in regions across the globe. This decline has led to incidents of recurring measles in the UK, tetanus in the USA, and diphtheria in Europe. Dissemination of ideas that have an inherent attractiveness, but are not based on reliable evidence are particularly prevalent among anti-vaccination proponents. One example is the idea that vaccination causes, as a side-effect, other disorders, such as autism. In the face of vast amounts of data demonstrating otherwise, falsehoods over vaccine safety, autism fears, and the role of vaccination in the eradication of diseases are still spread. We see a similar information overload when individuals seek information on how to live healthy lives. From exercise, to nutrition, to the most appropriate treatment modalities for ailments, our best source of information (the internet) is awash with non-evidence-based content. The insufficiency of access to appropriate health care can be a strong motivator to seek guidance from non-medical professionals.The current pandemic has shown that, in many cases, the people we would typically look to for leadership and guidance show poor judgement on the information that they utilise and share. The public looks to elected leaders to provide the most reliable and fact-based information, expecting public policy to be led by this process. Several examples show that this is not the case. During the Easter period, the president of Tanzania, John Magufuli, was quoted as saying, “This is time to build our faith and continue praying to God and not depending on facemasks. Don't stop going to churches and mosques for prayers. I'm sure this is just a change of wind and it will go like others have gone”. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently downplayed the dangers of the COVID-19, endangering the populace by saying, “Brazilians have to be studied, they don't get anything. You see the guy jumping into the sewer there, going out, diving, right? And nothing happens to him”. Comments describing the pandemic as “a little flu”, combined with public visits to busy markets completely mislead the public at a time when sound, life-saving information was required. The US president, Donald Trump, has repeatedly disseminated apocryphal information publicly and via social media to downplay the seriousness of the virus. During a visit to India he stated, “Now they have it, they have studied it, they know very much, in fact, we're very close to a vaccine”. This statement, based presumably on hope rather than facts, caused confusion for citizens. At a rally in early February, he stated, “And by the way, the virus. They're working hard. Looks like by April, you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away”. This is in stark contrast to the statement made by the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a few days later, “We don't know a lot about this virus. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission”. Deeming the need for a lockdown no longer necessary, the US president's latest communications have sought to encourage citizens to congregate. Encouraging reopening of individual states, President Trump has praised the protestors calling them, “great people”, and has said, “Their life was taken away from them”. “These people love our country, they want to get back to work.” The UK government, fronted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, brought the term herd immunity to the forefront of public consciousness. During a press conference on March 12, the group downplayed the importance of a prompt national lockdown testing and community surveillance, in favour of hoping that herd immunity would passively deal with the pandemic. This led to a false sense of security in the populace, and was counter to more up-to-date modelling data. The end result being a change of policy 3 days later. Political leaders should be installed by the public based on their ability to lead. Although we might not expect them to become true experts in an emergent crisis, the minimum expectation is deference to the deep evidence-based knowledge of those who do. Failure to do so is another avenue to confusion and misdirection of the public at large.Misdirection at the top encourages similar bad habits among the populace. Social media and social networks allow anyone the platform to voice their theories–however baseless–to a wide community. 5G theories have captured the imaginations of fake news proponents, spreading the idea that this new technology is the true cause of the viral symptoms and mortality we see around us. The ease with which individuals spread videos playing on fear of tech, mixed with pseudoscience correlations, is a major concern. Indeed, the global dissemination of unproven causes and cure-alls for COVID-19 are rampant. From cow urine prophylactics, repurposed bomb detectors (claimed to detect COVID-19 in 5 min), lemongrass and elderberry tea treatments, and the felling of allergic poplar trees, cures and causes are rapidly spread. This rampant abuse of social media platforms has prompted giants to make relatively strident interventions to their systems. Searching google for “COVID-19” or “coronavirus” initially presents a page with government and prominent news agencies, preventing the appearance of more disreputable information sources. YouTube, a Google subsidiary brand, has sought to suppress the promotion of COVID-19-related conspiracy videos, importantly decreasing advertising revenue. Facebook is using its tracking algorithms to direct individuals who like, share, and comment on conspiracy pages to the WHO MythBusters page. WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) has sought to slow the overall speed of dissemination by reducing the number of people to whom a single message that has already been widely shared can be sent. As a messaging service that boasts end-to-end encryption the company is unable to specifically assess and limit the content of individual shared messages. Purely preventing individuals from receiving information in a health crisis is one aspect of the battle, but ensuring appropriate evidence-based knowledge is spread is the key to winning the war.In the fears and uncertainty that follow a major health-care crisis, individuals seek information and reassurance in the places most familiar to them. Incidences such as the current pandemic present a rare opportunity for health-care communications to speak to and educate a large audience at its most captive. Alongside providing reassurance, quality health-care communication can empower the public with knowledge on how they can contribute to the safety of their immediate community. We will eventually see the end of this pandemic, but a hopeful enduring result might be a more engaged infectious disease-aware society.EClinicalMedicine

COVID-19: global consequences for oncology/-/As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic escalates and countries struggle to contain the virus, health-care systems are under increasing pressure. Emergency departments and intensive care units are nearing breaking point, and medical resources are being diverted to tackle the crisis. Moreover, conferences are being cancelled, and research trials are grinding to a halt. So what does COVID-19 mean for patients with cancer, their physicians, and the wider oncology discipline?Patients with cancer are a high-risk group in the COVID-19 pandemic. They are already vulnerable to infection because of their underlying illness and often immunosuppressed status, and are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the virus, including intensive care unit admission or even death. Moreover, for those who develop COVID-19, treatment of the disease will be prioritised, and further cancer therapy could be delayed, although such decisions must be made on a patient-by-patient basis and not based only on the early small reports published in the first few weeks of the pandemic. Media reports have described patients with cancer in quarantined cities being unable to travel to appointments or struggling to obtain essential medicines; the risk of interruptions in drug supply chains and consequent shortages will exacerbate this issue. Scheduled operations, some types of cancer treatment, and appointments are being cancelled or postponed to prioritise hospital beds and care for those who are seriously ill with COVID-19. In England, UK, despite the 2020 budget promising several billion pounds of extra NHS funding to help tackle the outbreak, when cases of COVID-19 peak in the coming weeks the NHS will undoubtedly be forced to delay non-urgent treatments and surgeries as resources and personnel are repurposed.Unfortunately, the effects of COVID-19 are not solely limited to the treatment of patients with cancer, but will also hit the wider oncology community, with inevitable consequences for research, education, and collaboration. University campuses in the worst hit countries have shut down, with many others expected to follow. Some of those affected, including the University of Bologna, Italy, have responded by digitising their teaching programmes, moving classes and exams online to alleviate the educational impact. However, such solutions cannot be used for practical laboratory work or field studies, and ongoing research projects are being jeopardised. Limited resources and capacity will force institutions to decide which clinical trials to prioritise and which to suspend. Many institutions, including the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA, USA) are restricting employees’ work-related travel, and others such as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA, USA—one of the worst-affected US cities) are implementing mandatory work from home policies. However, not all centres in affected regions have similar policies, and such heterogeneity might create imbalances in patient cohorts in multicentre trials, potentially biasing eventual results.With some governments advising against or banning non-essential travel and large-scale events, at least eight major cancer meetings and conferences have been cancelled or postponed, with many more expected to follow. As a result, innumerable opportunities for discussion and collaboration will be lost, the latest research will not be presented, and patients will subsequently be affected by the delay in dissemination of information on the latest treatment to their doctors. Although some congresses are being reorganised to take place online, face-to-face meetings are a crucial aspect of team science and cannot be eliminated completely. Furthermore, societies and organisations postponing or cancelling meetings will probably face financial consequences that could have long-term effects on their ability to fund key activities in the future. The American Society of Clinical Oncology—which at the time of writing had not yet decided about their 2020 annual meeting—relied on a huge US$43 million in revenue from education and meeting registration fees in 2018. For smaller societies that rely on their annual meetings financially, cancellations could threaten their existence.With the situation constantly changing, all we can do for now is watch, wait, and adapt as best we can until the immediate and long-term effects of this pandemic fully materialise. Ultimately, the situation might lead to substantial changes in how research and medicine are practiced in the future, such as reduced international travel and increased remote networking and telemedicine. Until the COVID-19 pandemic is over, we can only hope that the consequences are not too devastating for patients and that the oncology community and beyond are able to weather this unprecedented storm.
COVID-19: learning from experience/-/Over the past 2 weeks, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has marched relentlessly westward. On March 13, WHO said that Europe was now the centre of the pandemic. A few days later, deaths in Italy surpassed those in China. Iran and Spain had also reported over 1000 deaths as of March 23, and many other European countries and the USA reported increasing numbers of cases, heralding an imminent wave of fatalities. Following the sweep of COVID-19 is a series of dramatic containment measures that reflect the scale of the threat posed by the pandemic. Lockdowns that seemed draconian when instigated in Wuhan only 2 months ago are now becoming commonplace. However, many countries are still not following WHO's clear recommendations on containment (widespread testing, quarantine of cases, contact tracing, and social distancing) and have instead implemented haphazard measures, with some attempting only to suppress deaths by shielding the elderly and those with certain health conditions.The initial slow response in countries such as the UK, the USA, and Sweden now looks increasingly poorly judged. As leaders scramble to acquire diagnostic tests, personal protective equipment, and ventilators for overwhelmed hospitals, there is a growing sense of anger. The patchwork of harmful initial reactions from many leaders, from denial and misplaced optimism, to passive acceptance of large-scale deaths, was justified by words such as unprecedented. But this belies the damage wrought by SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus, Zika virus, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and a widespread acceptance among scientists that a pandemic would one day occur. Hong Kong and South Korea were tested by these previous emerging infections, leaving them better able to scale up testing and contact tracing.Globally, many people are afraid, angry, uncertain, and without confidence in their national leadership. But alongside these dark sentiments, images of solidarity have emerged. Health workers have shown an incredible commitment to their communities and responded with compassion and resolve to tackle the virus despite challenging and sometimes dangerous conditions. Neighbours have organised to support vulnerable people; businesses and national governments have stepped up to provide support for those who need it and strengthen social security and health services. The pandemic has also brought examples of international solidarity, with the sharing of resources, information, and expertise from countries further ahead in the epidemic, or with better results in controlling the spread. China's experience will be crucial to understanding how to lift restrictions safely.Inevitably, the next wave of infections will hit Africa and Latin America. The Africa CDC has reported cases in 41 countries; Brazil, Mexico, and Peru have all reported hundreds or thousands of cases. Most African or Latin American countries have only tens or hundreds of ventilators, and many health facilities do not have even basic therapies such as oxygen. Fragile health-care systems would soon be overwhelmed should infection spread widely. People living in poor, overcrowded, urban areas are especially vulnerable; many do not have basic sanitation, could not self-isolate, and have no paid sick leave or social security. In response to the threat, WHO has launched the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which has raised more than US$70 million, and some regional organisations have taken strong proactive action, sharing information and receiving donations of testing kits and medical supplies. Many national governments have responded swiftly, but many are yet to take the threat of COVID-19 seriously—eg, ignoring WHO's recommendation on avoiding mass gatherings. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been strongly criticised by health experts and faces an intensifying public backlash for what is seen as his weak response.Alongside the deep distress felt as many countries experience a peak in cases or brace for it, there is also a growing understanding about the importance of the collective and community. Europe and the USA have shown that putting off preparation, in either the hope of containment elsewhere or a mood of fatality, is not effective. It is imperative that the global community takes advantage of this spirit of cooperation to avoid repeating this error in more vulnerable countries. WHO has provided consistent, clear, and evidence-based recommendations; communicated effectively; and navigated difficult political situations shrewdly. The world is not lacking effective global leadership. The central role played by WHO in coordinating the global response must continue, and countries and donors need to support WHO in these efforts.
COVID-19: protecting health-care workers/-/Worldwide, as millions of people stay at home to minimise transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, health-care workers prepare to do the exact opposite. They will go to clinics and hospitals, putting themselves at high risk from COVID-2019. Figures from China's National Health Commission show that more than 3300 health-care workers have been infected as of early March and, according to local media, by the end of February at least 22 had died. In Italy, 20% of responding health-care workers were infected, and some have died. Reports from medical staff describe physical and mental exhaustion, the torment of difficult triage decisions, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues, all in addition to the infection risk.As the pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers is a key concern. Medical staff are prioritised in many countries, but PPE shortages have been described in the most affected facilities. Some medical staff are waiting for equipment while already seeing patients who may be infected or are supplied with equipment that might not meet requirements. Alongside concerns for their personal safety, health-care workers are anxious about passing the infection to their families. Health-care workers who care for elderly parents or young children will be drastically affected by school closures, social distancing policies, and disruption in the availability of food and other essentials.Health-care systems globally could be operating at more than maximum capacity for many months. But health-care workers, unlike ventilators or wards, cannot be urgently manufactured or run at 100% occupancy for long periods. It is vital that governments see workers not simply as pawns to be deployed, but as human individuals. In the global response, the safety of health-care workers must be ensured. Adequate provision of PPE is just the first step; other practical measures must be considered, including cancelling non-essential events to prioritise resources; provision of food, rest, and family support; and psychological support. Presently, health-care workers are every country's most valuable resource.
COVID-19: delay, mitigate, and communicate/-/On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and has called for governments to take “urgent and aggressive action” to change the course of the outbreak. As of March 12, 2020, the USA has suspended all travel from 26 European countries, and Italy is the latest country to enforce widespread lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus. Robust plans and policies to avoid the disease trajectories seen in the worst-hit countries are urgently needed. These responses must be proportionate to each country's situation and communicated in a clear and balanced way to avoid spreading fear and panic.The UK preparedness plan for tackling COVID-19, informed by WHO guidance and launched on March 3, 2020, includes four phases: containment, delay, mitigation, and, alongside these, research to better understand the disease and its effects, and to address the challenges of imperfect diagnostic approaches and absence of proven treatments or a vaccine. Containment measures, aimed at preventing the disease from taking hold, are broadly in line with those of other European countries at a similar stage in the outbreak, encompassing early detection, isolation, and care of people already infected, with careful tracing and screening of their contacts. These measures might have staved off a sharp rise in cases, as seen in Italy, for now but case numbers are inevitably climbing. Although the controversial containment measures used in China have bought some time for other regions of the world, such strategies are unlikely to be replicated in Europe. The example of Singapore could be informative for many countries: having learned lessons from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002–03, Singapore has so far managed the outbreak well, with rapid testing of suspected cases, clear public health messages from the outset, and by individuals taking action to protect themselves and others.With cases approaching 500, the UK has now moved to the delay phase, a decision that has been criticised for coming too late. The delay phase aims to slow the spread and push the peak impact away from the winter season to reduce pressure on an already overstretched NHS. Social distancing strategies, some of which are already in place in other European countries, such as the cancellation of conferences and other large gatherings, reducing non-essential use of public transport, and closure of schools, are under consideration but yet to be implemented in the UK. Rather, simple but important containment measures such as handwashing are being promoted, as is self-isolation for 7 days for those with symptoms, which is thought to be more effective than school closures and bans on mass gatherings. Although the list of countries imposing tight restrictions on people who have travelled from regions with high caseloads is growing, the UK is unlikely to follow suit, and WHO does not recommend large-scale international travel restrictions or closure of borders owing to the major implications for trade, international collaboration, and supply chains for food and resources, including medical equipment. Decisions about delay strategies must be scientifically based and clearly justified to the public—via all communication platforms, including social media—to counter misinformation and avoid fuelling panic.Mitigation planning for widely established infection—as seen in China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea—is essential to enable optimum care for patients, maintenance of essential hospital services, and provision of ongoing support for infected people in the community to minimise disruption to society, public services, and the economy in the event of a prolonged pandemic. The higher rates of severe or fatal cases in Italy compared with other countries with major outbreaks (eg, South Korea) might reflect the older population in affected regions of Italy and highlight the need to tailor mitigation plans to local demographics. Many health systems will be stretched beyond capacity by the demands of increasing COVID-19 caseloads. In the UK, for example, intensive care unit (ICU) bed numbers per person are already worryingly low compared with those of other European countries, so thorough surge capacity planning is needed. Interim strategies with makeshift intensive care facilities outside ICU settings could be provided to care for less severely affected patients, but such an approach would not be sustainable in the long term. Support for health-care professionals on the frontline should also be prioritised.All governments must now take decisive action to more aggressively combat the outbreak. COVID-19 represents a substantial risk to large sections of the population, and especially elderly people and those with pre-existing health conditions. As the outbreak progresses, balanced, coherent, and consistent public health communication, based on science, will be essential.
COVID-19, a pandemic or not?/-/The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread, and as of March 11, 2020, it has reached 115 countries, with 119 239 cases and 4287 deaths. In January, WHO decided to define the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern, which triggered the release of funding and other resources. Despite SARS-CoV-2 now being present in every continent apart from Antartica, WHO remains reluctant to make the next step and call the outbreak a pandemic. On March 5, Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, stated that while the outbreak might be uncontrolled in some settings, it is not yet uncontrollable and that would be the threshold to pass for the definition of a pandemic. However, on March 8, Tedros admitted that the threat of a pandemic is becoming very real, and should WHO decide to call the outbreak a pandemic, it would be “the first pandemic that could be actually controlled”.What are reasons behind WHO's reluctance to define the outbreak of COVID-19 an pandemic and what difference would it make? There are mixed views about the impact that a declaration of a pandemic by WHO would have. On the one hand, a declaration of a pandemic would favour a change of strategy in managing COVID-19 with more focus on implementing social distancing measures and less empashis on border closure, which might help to flatten the epidemic curve. Moreover, several insurance companies have policies that will pay claims only if a formal declaration of pandemic is made by WHO. On the other hand, senior WHO official Michael Ryan and others cautioned against “the dangers of using the pandemic word”. The main concern is that calling the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic might prompt governments to needlessly or prematurely change their strategies in ways that could undermine their efforts at containment.These concerns stem from the fact that in outbreak management, two approaches for disease control can be considered: if a pathogen has slow transmission capacity, containment is the approach that permits adoption of measures that limit the spread of a pathogen within well-defined foci (eg, identification and isolation of infected patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of small areas where cases have appeared); by contrast, when a pathogen starts to spread rapidly and there is sustained local transmission, rendering it impossible to isolate all cases, mitigation measures should be put in place with aims such as slowing down the spread of a pathogen within a country or region. Mitigation measures, such as the closure of schools and banning of mass events, specifically aim at avoiding overburdening health systems with an escalation of cases in need of intensive care. The current lockdown of Italy in the face of the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases has this specific goal. The time gained through mitigation measures can potentially also allow the evaluation of new therapeutic options and in the long run the development of a vaccine. WHO's current position is that in most areas containment of COVID-19 is still possible, so a declaration of a pandemic would hamper the commitment of individual countries to put in place rapidly and effectively the required containment measures.Independently from the potential definition of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world is putting into question the utility of travel bans, strongly opposed by WHO, that some countries have adopted to reduce the risk of introducing the virus in their territories. Banning incoming flights from countries with high numbers of cases of COVID-19 is not a watertight measure because it does not prevent infected individuals from arriving from countries with intermediate numbers where controls are less stringent. In addition, screening travellers for fever using infrared thermometers at airport customs and border checkpoints misses at least 25% of people with fever, making the measure suboptimal for stopping entry of the virus in a country. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by asymptomatic infected people also puts in doubt the value of control measures such as screening at borders. For severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, despite extensive controls in airports, not a single case was detected before entering a country.The uncertainty around COVID-19 being a pandemic is causing a disjointed response to the disease among different countries. Declaration of a pandemic, combined with clear and coordinated management guidelines, might help every country limit the impact of the disease and bring it more swiftly under control.
COVID-19: too little, too late?/-/Although WHO has yet to call the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection a pandemic, it has confirmed that the virus is likely to spread to most, if not all, countries. Regardless of terminology, this latest coronavirus epidemic is now seeing larger increases in cases outside China. As of March 3, more than 90 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 73 countries. The outbreak in northern Italy, which has seen 11 towns officially locked down and residents threatened with imprisonment if they try to leave, shocked European political leaders. Their shock turned to horror as they saw Italy become the epicentre for further spread across the continent. As the window for global containment closes, health ministers are scrambling to implement appropriate measures to delay spread of the virus. But their actions have been slow and insufficient. There is now a real danger that countries have done too little, too late to contain the epidemic.By striking contrast, the WHO-China joint mission report calls China's vigorous public health measures toward this new coronavirus probably the most “ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history”. China seems to have avoided a substantial number of cases and fatalities, although there have been severe effects on the nation's economy. In its report on the joint mission, WHO recommends that countries activate the highest level of national response management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approaches needed to contain viral spread. China's success rests largely with a strong administrative system that it can mobilise in times of threat, combined with the ready agreement of the Chinese people to obey stringent public health procedures. Although other nations lack China's command-and-control political economy, there are important lessons that presidents and prime ministers can learn from China's experience. The signs are that those lessons have not been learned.SARS-CoV-2 presents different challenges to high-income and low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs). A major fear over global spread is how weak health systems will cope. Some countries, such as Nigeria, have so far successfully dealt with individual cases. But large outbreaks could easily overwhelm LMIC health services. The difficult truth is that countries in most of sub-Saharan Africa, for example, are not prepared for an epidemic of coronavirus. And nor are many nations across Latin America and the Middle East. Public health measures, such as surveillance, exhaustive contact tracing, social distancing, travel restrictions, educating the public on hand hygiene, ensuring flu vaccinations for the frail and immunocompromised, and postponing non-essential operations and services will all play their part in delaying the spread of infection and dispersing pressure on hospitals. Individual governments will need to decide where they draw the line on implementing these measures. They will have to weigh the ethical, social, and economic risks versus proven health benefits.The evidence surely indicates that political leaders should be moving faster and more aggressively. As Xiaobo Yang and colleagues have shown, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is substantial. As they wrote recently in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, “The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.” This coronavirus is not benign. It kills. The political response to the epidemic should therefore reflect the national security threat that SARS-CoV-2 represents.National governments have all released guidance for health-care professionals, but published advice alone is insufficient. Guidance on how to manage patients with COVID-19 must be delivered urgently to health-care workers in the form of workshops, online teaching, smart phone engagement, and peer-to-peer education. Equipment such as personal protective equipment, ventilators, oxygen, and testing kits must be made available and supply chains strengthened. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that hospitals set up a core team including hospital management, an infection control team member, an infectious disease expert, and specialists representing the intensive care unit and accident and emergency departments.So far, evidence suggests that the colossal public health efforts of the Chinese Government have saved thousands of lives. High-income countries, now facing their own outbreaks, must take reasoned risks and act more decisively. They must abandon their fears of the negative short-term public and economic consequences that may follow from restricting public freedoms as part of more assertive infection control measures.
During a world health crisis: A personal view/-/Like many of you, I am struggling to go about my daily work routine. I am unfocussed and distracted. I am supposed to write an editorial now and the deadline is approaching faster than originally planned. We need more time with production, now that the workload and the amount of time-sensitive studies have increased. Everyone's day-to-day workflow has changed, and we are doing our best to adjust, manage, and to keep things going.As an editor for a medical journal, it is my job to stay up-to-date with current knowledge. So, of course, I read; I watch WHO's press conferences and briefings; and I follow leaders in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology. I still consider myself a scientist, although I quit the bench few years ago. As a scientist, you ask questions, and do experiments and testing to collect data to find an answer. We aim to create knowledge and gain understanding. I learned to deal with problems with knowledge. If you know how things work, then you can fix them. This is my approach in life—for good or for bad. During this world health crisis, knowledge is key. We are getting briefed constantly by politicians, scientists, and public health-care workers during televised press conferences on how knowledge will help us through this situation.We are seeing a high influx of manuscripts on the topic, describing cohorts, outcomes, case numbers, risk groups, and treatments. As they come in, we read, screen, and evaluate. We see the data every day, and now, new data arrive hourly. I know who falls in the high-risk group. I know what the death rates are, and about containment and mitigation. I know, but I am still afraid. I am afraid because I know. I know that the median age of non-survivors is 69, 70% are male, 67% have comorbidities, 48% have high blood pressure, and 31% have diabetes. I am afraid because I know that the infection rate of inpatients is higher.I have parents in the high-risk age range who live in Germany, while I am in the USA. My mother takes immunosuppressants, and my father has high blood pressure and diabetes and is, overall, not very healthy. He is currently in the hospital for necessary follow-up surgery due to complications from a recent surgery, done at a time when the situation was not as desperate as it is now. I tried to advise them to make the right choices according to the best of my knowledge at that time. Now, we don't have a choice. Now, he needs surgery. The recovery time for his treatment is difficult to estimate, but is probably not less than 2 weeks. He will need to stay in the hospital for the amount of time. I am already hearing from the doctors that they have to clear the wards this week for incoming infected patients. I inquired about room assignment and the answers were, “whatever I say now, might be a lie in 2 h.” The doctors are candid, which I appreciate, but it also makes the severity of the situation more real. Yes, we are in a world health crisis, and, yes, it affects us.Knowledge always empowered me, reassured me. Now, I am worried and afraid. There is so much about the virus and its behaviour that we don't know yet; why are children not as affected, how can we reliably stop spreading, when testing capacity is so limited; and why is testing so delayed and limited at this point? As a journal, it is our responsibility to ensure that the published information is correct. We, our authors, and our reviewers, do our best to get new information out quickly, so it becomes available to everyone. I am trying to be positive, trying to convince myself that it will all be OK. I am trying to put my situation into perspective; I am trying to imagine how my colleagues must feel with families and friends in Italy or China. Or how my colleagues in China and their families must have suffered, and probably still do, during the first waves of the outbreak. It's hard to image, but it has become clear: we are all in this situation together, and I am sure we are all afraid. This is a world health crisis and we should treat it as one. Countries should learn from each other and understand that we must fight this globally. After all, borders don't stop a virus.I am clinging on to the hope that once this is over the world would have learned a lesson. As one, we all must act kindly and respectfully, and with that we will all come out stronger; stronger together. This situation affects all of us and only together as one world we can fight this effectively. Until then, we should be conscious and aware. Help each other and maybe pick up your phone to call your elderly neighbours; they are probably afraid too.
COVID-19: fighting panic with information/-/As governments and health officials worldwide grapple with the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, new developments in the accounting of and response to cases are occurring as part of a swiftly evolving crisis. On Feb 11, 2020, WHO announced an official name for the novel coronavirus disease: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After a stabilisation in the number of new cases, on Feb 13, 2020, China reported nearly 15 000 new COVID-19 cases and 242 deaths in a single day in Hubei province. Previously, tallies had included only laboratory-confirmed cases, and this spike resulted from reclassification of old and probable cases diagnosed with broader clinical criteria, including radiographical confirmation of pneumonia. These revised criteria have been applied only in Hubei province and might provide a clearer picture of the situation at the centre of the outbreak, as the seemingly low previous numbers had caused doubt and consternation about the accuracy of reporting. WHO has indicated that the trajectory of the epidemic has probably remained the same, but it is still unclear which way it will go and the global community must remain vigilant. How key information is relayed to the public during the next phase of the epidemic is critical.With as many as 72 000 cases, the national security strategy for COVID-19 within China has shifted to so-called wartime control measures, putting cities on lockdown and affecting an estimated 760 million people. Regional identification, isolation, and treatment implementation have brought a range of high-tech and militarised approaches. Identification of suspected cases has included extensive efforts in contact tracing, using everything from transportation documents to mobile phone hotlines. Harsh criticism has been levied about the silencing of dissenting voices in China, including Dr Li Wenliang, who was arrested after raising concerns about the virus on social media and subsequently died from COVID-19. Other concerns have been raised about reported measures such as isolation and mass round-ups and quarantining of people at makeshift medical facilities for unspecified durations. Western media have also reported that some residential areas have been sealed off in a grid system, with checkpoints and monitoring of movements, effectively detaining residents. Some internal public transport and external travel to China has been halted via advisories and bans restricting commercial flights. However, there is little evidence that travel bans effectively halt the spread of infectious diseases, and instead they can hamper supply chains, lead to stigma and mistrust, and might violate the principles of the International Health Regulations, as outlined in a Comment published in The Lancet.The international COVID-19 response has been focused on avoiding a pandemic, of which many experts suggest we could be in the early stages. As of Feb 18, 2020, WHO reported 804 total confirmed cases and three deaths in 25 countries outside China. In addition to confirmed cases from travellers to Wuhan and on cruise ships, countries including Singapore, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea have identified clusters of locally transmitted cases. The numbers are small, but the rate of secondary and tertiary transmission is of grave concern and misinformation and fear are rampant. Thousands of medical workers in China are thought to have COVID-19 and, as countries implement scaled up diagnosis and surveillance, the risks from inadequate protective gear and shortages in testing kits are heightened. The first confirmed case in Africa (in Egypt) is worrying, as weak primary health-care systems could undermine preparedness. WHO has called for more investment in surveillance and preparedness, but governments have been slow to take heed. A huge amount of funding has been committed for vaccine platforms but, even with four candidates in development, there is unlikely to be a viable vaccine for at least another 12–18 months. Dozens of clinical trials of treatment are underway, but it will be weeks or months before the results are known.Addressing the Munich Security Conference on Feb 15, 2020, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, “we're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic.” The ease through which inaccuracies and conspiracies can be repeated and perpetuated via social media and conventional outlets puts public health at a constant disadvantage. It is the rapid dissemination of trustworthy information—transparent identification of cases, data sharing, unhampered communication, and peer-reviewed research—which is needed most during this period of uncertainty. There may be no way to prevent a COVID-19 pandemic in this globalised time, but verified information is the most effective prevention against the disease of panic.
Challenges of coronavirus disease 2019/-/Yet again, the world is experiencing a global viral epidemic of zoonotic origin. As of Feb 12, 45 204 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1116 deaths had been reported in 25 countries. The majority of cases and, at the time of writing, all but one death have been in China, despite efforts in the country to halt transmission through shutting down transport, quarantining entire cities, and enforcing the use of face masks. International flights have been cancelled and affected cruise ships quarantined. At this stage, it is unclear whether the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 outbreak will run its course, as SARS-CoV did in 2003, or will become an endemic cause of viral pneumonia.In our January issue we announced the formation of The Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Preparedness for Emerging Epidemic Threats. The Commission will revisit global preparedness planning and assumptions underlying agreements such as the International Health Regulations. It aims to account for new challenges in preparing for and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. These challenges, which are political and institutional, social, environmental, technological, and pathogen-related, are being brought to the foreground by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.One issue is how prepared the world's health systems are to respond to an outbreak of this scale. It's clear the large number of cases of COVID-19 is testing the health system in China. Yet, China was able to build a hospital for affected patients in a matter of days. No other country could mobilise resources and manpower at such speed. While health systems in high-income countries would be stretched by the outbreak, the most devastating effects would be in countries with weak health systems, ongoing conflicts, or existing infectious disease epidemics. In these countries, it is imperative to rapidly detect and contain the virus at points of entry to prevent community transmission and health systems from being overwhelmed. Health authorities in Africa are on high alert for the virus, given the continent's extensive trade and transport links with Asia. The capacity in Africa to screen, isolate, and treat patients and perform contact tracing is being built under the leadership of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO.As in all outbreaks, there is an urgent need to develop effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Several experimental diagnostic platforms are already in use in China and elsewhere. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks. This sequence will allow fine-tuning of existing technologies and development of better diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Several potential treatments have been proposed, including a Janus kinase inibitor known as baricitinib. However, no antiviral treatment has been approved for coronaviruses, and despite two outbreaks of novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, vaccine development is still in its infancy. WHO has announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be available in 18 months, but achieving this will require funding and public interest to be maintained even if the threat level falls.Social media and sensationalist reporting are challenging outbreak response efforts. Misinformation and conspiracy theories spread on social media have generated panic and mistrust among the general public, diverted attention away from the outbreak response, and impeded the activities of health-care workers. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO is tackling the spread of false information with a “four-pronged approach”, including using its WHO Information Network for Epidemics platform to track misinformation in multiple languages and collaborating with social and digital companies such as Facebook, Weibo, and Twitter to filter out false information.How prepared the world was for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will surely be discussed in its aftermath. The initial response in China to contain the virus was applauded by WHO and considered much improved compared with its response to the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Internationally, we have seen rapid generation and sharing of knowledge to the benefit of the outbreak response, but also counterproductive actions by some countries, including limiting trade and shutting of borders, to its detriment. With the increasing frequency of zoonotic spillovers leading to human infections and transmission, it's apparent that pandemic preparedness has become a priority for the global health agenda.
Emerging understandings of 2019-nCoV/-/“There is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency...WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day”, said Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, on Jan 23. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is emerging, but it is not yet a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As we went to press, more than 500 cases have been confirmed in China, as well as in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the US. The virus can cause a severe respiratory illness, like SARS and MERS, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. These characteristics are driving China's urgent public health actions, as well as international concern. But much remains unknown. The pieces of the puzzle that is 2019-nCoV are only now beginning to come together.Today, we publish the first clinical data from individuals confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV from Wuhan, China. Chaolin Huang and colleagues provide comprehensive findings for the first 41 laboratory-confirmed cases. 27 of these 41 cases had direct exposure to the Wuhan seafood market that is thought to be the initial site of infection from an animal source. All had viral pneumonia. The severity of illness is concerning: almost a third of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care; six patients died; five had acute cardiac injury; and four required ventilation.Separately, Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan and colleagues report clinical and microbiological data from a family of six people who had travelled to Wuhan and later presented with pneumonia to Shenzhen Hospital in Guangdong province. Five were identified as infected with 2019-nCoV. Notably, none had been to the Wuhan market, but two had visited a Wuhan hospital. The authors suggest these findings confirm human-to-human transmission. Together, these Articles provide an important initial picture of the clinical spectrum and transmission of this new disease.In an accompanying Comment, Chen Wang, George Gao, and colleagues describe the early sharing of clinical data from the outbreak and emphasise the urgent need for more information about pathogenesis and viral transmission, as well as the pressing need to develop best supportive care and a vaccine. They also caution against overstating the mortality risk, as early reported case-fatality rates may be high due to bias towards detecting severe cases. As David Heymann reflects in another accompanying Comment, publication of these Articles provides peer-reviewed information urgently needed to refine the risk assessment and response, which are happening in real time.China has quickly isolated and sequenced the virus and shared these data internationally. The lessons from the SARS epidemic—where China was insufficiently prepared to implement infection control practices—have been successfully learned. By most accounts, Chinese authorities are meeting international standards and isolating suspected cases and contacts, developing diagnostic and treatment procedures, and implementing public education campaigns. Dr Tedros has praised China for its transparency, data sharing, and quick response. Likewise, WHO has reacted fast and diligently. Despite massive attention and conjecture about the level of threat posed by 2019-nCoV, and whether WHO should declare a PHEIC, the agency's emergency committee has not bowed to pressure to take such a decision until necessary. We commend WHO for its resilience.There are still many gaps in our understanding. The early experiences of these patients and the response to their symptoms before cases were reported remain undocumented. The exposure and possible infection of health workers remain extremely worrying. We will not know for some time the consequences of the quarantine imposed in Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020. Chinese public health authorities are under enormous pressure to make difficult decisions with an incomplete, and rapidly changing, understanding of the epidemic. The shutdowns may seem a drastic step—whether they represent an effective control measure deserves careful investigation and much will likely depend on maintaining trust between authorities and the local population. News media that worsen fears by reporting a “killer virus“ only harm efforts to implement a succesful and safe infection control strategy.Openness and sharing of data are paramount. There are enormous demands for rapid access to information about this new virus, the patients and communities affected, and the response. But equally crucial is the need to ensure that those data are reliable, accurate, and independently scrutinised. As for all public health emergencies, we will be making all related Lancet content fully and freely available.
Q&A: New Tool Ranks Viruses by Their Risk of Jumping to Humans/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, AEROGONDO
W
ell before the world began grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers were already looking out for potential outbreaks from emerging diseases—and trying to stop them. A major hurdle in doing so is understanding which viruses in animals are most likely to make the jump to people. A new, interactive web-based tool, published April 5 in PNAS, uses 32 risk factors and data on more than 500,000 samples taken from nearly 75,000 animals, along with public records of virus detections in wildlife, to rank the chances of spillover among 887 viruses.
Project leader Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist and disease ecologist at the University of California, Davis’s School of Veterinary Medicine, spoke with The Scientist about the “SpillOver” tool that she and her collaborators developed.
The Scientist: Tell me about how this project got started.
Jonna Mazet
UC DAVIS
Jonna Mazet: For more than a decade, I have been the PI and leader of the PREDICT Consortium, which is a very large group of scientists and laboratorians and public health professionals working in more than 35 countries around the world to strengthen systems to identify viruses of concern before they spill over and make people sick. And in doing that work, we were strengthening the systems, but we were also discovering viruses, and we wanted to understand and put some information for the policymakers around the risk of the viruses we were finding.
I think we were a little surprised and disappointed to find that no good information was in the scientific literature about really how to rank these viruses. So we had to start that effort as we were building the systems and as we were discovering viruses. This is a culmination of that huge collaborative project that included at least 400 individuals in the PREDICT project as well as experts from around the world in virology, ecology, epidemiology, and other disciplines.
TS: How did you build the SpillOver tool, and how does it work?
JM: We did intensive literature reviews, and we also mined the minds, if you will, of the scientists and individuals working on the PREDICT project. And then we collated all of the risk factors we could identify as . . . bits of risk in all the scientific papers that have talked about viral spillover risk and even spread. . . . We added to those ones that we were finding in the PREDICT project, because for the most part, the ones we could find in the literature were only around virology and didn’t include the host, the environmental risk component for exposure, or any of the ecology. . . . And then we reached out to scientists all over the world that were working at the top of their fields in this specific area of zoonotic disease and virology and spillover, and we asked them to rank those risk factors that we had identified as well as rank their expertise.
So, for example, if a virologist was ranking one of the virology-oriented risk factors, they may rate themselves as an expert. But if they were looking at one that was more in the ecology realm, they might rate themselves a little lower in their expertise. And we use their rankings as well as their self-assigned expertise to then look at all of the risk factors and put together a program—equations, basically—to come up with a weighted score for each risk factor. And then we used that to then find the data for all of the known zoonotics that were found first in wildlife and transmitted to people as kind of a gut check of our ranking system to see if it was working. And then once we found that the tool looked to be functioning very well for historical spillovers, we then ranked the viruses that the PREDICT project found.
See “Predicting Future Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks”
TS: Where did SARS-CoV-2 rank?
JM: When we were first working on this, obviously there was no SARS-CoV-2 that we knew of—it existed, but it hadn’t been identified yet. So initially, it wasn’t even in our system, but of course as we were coming to put the final touches on the manuscript and the tool, we did add SARS-CoV-2 . . . with all other viruses that were coming out in the literature and in GenBank and GISAID and others.
When we added SARS-CoV-2, it ranked number two of the known zoonotics—[second to Lassa virus, found among rodents in West Africa and which causes hemorrhagic fever in people]. That’s ranking for its ability and likelihood to spill over again, and it has a bit of a nod to pandemic potential with our risk-ranking system. And I think that’s very telling. . . . Obviously, it’s a terrible virus that’s caused the pandemic, so it should rank very highly, as it does. And the reason that it’s not ranking even higher as number one is that it hasn’t been studied, until it spilled over.
Our goal is to actually rank viruses and study them before they spill over, so that we have them ranked on a watch list, so that countries that have these viruses can create watch lists and do the surveillance and risk mitigation before they spill over. As more and more information is coming out about the host and the distribution of SARS-CoV-2—it’s obviously worldwide in people but we’re interested in its distribution in wildlife and the potential reservoir hosts—I think it might even go up to number one.

J&J COVID-19 Vaccinations Resume After Temporary Shutdowns/-/ABOVE: Dicks Sporting Goods Park near Denver, where mass vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused on Wednesday after 11 people who received the shot felt unwell

T
hree vaccination sites, one in Colorado and two in North Carolina, briefly paused administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine against COVID-19 earlier this week after a small percentage of recipients experienced adverse reactions. The shots resumed after investigations by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the incidents were consistent with the vaccine’s known side effects.  
On Wednesday afternoon (April 7), a mass vaccination clinic at a baseball stadium outside of Denver shut down after 11 people felt unwell within 15 minutes, according to The Denver Post. Their reactions included nausea, dizziness, and fainting; nine people were treated at the site with juice and water, while two were taken to the hospital. More than 1,700 people were vaccinated at the site that day. 
“After reviewing each patient’s symptoms, analyzing other vaccinations from the same lot of the vaccine and speaking with the CDC to confirm our findings, we are confident in saying that there is no reason for concern,” said Eric France, the chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment, in a statement released the following day. “We are committed to making sure every community clinic is well-staffed with medical professionals who take patient safety with the utmost seriousness, just as they did at yesterday’s clinic.”  
Yesterday, a similar incident occurred at a mass vaccination site at a sports arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, that had administered more than 2,300 Johnson & Johnson shots. There, 18 people experienced reactions, four of whom were taken to hospitals. The Wake County Public Health department released a statement later that day saying that it had investigated the incident together with the CDC and that the federal agency recommended moving ahead with the vaccines.  
“We have been administering J&J vaccine here in Wake County since early March, and nationally, more than 4.5 million people have received the J&J shots,” Wake County Medical Director Kim McDonald says in the statement. “Reactions are expected, but what’s important is that our patients are here with us being monitored, and medical personnel are right here in our clinics to respond to these rare events.” 
“There is no greater priority than the safety and well-being of the people we serve. When we receive reports of adverse events in individuals receiving our medicines and vaccines, we collect necessary information and carefully assess the events,” Johnson & Johnson spokesperson Lisa Cannellos writes in an email to The News & Observer in Raleigh. 
David Wohl, a University of North Carolina School of Medicine infectious disease physician who helps run another clinic that also paused Johnson & Johnson injections yesterday, tells the News & Observer that more people at that site report feeling lightheaded and faint with that vaccine than with the other COVID-19 vaccines the clinic administers. He suggests that may be because people who dread vaccines are seeking out the single-dose Johnson & Johnson version. “We’re having a lot of people who are taking the J&J vaccine because they don’t want two shots because they don’t like needles,” he says.  
“Feeling anxious or faint can be common when receiving a vaccination or any kind of medical procedure, like a blood draw,” says state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy in the Colorado health department’s statement. “When you go to your vaccine appointment, bring a beverage and a snack or a friend or family member to help offer some reassurance.”
Blood Clots a Very Rare Side Effect of AstraZeneca Vaccine: EMA/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JETCITYIMAGE
T
he European Medicines Agency has concluded that certain unusual types of blood clots are a very rare side effect of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, according to a statement the agency posted yesterday (April 7). These clots, which are associated with low blood platelet counts, have been reported in connection with a handful of deaths among the more than 34 million people who have received the vaccine in Europe and the UK, prompting several countries to alter their immunization rollouts in recent weeks.
Sabine Straus, chair of the committee that produced the EMA report, said at a press conference yesterday that the rate of cases appeared to be about 1 in 100,000 vaccinated people. According to the statement, the agency based its analysis on nearly 90 cases of blood clots, 18 of which were fatal. “The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare,” the statement notes, “and the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.”
Concerns about blood clots in people administered the AstraZeneca vaccine surfaced around a month ago, after several people in Europe died following vaccination. Multiple European countries had put immunization programs using the vaccine on hold by the middle of March, although the EMA and several other health organizations, as well as AstraZeneca itself, subsequently concluded that the cases were not linked to immunization.
See “Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine on Hold in Some Countries”
The EMA now concludes, based on current data, that the vaccine may be linked to the clots. Most cases have been reported in “women under 60 years of age within 2 weeks of vaccination,” the new EMA statement notes, adding that specific risk factors for clots “have not been confirmed.” European countries currently have a patchwork of guidelines about use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with some countries recommending its use only in people over a certain age, and others halting use of the vaccine altogether.
See “AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 Shot Completely Prevented Severe Disease”
Agencies other than the EMA have drawn slightly different conclusions about the exact risks associated with the vaccine. In a press release yesterday, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency put the incidence of blood clots at 4 in 1 million (or 1 in 250,000), while government advisors with the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended that people aged 18–29 should be offered other COVID-19 vaccines when available, The Guardian reports.
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, issued a statement yesterday saying that there is insufficient evidence to draw a causal link. “Based on current information, a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is considered plausible but is not confirmed,” the statement says.
It adds that “in extensive vaccination campaigns, it is normal for countries to identify potential adverse events following immunization. This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but they must be investigated to ensure that any safety concerns are addressed quickly.”
Most Kids with MIS-C Report Few or No COVID-19 Symptoms: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MAHMUD013
S
ince the COVID-19 pandemic began last year, more than 3,000 kids have been diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a serious condition linked to coronavirus infection that involves organ dysfunction, low blood pressure, fever, and other symptoms, and 36 children have died from it. 
According to an analysis of hundreds of cases of MIS-C published in JAMA Pediatrics on April 6, most of the patients didn’t report having been ill with their prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before developing the syndrome. Of 1,075 kids with MIS-C for whom the authors had information regarding their bout with COVID-19, just 265 reported a preceding sickness, and low blood pressure, shock, cardiac dysfunction, and admission to the ICU were more prevalent among those who didn’t.
“It means primary-care pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion for this because Covid is so prevalent in the society and children often have asymptomatic disease as their initial Covid infection,” Jennifer Blumenthal, a pediatric intensivist and infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital who was not involved in the study, tells The New York Times.
Doctors first recognized MIS-C’s association with COVID-19 last spring, noting that patients sometimes had mild or asymptomatic cases of the infection beforehand. “They had the infection, they got through it. And then all of a sudden . . . they can have this collapse in their bodies a few weeks later,” Alvaro Moreira, a neonatologist at the University of Texas Health San Antonio, described to The Scientist in September.
In the latest study, physicians from health agencies around the US examined 1,733 reports of MIS-C. Diagnoses peaked in early May, early August, and December, following peaks in COVID-19 cases by two to five weeks. 
The patients commonly experienced fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, rash, diarrhea, and conjunctival hyperemia, when the blood vessels in the eye appear red and dilated. Half of the children had low blood pressure, and nearly one-third developed cardiac complications. Around 58 percent were admitted for intensive care, and 24 patients in the study died.
Another study published last month found that about 10 percent of children hospitalized with MIS-C presented with acute kidney injury.
It’s not clear why some children develop MIS-C. The authors write in their paper, “Most MIS-C illnesses are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 with hyperinflammation coinciding with peak antibody production several weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.” A study from last year found that kids with MIS-C are immunologically different from adults with severe COVID-19; in particular, the adults had higher levels of particular cytokines involved in fighting infections.
The risk of developing MIS-C remains very low for kids. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) this month, 3.47 million children have tested positive for COVID-19. Sean O’Leary, the vice chairman of the infectious diseases committee for the AAP, tells the Associated Press that most children “respond very well to treatment and the vast majority get completely better.”
Scientists Reverse Engineer mRNA Sequence of Moderna Vaccine/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, INSJOY
L
eftover drops in vials of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine allowed a group of researchers from Stanford University to determine the sequence of the mRNA for SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein that is used in the immunization, Motherboard reported March 29. The sequence has been posted on the open-access website GitHub.
“Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has substantial benefit in design of improved clinical tools and precise diagnostics,” the authors write in their post. They explain that knowing the vaccine’s sequence will allow diagnostic labs to more easily differentiate between RNA from the vaccine versus that from an actual viral infection.
“As the vaccine has been rolling out, these sequences have begun to show up in many different investigational and diagnostic studies,” the researchers tell Motherboard by email. “Knowing these sequences and having the ability to differentiate them from other RNAs in analyzing future biomedical data sets is of great utility.”
The mRNA sequence for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was made available to the public in December by the World Health Organization, with the company confirming its accuracy. This gave laboratory scientists the ability to compare what they were seeing in patient samples to the vaccine. Now, researchers will be able to check for markers of the Moderna vaccine as well. The sequences for both vaccines are included in the document posted on GitHub, allowing for side-by-side comparisons of the two.
In order to determine the mRNA transcript’s identity in the Moderna vaccine, the Stanford team collected droplets from the vials after all of the doses were given out. They then obtained permission from the US Food and Drug Administration to perform tests on these tiny leftovers.
According to Motherboard, the team received permission from the FDA to publish the sequence, but couldn’t connect with anyone at Moderna. “We did contact Moderna a couple of weeks ago to indicate that we were hoping to include the sequence in a publication and asking if there was anything that we should reference with respect to this . . . no response or objection from them, so we assume that everyone is busy doing important work.”
Although the mRNA sequence has been made available, it isn’t the full recipe for the vaccine. Moderna’s intellectual property behind the rest of the formulation and complex manufacturing is still protected, Gizmodo reports.
Pharma Looks to Inflammasome Inhibitors as All-Around Therapies/-/ABOVE: Once activated, the NLRP3 inflammasome (illustrated) triggers a suite of pathways that may play an important role in many different diseases.
ARTWORK REPRODUCED WITH PERMISSION FROM PROFESSOR KATE SCHRODER, THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND
E
very morning of his life, no matter what he did, a young British man woke up with a fever, a headache, a rash on his trunk and limbs, joint pain, and ever-worsening deafness. His doctors had diagnosed him with a rare illness called Muckle-Wells syndrome, in which chronic inflammation rages out of control; no treatment had been able to cure his symptoms.
Then, in 2001, researchers in California discovered the genetic explanation for his disease: a mutation in a gene called CIAS1 (since renamed NALP3 and then NLRP3), which was later found to cause the resulting protein to be constantly activated. Around the same time, a group of scientists at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland found that NALP1/NLRP1, a protein from the same family, forms a large intracellular complex called an inflammasome, which helps generate the IL-1β cytokine, triggering a cascade of inflammation. Taken together, the findings suggested that in Muckle-Wells, inflammasomes made with NLRP3 instead of NLRP1 were constantly forming and could be producing huge amounts of IL-1β, causing the man’s illness. So researchers Philip Hawkins of the Royal Free Hospital and University College Medical School (now UCL Medical School) and Michael McDermott of St. Bartholomew’s and the Royal London School of Medicine (he’s now at the University of Leeds) gave the man an existing arthritis drug called anakinra (Kineret), which blocks the IL-1 receptor. 
There’s obviously a whole portfolio of indications where inhib­iting the inflammasome could make a lot of sense.
—Guido Junge, Novar­tis Institutes for BioMedical Research
By the time the man received treatment in 2002, at 22 years old, “he had experienced fever, flu-like symptoms for his entire life, that was his normalcy, he didn’t know what it is to feel well,” recalls Fabio Martinon, who helped discover the NLRP1 inflammasome when he was a PhD student in the late Jürg Tschopp’s lab at Lausanne. “When they started to inject him with the anti–IL-1 drug, within [a] few hours the skin rashes on his body were gone, the fever was gone—that was kind of a game-changer and kind of spectacular.” Martinon, now faculty at the university, later helped confirm that elevated NLRP3 inflammasome activity had indeed caused the British man’s symptoms. 
Fast forward almost two decades from the man’s treatment, and the field of inflammasome research is booming. Studies in animals have suggested that the NLRP3 inflammasome’s impact can be felt far beyond rare genetic diseases such as Muckle-Wells. Microparticles that accumulate in tissue as a result of modern Western lifestyles and longer lives may activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, stoking inflammation and exacerbating or even causing dozens of diseases of aging and lifestyle, from Alzheimer’s disease and cancer to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
These developments have attracted the interest of biotech companies, too. Unlike the injected IL-1 receptor blockers that the British man received, which can dampen broader immune responses needed to fight infection, NLRP3 inhibitors could be taken orally and only inhibit NLRP3-mediated inflammation, offering a more practical, more effective, and safer therapy. Since 2016, several small pharmaceutical companies have developed targeted NLRP3 inhibitors, and in the past year, large companies have scooped up those smaller companies in huge deals or have started developing inhibitors of their own. Torreya Capital’s Biopharmaceutical Sector Update Market Outlook ranked “Inflammasome Science” as one of the top five biopharma events of 2020.
While no NLRP3-targeting drugs have hit the market just yet, “the science is unequivocal,” says Kate Schroder, an inflammasome researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia and one of the co-inventors on inflammasome inhibitor patents originally licensed to the Ireland-based company Inflazome (since acquired by Roche). “It’s really clear that this is an important pathway for human health, and if we can drug it, we will be able to improve a whole bunch of different diseases, some of which are diseases for which we don’t have any disease-modifying drug.”
The inflammasome’s early days
In the years since the discovery of the NLRP1 inflammasome in 2001, researchers have learned that there are up to 15 types of inflammasomes (though only eight are well established), each responding to a unique danger signal. Most of these complexes, including the NLRP1, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes, can be activated by pathogens. NLRP3, by contrast, seems to be activated primarily in the presence of accumulated intracellular debris, including cholesterol crystals (which lead to atherosclerosis), amyloid-β particles (which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease), and tobacco smoke particulates (which contribute to lung disease), among others. 
Although the precise mechanisms are still unclear, scientists have established the basics of how individual NLRP3 proteins come together to create an NLRP3 inflammasome. First, phagocytosing white blood cells such as macrophages engulf particles or crystals, which damage these cells’ plasma and lysosomal membranes. This causes potassium ions to move out of the macrophages, which in turn activates individual NLRP3 proteins in those cells. Once active, each NLRP3 associates with several others, forming a snowflake shape; then, so-called adaptor proteins assemble into long filaments that dangle from the NLRP3 wheel, resulting in a huge protein complex: the NLRP3 inflammasome can be the size of one of the cell’s organelles. 
“They’re quite beautiful,” says Matt Cooper, a chemist at the University of Queensland. “It looks a bit like a Doric column with a starfish on the top.” On the surface of this complex, pairs of caspase-1 enzymes bind to each other, become active, and cleave precursor molecules for IL-1β and IL-18, transforming them into their mature inflammatory forms, which are then secreted from the cell. Caspase-1 also processes other compounds that trigger a form of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis.
“NLRP3’s major role is to sense things like particles and crystals that need to be digested by the body, but which one cell can’t cope with,” says Schroder. “It makes sense for that cell to ring the alarm by triggering IL-1 production, which recruits new cells to the site of the crystals or particles so you have a whole bunch of phagocytes to clean up the mess.” Disease can result, she suggests, when there are so many of these particles that they keep activating NLRP3 in new cells even after the previous cells die, relentlessly ramping up inflammation.

Completed Phase 1 and Phase 1b in patients with heart failure and Phase 2a in patients with acute gout flares. A Phase 2 trial for people with moderate COVID-19 symptoms is ongoing, and the company is planning a Phase 2 trial in late-stage melanoma, along with an approved immunotherapy.
Drugging the inflammasome
For years after the inflammasome’s initial discovery, the search for drugs that target it yielded no promising leads, Cooper says. “Big pharma all went and screened their libraries of drugs and said, can we find an inhibitor? But no one could.” 
Several years ago, that began to change. Luke O’Neill, an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin, was one of the people searching for an NLRP3 inhibitor, with colleagues at his company Opsona. He knew that a scientist named Chris Gabel had been working at Pfizer in the late 1990s on a molecule called CRID3, which appeared to block IL-1β production. O’Neill was intrigued and in 2012 teamed up with Cooper to study the compound. They were eventually able to show that CRID3, which the team renamed MCC950, was a highly selective and potent inhibitor of NLRP3. Together with Schroder’s group and others, the researchers filed patents and published a paper on the compound in 2015 in Nature Medicine. 
Soon, independent teams of researchers began showing that MCC950 improved symptoms and biomarkers of disease in animal models of Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, stroke, and many other conditions. In a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease, for example, inhibiting NLRP3 with MCC950 protected against neurodegeneration and reversed the animals’ motor deficits.
Meanwhile O’Neill and Cooper set out to raise venture capital to create the company Inflazome, based on the work their teams had done on MCC950 and derivatives. But it wasn’t easy. “Back then, people thought you were making it up. Like, it can’t possibly be true that one protein can mediate all these different diseases,” says Schroder, who met in 2015 and 2016 with potential investors to explain inflammasome biology. In the end, though, Fountain Healthcare Partners, headquartered in Ireland, and Novartis Venture Funds provided Inflazome with $17 million in series A funding, and Cooper moved to Dublin to be CEO, with O’Neill as chief scientific officer (CSO).

Delving more into MCC950’s mechanism of action, Schroder’s lab, along with another group, recently determined that the compound inhibits NLRP3 by directly binding with a particular protein domain in a way that prevents NLRP3 from opening up into its active form. Although it worked well in animals, MCC950 raised blood levels of a liver enzyme in early human trials, so the team instead used it as a starting point to develop new compounds. 
By the time they sold Inflazome to Roche last fall, the researchers had developed two drugs, Inzomelid (for diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) and Somalix (for diseases in the rest of the body). Both have completed Phase 1 clinical trials for safety and tolerability, and Inzomelid also showed positive results in a small Phase 1b trial in patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), a group of diseases (including Muckle-Wells syndrome) in which mutations cause NLRP3 to be activated all the time. Last July, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Inzomelid orphan drug status for the treatment of CAPS. A few months later, Roche bought the company and its portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors for 380 million euros ($451 million), plus additional milestone payments. 
O’Neill and Cooper weren’t the only ones looking to commercialize drugs that target the NLRP3 inflammasome. New York–based Olatec Therapeutics, for example, had been working since 2011 on a compound called dapansutrile that later turned out to be a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, and in 2016, several companies used the Nature Medicine paper to launch searches for their own inhibitors based on MCC950’s structure. Like Olatec, NodThera (where Chris Gabel is now VP of Biology), IFM Tre (recently bought by Novartis), and others have now moved compounds into Phase 1 trials; some companies already have Phase 2 trials underway. (See table “Inflammation on Trial” above.) 
“This is truly the new frontier,” says Charles Dinarello, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and co-CSO and chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at Olatec; the company’s compound dapansutrile recently advanced through early-stage trials for heart failure and acute gout flares, and will also be studied in late-stage melanoma patients. “Now the big challenge is to go further, crossing into cancer with a safe-in-humans nontoxic drug.” Olatec and, separately, Novartis are even testing their respective drugs as possible treatments for COVID-19. (See “NLRP3 and COVID-19” below.)
Too good to be true?
While inhibiting NLRP3 in humans seems promising to the researchers who spoke with The Scientist, more late-stage clinical data are needed to demonstrate that NLRP3 inhibitors can halt the progression of various diseases of aging and lifestyle. “There is a small issue here: there are very few studies in humans on NLRP3 and the inflammasome. Most come from mice,” says inflammasome discoverer Martinon, who has no stake in any company. “Clearly there are differences in the regulation and the role of these proteins in [mice] and humans. So we will see what the clinical trials will tell us in humans.” Larger trials could also provide more information about possible toxicities. 
Martinon notes too that scientists still don’t have a complete understanding of the precise molecular structure of the enormous inflammasome complex, making mechanistic studies challenging. “We still don’t really understand how it gets activated,” he says. Studies also suggest that NLRP3 inflammasomes play a role in adaptive immunity, an effect that needs to be further studied.
Still, most inflammasome researchers are extremely hopeful. “There’s obviously a whole portfolio of indications where inhibiting the inflammasome could make a lot of sense,” says Guido Junge, who oversees inflammasome clinical activities at Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. 
Schroder agrees. “It may not be our compounds that get to the clinic first, or it may not be our compounds that get to the clinic at all,” she says. “But there are so many different compounds out there now that are being developed by so many different companies to inhibit NLRP3. As long as some of them get out into the clinic, I’ll be delighted because it’s all about helping the patients in the end.” 
NLRP3 and COVID-19 
One of the most dangerous phases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be when the immune system launches an inflammatory over-reaction called a cytokine storm, releasing a blast of cytokines into the bloodstream that can damage organs and may eventually kill the patient.
Damaris Skouras, founder and CEO of New York–based Olatec Therapeutics, says that early in the pandemic, one of the first things the data revealed globally was the various comorbidities that increase risk of hospitalization and death: high BMI, diabetes, cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and older age, among others. She says that research has already established that the ill effects associated with many of these conditions are modulated by dysregulated IL-1β inflammation, which is then exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Olatec’s co–Chief Scientific Officer Charles Dinarello, for example, showed activation of NLRP3 and associated inflammation in blood samples from patients early in the course of infection with SARS-CoV-2.  
Two companies have launched Phase 2 trials with NLRP3 inhibitors to treat COVID-19 patients. In January, Novartis completed its randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter study using its compound DFV890 on 143 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and suffering from pneumonia and impaired respiratory function. A Novartis spokesperson says in an emailed statement that the company is analyzing the data now.
Olatec has a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the safety and efficacy of dapansutrile for COVID-19 patients early in disease progression and not sick enough to be hospitalized. Launched last December, the trial has a target of 80 subjects and aims to test if dapansutrile will inhibit IL-1β and head off the cytokine storm. “We are addressing an unmet need for an ambulatory treatment for those most at risk to keep them out of the hospital, keep them safe, keep them at home,” says Skouras, “and most important, keep them from progression into severe COVID.”

Securing the Antibody Supply Chain through Recombinant Antibody Technology: A COVID-19 Case Study/-/FREE Webinar

For scientific and diagnostic laboratories, a secure supply chain for high-quality reagents is critical for weathering unforeseen circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, recombinant antibody technology has been reserved for companies developing novel biologics. The technology mitigates manufacturing and supply risks by “digitizing” antibody assets and guaranteeing long-term reproducible production. Recombinant technology also increases the ability to engineer existing antibodies for any specific bio-physical requirements that might arise, as producing antibodies by transient transfection enables rapid reformatting.
In this webinar brought to you by Sartorius, Nicholas Hutchings will describe how recombinant antibody technology came to the rescue during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 antibodies were quickly produced and tested in a variety of formats so that researchers would have the tools they needed to investigate the virus and develop diagnostic assays and treatments. This process can be mimicked for future emergency scenarios to speed up pandemic responses.

Pfizer Vaccine Induces Immune Structures Key to Lasting Immunity/-/ABOVE: A lymph node with B cells labeled yellow and CD4+ T cells in blue.
FLICKR, NIAID
J
ust like any skilled workers, many antibody-producing cells require training to do their job proficiently. That education happens in germinal centers, structures in the lymph nodes that form upon infection or vaccination, then disappear after a few weeks. Although our bodies have some antibody-spewing plasmablasts at the ready when they first encounter a new virus, better, longer-lasting antibody-making cells emerge from these lymphoid boot camps.
In what’s described as the dark zone of the germinal center based on its appearance under a microscope, B cells swiftly multiply and diversify into clones that carry differently shaped antibodies. They then drift into the “light zone,” where they face examination by specialized T cells that test their ability to recognize viral protein. This test is tough; imperfect clones are sent back to the dark zone for refinement or are eliminated. The result of this natural section on fast track is a number of winning clones that stick very tightly to viral protein and are immortalized into long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells, which provide antibody protection for years or even decades. This schooling in germinal centers is crucial to developing lasting immunity, whether by natural infection or vaccines.
A preprint posted to Research Square on March 10 shows that a dozen people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine produced potent germinal center responses—the first demonstration that an mRNA vaccine triggers the formation of these key structures in people. Although there was no reason to suspect that the Pfizer vaccine wouldn’t induce germinal centers, proof has so far been elusive. The research provides reassurance that vaccinees will likely have long-lived antibody immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
This is what the vaccine is meant to do.
—Ali Ellebedy, Washington University School of Medicine
“I was hoping this response would be there . . . so I was very excited,” remarks immune engineer Ankur Singh of Georgia Tech, who recently got his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and who wasn’t involved in the research. “I think this is quite an interesting finding [that] a lipid particle–based mRNA vaccine is so nicely inducing these responses, because it has never been shown up until now that it was even a possibility.”
Feeling limited in studying the human immune response just by looking at blood samples, immunologist Ali Ellebedy of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and colleagues began tracking germinal center reactions a few years ago. Guided by ultrasound, they used fine needles to extract cells from the lymph nodes of people who had received a seasonal influenza vaccine with the viral protein hemagglutinin. In that study, they found hemagglutinin-binding germinal center B cells amassing in some participants, sometimes for up to nine weeks after vaccination. When the new COVID-19 vaccines rolled out, the team was ready to investigate whether they would have the same effect. (Ellebedy and some coauthors disclosed various relationships with pharmaceutical companies, including active collaborations with Pfizer, a position on the scientific advisory board of Moderna, and having received funding from both pharma companies. The Washington University School of Medicine has filed a patent application related to the new research.)
See “Some COVID-19 Patients Lack Key Structures for Antibody Creation”
The team tracked 32 healthy adults as they received both jabs of the Pfizer vaccine, three weeks apart, into their upper arm muscle. The participants’ blood samples revealed—as expected—a short-lived plasmablast response that peaked a week after the second shot and began declining three weeks later. That was accompanied by a flush of antibodies that were effective in neutralizing a SARS-CoV-2 variant in the US, the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the UK, and a SARS-CoV-2 virus engineered to mimic the spike protein of the B.1.315 variant discovered in South Africa. Notably, neutralizing antibody concentrations were generally higher in a subset of vaccine recipients who had been previously infected with the real virus, suggesting they have a higher degree of protection.
Immune training underway
To see if the usual plasmablast wave was followed by a germinal center response, the team extracted cells from participants’ armpit lymph nodes at multiple timepoints and used flow cytometry to quantify the proportion of germinal center–resident B cells there, which carry specific cell markers. Fluorescently labeled probes were used to isolate cells that target SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein, which is produced by the mRNA vaccine.

SHARLENE TEEFEY FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY RADIOLOGY 
Sure enough, the researchers observed spike-binding germinal center B cells in all participants three weeks after the first jab. The proportion of these cells increased after the second shot and stayed at high levels in most participants for at least seven weeks—a good sign that memory B cells and plasma cells are being generated. The longer germinal center reactions go on, the more rigorous training antibody-producing cells are getting. “You get higher affinity B cells, but you get also more B cells differentiating into the memory B cells and [a] long-lived plasma cell pool,” he says. “This is what the vaccine is meant to do.”
The fact that the mRNA vaccine elicits a strong germinal center response “is not a huge surprise,” Ellebedy says; a good plasmablast response is usually a good indication that the germinal center reactions will follow. What was surprising is that the response appeared to be stronger than they’d previously observed in the influenza study, when only three of eight participants’ lymph nodes harbored hemagglutinin-binding germinal center B cells. And in those three, “the magnitude of the response was modest,” Ellebedy recalls.
With the mRNA vaccine, “in every node we looked at, we found very nice, beautiful germinal center responses specific to the spike,” Ellebedy says. He suspects that the difference may have to do with the fact that the seasonal influenza vaccine they investigated doesn’t contain efficacy-boosting compounds known as adjuvants. Instead, the vaccine essentially only consists of a piece of protein, selected for inducing a strong immune response, and relies heavily on the fact that many people already have pre-existing immunity to influenza in order to produce protection. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, in contrast, contains adjuvants, and mRNA itself can elicit immune reactions and is potentially translated into larger quantities of protein than those contained in the flu vaccine, Ellebedy hypothesizes.
The results are in line with recently published mouse data that suggest a stronger germinal center response after a single shot of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine than to a recombinant protein vaccine with an adjuvant. Although the germinal center responses to non-mRNA vaccines haven’t yet been tested in people, Ellebedy’s data underscore the potency of mRNA vaccines, he says.
Unexpected, valuable antibody types discovered
To immunologist Ziv Shulman of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, the team’s data are a good sign that the vaccine is having its intended effect in people. What he finds surprising, he says, is the additional discovery of an unexpected type of spike-targeting plasmablast in the recipients’ lymph nodes. In this study, while most plasmablasts produced IgG antibodies—which circulate in the blood—a substantial portion made IgA antibodies, which are normally produced in infected mucosal tissues, such as in the gut or nose.
It’s entirely unexpected to see IgA antibodies produced after a vaccine is injected into muscle tissue in the body’s periphery—he’d only expect that for vaccines that are administered through mucosal tissues, such as the mouth or nose, says Shulman, who was not involved in the study. But their presence is a good thing. Most likely they will migrate into mucosal tissues and provide protection there—which IgG antibodies are also capable of doing, but not as efficiently. “[The IgAs] could block entry of the virus at the site where it goes into our body,” says Shulman. The exact source of those IgA-expressing plasmablasts—for instance, whether they originate from germinal center reactions induced by the vaccine or from reawakened memory immune cells from previous common cold–causing coronavirus infections—is unclear, he notes.
The findings contrast with an autopsy analysis published last year that reported that some severely infected COVID-19 patients don’t develop germinal centers, causing some concern among researchers that this would portend poor vaccine efficacy. Singh notes that immune memory from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be very variable. “There’s more consistency in vaccine-mediated immunity. “I would rather get [immunity] this way than going through the infectious way.”
Both researchers praise the team’s method of examining ongoing germinal center reactions in living individuals. “This is really not a simple procedure to do on healthy people,” Shulman adds. Of course, questions remain, such as how long the germinal center reactions last beyond seven weeks, and whether these reactions do in fact produce long-lived plasma B cells. Those cells migrate to the bone marrow and persist there for decades, secreting antibodies continuously into the bloodstream like a barrage of missiles. “A lingering question is, are we going to get [the vaccine] every year like a flu shot, or are we going to generate a long-term response?” Singh asks.
A week after the second shot, Ellebedy’s team took a closer look at the antibodies produced by some of the spike-targeting germinal center B cells. Interestingly, a few also reacted with the spike proteins of other, common cold–causing coronaviruses. Not only did the vaccine likely create new cells, but it apparently also re-enlisted veteran memory B cells from previous infections back into germinal center training.
See “Common Cold Coronaviruses Tied to Less Severe COVID-19 Cases”
The finding could help guide scientists toward an antibody that can neutralize all coronaviruses, and a vaccine that protects against all of them, Ellebedy notes. “That would be a great antibody to find.”

Moncef Slaoui Fired by GSK Amid Sexual Harassment Claims/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 13THREEPHOTOGRAPHY

oncef Slaoui, the former head of the US government’s COVID-19 vaccine initiative called Operation Warp Speed, has been fired from the Galvani Bioelectronics Board of Directors following an investigation into sexual harassment allegations. GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceutical company that jointly oversees Galvani and formerly employed Slaoui directly, received a complaint from an employee in February. According to a March 24 statement from the company, the investigation substantiated the claims and resulted in Slaoui’s dismissal as Galvani’s chair.   
Slaoui led vaccine development at GSK until 2017. The letter sent by the victim to the GSK Board claimed that Slaoui engaged in harassing behavior many years ago during his tenure there. The company did not share specifics on the nature of the harassment or a narrower window on when it happened.
“Dr. Slaoui’s behaviours are wholly unacceptable. They represent an abuse of his leadership position, violate company policies, and are contrary to the strong values that define GSK’s culture,” the statement reads. “Sexual harassment and any abuse of leadership position are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.”
In May 2020, Slaoui was chosen by then-President Donald Trump to head up Operation Warp Speed. Shortly after taking the role, Slaoui came under fire as he held onto his investments in pharmaceutical companies including Moderna, which exploded in value from $2.4 million to $12.4 million in a matter of days, though the terms of his contract did not require him to disclose any conflicts of interest. The New York Times reported in May 2020 that Slaoui sold the Moderna shares and said any profits would be donated to cancer research. He resigned from his role in January at the request of the incoming Biden administration, CNBC reports.
In addition to the press release from the company, GSK CEO Emma Walmsley sent an open letter to the company’s employees that was then shared on Twitter, expressing her frustration with Slaoui’s actions.
“On a personal level, I am shocked and angry about all of this, but I’m resolute,” she writes. “I want to be clear that sexual harassment is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.”
Walmsley’s letter included resources for employees to report untoward behavior related to Slaoui or any others, along with support for anyone upset by the situation. As an added measure, Walmsley announced that the research and development lab in Rockville, Maryland, that currently bears Slaoui’s name will be renamed.
Q&A: Data Gaps Hinder Monitoring of SARS-COV-2 Variants/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DKOSIG
M
artha Nelson, a senior biologist in the Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tracks variants of SARS-CoV-2 in as close to real time as possible. But linking viral genetic sequence data with details about the person that sample came from is often impossible, yet those details are crucial to understanding how the virus is spreading.
“It’s been painfully slow because there is no national system for data sharing and piles of red tape to get patient metadata needed to make a genetic sequence meaningful,” Nelson writes to The Scientist in an email. “The CDC has been leading efforts to get US sequencing higher in terms of volume, but the lack of coordination and sharing of data makes the information fragmented and hard to interpret.”
What would be ideal, she says, is marrying sequence data with contact tracing information, but for now, she and her colleagues are forced to piece together what geographic and clinical information they can to trace SARS-CoV-2 variants around the country. The Scientist spoke with Nelson about her research and the barriers it faces.
The Scientist: What is your role in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in the US, and what are your primary goals in this work?
Martha Nelson
AARON SCHWARTZBARD
Martha Nelson: My goals are to understand how these variants are transmitting in the US. We can see that there’s a certain proportion of these viruses that comprise a proportion of the US population of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. And for some of these variants, it’s still very small. But that proportion only tells you so much. It doesn’t tell you how these viruses are getting here, how well they’re spreading, how quickly they’re spreading in different places, how much they’re spreading across different regions of the US. And that’s what we can infer from the genetic data, from the genetic sequences, by seeing how variants that we see in different states, in different cities, how genetically related they are, whether they’re part of the same transmission lineage, or whether they appear to be separate introductions.
Even though there’s much less travel globally and within the US right now because of the pandemic, there’s still a lot of people flying across the world, and we can see how these variants have been introduced multiple times, probably through international travel.
Then our question is, once they get here, how much are they spreading? Do they seem to be outcompeting other viruses? . . . Do they threaten our vaccination strategy? My job is really to crunch the genetic data and understand what that means for the course of the epidemic trajectory in the US.
TS: You told me in an email that progress had been ‘painfully slow.’ Can you elaborate on the challenges to date?
MN: In terms of sheer volume of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, the US is number two behind the UK, and there’s a large volume of genetic data coming out of our labs. . . . But at the same time there’s been some areas that are really particular struggles for the US, and some of that just relates to the way that our country is decentralized, and the way that data is collected ad hoc, by academic groups, by public health labs. And there’s no central coordination or funding stream.
GISAID and GenBank are these databases where you can very easily access the genetic sequence. . . . What’s really important is to put that genetic sequence in context, and to do that you need to know a bit about the person that it was collected from. It would be really helpful, for example, if you see variants that have all been collected from a certain state—are those all from a single household in that state? Is that one tiny transmission chain? Or are those collected from multiple different counties separated by hundreds of miles that could be something that’s really widespread across the entire state?
There’s protections of patient privacy, but the real barrier is to sharing it at a national level, so that you can get a national picture, or even a regional picture, and connect data that’s been collected by different groups and get a more holistic picture of what’s happening with these variants in the country. And that’s what’s really hard to do.
TS: Where is your data coming from?
MN: Some of it is by people who I happen to know who have sequenced viruses from one particular population. A lot of the data is from GISAID, and it is publicly available data. I try and use as much data that’s available as I can to get a larger picture of what’s happening across the US. But [when it comes to data sharing], it’s still really hard to get the additional data.
We have this amazing tool of this genetic data, but I think that in some ways the power of genetic data also can raise alarms and make people wary that you can use this genetic data to trace an individual patient, and sometimes they’ve been reported in the news. And you don’t want to have this patient zero who was associated with this entire outbreak of this variant that proves to undermine the entire vaccine. People can imagine these narratives that would backfire and potentially punish them for releasing data.
You understand why people are reluctant to share the data. No one wants to share information that ends up getting someone in trouble or violates someone’s privacy. But the thing is, everyone’s just interpreting how to protect privacy on their own. There’s not really a strong standard right now, and it’s something where more clarity would be really helpful.
TS: That leads nicely into my next question, which is: How do you think we can improve the system to better track variants going forward? How can we overcome these issues?
MN: Some of the ideas that have been floated are creating new databases that would be quasi protected. So there’s different levels of protection for genetic data. GenBank is completely public—anyone can use that data, there are no restrictions. Then you have GISAID, where you can access the data and you can look at the data, but you can’t directly share the data with anyone else. You have to acknowledge the source of the data in the supplementary table. You’re encouraged to work with people who submitted the data.
It’s kind of like this is the homestretch, and if we can just keep a lid on it until we have enough people vaccinated, we could really prevent this variant problem.
But then there’s potentially a need for another database, where people would be more comfortable submitting more potentially private patient metadata that would be restricted to a certain number of people who can interpret the data in a rigorous way and that have bioinformatics tools for visualizing the data so that people who submit it can rapidly interpret it. And we have this design in mind of this perfect ecosystem where people could submit their sequences and their metadata, and visualization tools would help them interpret it in real time, and that would encourage submission of data, and that would also allow people to get a more holistic picture that includes data from lots of groups around the country. That’s something that I think is one of the most realistic ways to move forward.
TS: I know you have yet to publish on this research, but is there anything preliminary you can tell me at this point about the variants circulating in this country? And related, how do you expect this situation to evolve?
MN: We’re really in a race against time with rolling out vaccine and these variants starting to surge. I mean, we know from what we’ve seen in Europe and in other countries, Brazil, South Africa . . . and even some of our homegrown variants in California, in New York, that these variants have the capacity to rapidly take off in populations. And we know that they’re simmering in low levels. . . . We’re sort of [in] the calm before the storm, as bursts of transmission are likely to occur. And how many people we have vaccinated by the time these bursts begin is really the race-against-time question.
But it does emphasize that we’re in this really important inflection period right now, where there’s a lot of motivation to lift restrictions, and open businesses and open restaurants. And doing that right as these variants are transmitting under our nose and creating conditions for new epidemics is, it’s kind of like this is the homestretch, and if we can just keep a lid on it until we have enough people vaccinated, we could really prevent this variant problem.
I think the upcoming months are going to be really interesting to see how the variants play out with this mix of a proportion being vaccinated, variants . . . that we’re already seeing starting to take off in certain places, and lifting of restrictions that facilitates that [spread].
I can tell you from our initial data that the low proportion of variants that we see overall, certainly for some of these variants in certain places, it belies a story where if you look at the genetics, you can see that there are transmission clusters. . . . There’s so much heterogeneity in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So you have this system where it kind of percolates and percolates, and then you have some superspreading and that just facilitates a whole game change in how the epidemic plays out.

AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 Shot Completely Prevented Severe Disease/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MONGKOLCHON AKESIN
Update (March 23): The US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’s Data Safety Monitoring Board “expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” NIAID said in a statement today. AstraZeneca responded in its own statement that the data came from a prespecified interim analysis and that the company “will immediately engage with the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to share our primary analysis with the most up to date efficacy data.”
N
o recipients of Oxford/AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine developed serious symptoms or went to the hospital because of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating the immunization may completely protect against severe disease, according to data from a Phase 3 trial conducted in the US, Chile, and Peru. The two-dose immunization was also 79 percent effective at preventing symptomatic cases, the company announced in a press release today (March 22).
“Seeing this data now I hope gives others increased confidence that this is a very effective and safe vaccine,” Mene Pangalos, an AstraZeneca executive vice president, told reporters at a press conference, according to Reuters. 
The company expects to apply for emergency use authorization in the US in April, Reuters reports. The vaccine is already in use in numerous countries around the globe. 
Concerns about the risk of blood clots resulting from the vaccine led some of those nations to pause distribution this month, but after reassurance from the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency last week that there is no increased risk of thrombosis, many countries have resumed rollout. AstraZeneca reported no elevated risk of blood clots among those who received the shots in its Phase 3 study.
The trial included more than 32,000 participants—two-thirds of whom received the vaccine, while one-third got a placebo—and 141 individuals developed COVID-19 in total. There didn’t appear to be differences in efficacy between racial or age groups.
“And that was the extent of hard data reported in the company’s press release,” MedPage Today notes. “It did not indicate the time frame for dosing and follow-up, stratification of results by sex, nor effectiveness against virus variants of concerns such as B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 (the U.K. and South African strains, respectively).”
The vaccine delivers the gene for SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein using a chimpanzee adenovirus vector. The Washington Post notes that it has the advantage of being stored in a regular refrigerator, rather than in freezers as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines do, and is comparatively cheap at $4 a dose. The other two cost at least $30 for the two-dose regimen.

According to the Post, the US has preordered 300 million doses of AstraZeneca’s shots.
A Global Registry Aims to See if COVID-19 Causes Diabetes/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TEMPURA
T
ype 1 and 2 diabetes are among the pre-existing conditions associated with more-severe COVID-19 and a greater risk of death from the infection. A growing number of reports have also linked coronavirus infections with new cases of diabetes, prompting researchers to investigate the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 triggers the metabolic disease. 
To answer some of the questions about how the two diseases influence each other, researchers from King’s College London and Monash University in Australia established the COVIDIAB registry last year to compile detailed reports of COVID-19–related diabetes. According to The Guardian, about 350 clinicians have submitted reports to date.
“The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes is very complex,” Francesco Rubino, the chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King’s College London and one of the researchers who started the registry, tells Scientific American. “It might involve more than one issue.”
A meta-analysis of more than 3,700 patients, published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism in November, found that 14.4 percent of COVID-19 patients were newly diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
“We clearly see people without previous diabetes developing diabetes,” Remi Rabasa-Lhoret, a metabolic diseases researcher at the Montreal Clinical Research Institute, tells CTV News in a March 15 article. “It is highly probable that COVID-19 is triggering the disease.” 
Although other viral infections such as the flu have previously been implicated in new cases of diabetes, “the magnitude of what we see with COVID-19 is above what we’re used to,” says Rabasa-Lhoret.
One of the many questions that researchers have is whether new-onset diabetes is initiated by COVID-19 or if these patients were already at risk of developing the disease. “It’s possible that [a] patient lives with pre-diabetes for many years and didn’t know that,” Mihail Zilbermint, an endocrinologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, tells CTV News. “Now they have COVID-19 infection, and the infection is pushing them towards developing diabetes.”
There are a few possible ways that COVID-19 could trigger diabetes, which is caused either by insufficient insulin, a hormone that regulates cells’ uptake of sugar, or by a reduced sensitivity to insulin. According to Scientific American, SARS-CoV-2 might attack the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas or other organs and tissues involved in metabolism. Inflammation related to COVID-19 could also influence blood sugar regulation via stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. It’s also possible that steroids commonly used to treat COVID-19 play a role in diabetes development.

Opinion: Preprints in the Public Eye/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JENNY ON THE MOON
T
he COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the growth of preprints. For scientists and health professionals, the pandemic has driven the need to share research findings about COVID-19, however preliminary, as quickly as possible to better understand its pathology, find new therapeutic options, and inform policy. Public demand for information about COVID-19 has driven the increase in media reporting of research posted as preprints. Even before the pandemic, there was a call for scientists to better understand the work of journalists, and the pandemic has made bridging the gap between the scientific and media communities, particularly in relation to communicating scientific uncertainty, an imperative.
Last year, ASAPbio conducted the #bioPreprints2020 questionnaire, an online survey of a wide range of stakeholders, including librarians, researchers, journalists, and funders, to understand perceived benefits and concerns about preprints. ASAPbio (Accelerating Science and Publication in biology) is a scientist-driven nonprofit working to promote innovation and transparency in life sciences communication through the productive use of preprints and open peer review. Not surprisingly, the possibility of premature media coverage of preprints was the top concern for respondents. This was the case for both respondents who had posted research as preprints and those who had not.
The media community faces strong time and competitive pressures that make conducting independent verification and validation of research posted as preprints a challenge.
To address this concern, ASAPbio launched and coordinated the Preprints in the Public Eye project, with support from the Open Society Foundations, in September 2020. As far as ASAPbio is aware, the project was the first step toward bringing together stakeholders from the scientific and media communities to agree on common principles around media reporting of research posted as preprints in order to mitigate the risks of publicizing research that is potentially flawed or too preliminary.
The project involved representatives from preprint servers, publishers, and research institutions (including institutional press offices), along with journal editors, researchers, and journalists. The project is now complete, and the outputs are a series of documents making recommendations for preprint servers on labeling preprints and for institutions and researchers on communicating about research, including with the media. For journalists and science writers there are tips and links to resources intended to aid the discovery of research posted as preprints where the science has undergone some form of assessment, such as by a journal-independent peer-review service.
Preprint servers
As part of the preprints labeling arm of the project, we conducted a user experience investigation to determine whether readers notice the labels that currently exist on preprint servers, whether they can distinguish between a preprint and a peer-reviewed article, and what would make the labels more noticeable and easier to understand. The users were five laypeople, three journalists, three researchers, and one clinician. The findings showed a need for noticeable labeling and clarity about the screening criteria used to determine what is posted on a preprint server.
While the document for preprint servers focuses on transparency about screening criteria and the absence of traditional peer review carried out by the preprint server, there was much discussion among the project stakeholders about the nuances around peer review of preprints. For example, some preprints will have undergone traditional peer review and be published in a journal, some will undergo peer review via journal-independent peer-review services, while others will undergo community review, either via direct commenting on the preprint or by other community-run peer-review or curation activities.
The flawed nature of traditional peer review has been iterated many times, and the rise in the rate of retracted peer reviewed articles challenges the notion that traditional peer review alone is a reliable form of validation. The stakeholder discussions highlighted the need to move beyond attitudes that focus on the presence or absence of traditional peer review toward an approach that encourages a standardized and responsible way of talking about all research for all stakeholders. While this discussion is not directly reflected in the recommendations for preprints, the project stakeholders agreed that the quality of research should not be determined by its peer-review status, but by the level of scrutiny the research has undergone and whether that feedback (which may be from a number of different sources) is positive or critical.
Institutions and researchers
For institutions and researchers, project stakeholders made recommendations around how they should talk about research with the media community. The document for institutions encourages transparency about the level of independent scrutiny and limitations of research, and encourages the provision of guidance and support for researchers on communicating about their work in various forms of media.
One point that was and remains contentious is whether institutions should actively promote to the media research that has been posted as a preprint and has yet to undergo independent scrutiny. There was a strong view from some stakeholders that they should not, and that, in cases where active promotion of information was in the interest of public health or safety, an internal risk assessment should be performed before any such promotion. While this is understandable for medical and biomedical research, promoting research posted as preprints in the media is the norm for some fields and some institutions. We have acknowledged this in the guiding principles document as a point that is still open for debate.
The document for researchers is along similar lines, encouraging researchers to talk about the peer-review status and limitations of their work, avoid overhyping their findings, and work in collaboration with their institutional press offices.
Journalists and science writers
The media community faces strong time and competitive pressures that make conducting independent verification and validation of research posted as preprints a challenge. To address this, the guiding principles aim to make it easier for members of the media to identify research that has been scrutinized. The guidelines expand on the existing document Making Effective Use of Preprints: Tips for Communicators, and include resources that journalists can use to identify preprints that have undergone expert evaluation. In addition, by encouraging scientists, via the guiding principles for researchers, to talk about the limitations of their research, and by encouraging preprint servers to include important information in their labeling, the aim is to make it easier for anyone to understand the level of scrutiny a piece of research has undergone.

Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine on Hold in Some Countries/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ROLAND MAGNUSSON
Update (March 22): After the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization concluded last week that AstraZeneca's vaccine is not associated with an overall increased risk of blood clots, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, at at least seven other European countries have said they will resume immunizations, according to Science. The vaccine remains suspended in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Reuters reported on March 19.
T
he administration of Oxford/AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot has been put on pause in Thailand and at least 10 European countries following reports of a small number of recipients developing blood clots. The World Health Organization and European health authorities are investigating these cases, but they say there’s no evidence that the vaccine is unsafe and urge inoculation campaigns to continue, The Washington Post reports.
“There is currently no indication that vaccination caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects of the vaccine,” reads the European Medicines Agency’s statement. “The vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing.”
Among the approximately 5 million European Union residents who have received Oxford/AstraZeneca’s jab, about 30 have experienced blood clots, four of whom died as a result, BBC reports. Experts point out that blood clots are not uncommon and there’s currently no indication that the immunization is to blame for these events. “Reports of blood clots received so far are not greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the vaccinated population,” Phil Bryan, the vaccines safety lead for the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, tells The BMJ. 
Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia have temporarily paused vaccine rollout, while Italy and Austria have suspended the use of certain batches, according to CNBC. On Friday (March 12), Thailand became the first Asian country to follow suit, halting its plans to kick off immunizations that day, the Post reports.
Meanwhile, the UK, France, Australia, Canada, and Mexico will continue their vaccination campaigns as planned, notes CNBC.
Q&A: Unique Circumstances for Minority Scientists During COVID-19/-/H
iring freezes, cancelled conferences, lab closures, and greater childcare demands during the COVID-19 pandemic have stymied research and stalled scientists’ careers. And underrepresented minority researchers have been hit particularly hard, according to a perspective piece published today (March 10) in Science Translational Medicine. 
The Scientist spoke with Rotonya Carr, a hepatologist and liver disease researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and a coauthor of the article, to learn about the disparities that underrepresented minority scientists experience and the steps that institutions can take to support research programs and retain investigators during the pandemic.
The Scientist: What was the motivation for writing this paper?
Rotonya Carr: The coauthors and I are a group of underrepresented minority researchers who get together on a monthly or bimonthly basis, even pre-COVID, to talk about how things are going with our research programs and to be a support network for one another. We met after the lab shutdowns during the pandemic last spring and realized that we were all experiencing the same challenges with our research programs, and were very worried about the sustainability of our programs amidst the shutdown. . . . Even though we had different types of research programs, we were all experiencing similar concerns. 
We decided to take a constructive approach to ensure that our research programs and the research programs of many colleagues throughout the university could withstand the lab shutdowns. After that, we met with some leaders within the university to talk about what we thought were important steps the university should take to ensure that our research programs would survive, and we decided to write about our ideas and experiences.
TS: How has the pandemic impacted research?
RC: There have been many effects of the pandemic on research broadly, and specifically within academic medical centers. We think about the impact in terms of the actual researchers who are performing the research and also the pipeline of future researchers. There have been impacts on research operations and the resources that we have available to us, and there have been impacts also on our ability as academic researchers to have career advancement. 
Rotonya Carr
PENN MEDICINE
To take a little step back, career development for academic researchers really relies on publications and getting invitations to present your work, applying for grants, and successfully being awarded grants. With research shutdowns, we’re not traveling to conferences to share our work, we’re not able to accrue data so that we can publish, and we’re not able to develop enough data to apply for grants. And all of these have effects not only on our ability to advance within our career and do the science that we all want to do, but it also has greater impact on our ability to help the very people we went into research to help—our patients, in the case of academic medical centers. 
We all learned during the COVID pandemic that science is so critical. Unfortunately, having to move a lot of resources toward the clinical mission—and necessarily so—the research mission really suffered. We were very worried about what we saw happening. Some researchers were at risk of losing their lab programs because they simply could not afford to continue to pay their staff and were not able to either recruit patients for studies or perform studies within their lab, and many researchers ended up having to balance their home and work life because schools were not open. Researchers who have young families really felt the brunt of it, because they had to manage virtual learning environments for their children while figuring out how to continue their work. 
We were also worried about what was happening to our future—which I think is ultimately why we decided we had to talk to the leadership and write this article—because there are trainees and students who were no longer offered positions at academic medical centers across the country because of hiring freezes and concerns about finances. [There is] potentially a whole generation of young people whose careers have been derailed by the pandemic.
See “Scientists Around the Globe Pivot Their Research to SARS-CoV-2”
Finally, one of the things that we saw happening across the country was the COVID-related disparity that we as researchers, particularly underrepresented minority researchers, wanted to take an active role to try to improve . . . . But at the same time, universities hadn’t really figured out a way to credit faculty members for engaging in that type of work, and it ended up being an additional tax, in a way, on especially minority faculty, who tend to do those types of activities but have traditionally gotten little academic credit for [doing] so. 
I thought it was an opportunity to bring to light some of these challenges that we saw happening across the country, and really offer some solutions that we thought could help reduce the loss of future researchers and bolster the research mission at the academic medical centers.
See “Opinion: Grad Students Face Uncertainty During the Pandemic”
TS: I think you touched on this, but why have underrepresented minority researchers been hit harder by the pandemic?
RC: Underrepresented minority researchers at academic medical centers, firstly, we are few, and our lab operations tend to be smaller because as a group we haven’t traditionally been as likely to receive federal funding for our lab operations through the NIH [National Institutes of Health]. We often have less mentorship, and our networks are not as expansive as those of our non-minority colleagues. Although all researchers have been impacted by the shutdowns, underrepresented minority researchers have been even more impacted because of these reasons. 
For example, if an underrepresented minority faculty member has only a small grant and his or her lab or research program is shut down and they’re not able to get data, they don’t have much of a buffer, and the risk of losing that faculty member as a researcher can be quite high. So these are challenges uniquely experienced by underrepresented minority researchers. We wanted to offer some solutions, some concrete solutions, that academic medical centers might be able to employ to particularly address the risks that group of researchers are facing.
TS: What are some of the solutions or recommendations that you discuss in the paper?
RC: We offer constructive solutions for academic medical centers to undertake for all researchers, and we also offer some strategies specifically for underrepresented minority researchers. . . . One of the things that we thought was really urgent was for academic medical centers to innovate around the way that resources are traditionally allocated in a university setting. 
[There is] potentially a whole generation of young people whose careers have been derailed by the pandemic.
Typically, individual researchers—we call them principal investigators—have to figure out a way to fund her or his own research program and those dollars go to that research program. And that strategy, we think, works when there are plenty of resources available. But when resources are scarce, like what we experienced during the pandemic, we really wanted academic centers to think in a new way about how to garner resources to help researchers keep their lab programs open and their research programs open. One of the things that we thought was really important is that universities and academic medical centers develop a bridge fund and work with various leaders across their institution to create a pool of funding that all researchers could access to really bridge them through this pandemic. 
We also wanted to make sure, however, that those funds are equitably allotted to underrepresented minority researchers as well as non-minority researchers, so institutions would have to really take stock of who their underrepresented minority faculty are and develop a database to track how these funds are being allocated equitably. We thought that that was really an urgent thing, and I have to say that our university was successful in implementing such a program, and I was one of many who benefited from that bridge program. 
Another thing I want to highlight that we thought was really critically important and urgent is that academic medical centers end the hiring freeze for students and trainees and junior faculty. These [people] are the most vulnerable among us. They are just starting their careers. If we don’t think critically about how to retain that group of investigators, we potentially could lose a generation of investigators, and there aren’t many underrepresented minority investigators to begin with. 
[Another recommendation is that] academic medical centers really look at their promotion processes and offer researchers either an extension on the promotion clock and/or adapt their promotion criteria to include the things that researchers, especially underrepresented minority researchers, are very likely to be engaged in, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of community outreach, engagement, and advocacy. These are activities that many underrepresented minority researchers and other faculty members are doing at the risk of not being able to develop their own careers, and we think that academic medical centers should really take a look at their processes and incorporate these professional development activities to count for career advancement. This is something, also, that our university has done, and we’re really proud that we were able to contribute to getting our university to make the shift.
TS: Do you think that there’ve been any upsides to the pandemic in terms of highlighting some of these issues that perhaps were around even around before the pandemic?
RC: Yeah, I think one thing that the pandemic has taught all of us, whether you’re in research or not, is that we as large institutions do indeed have the capacity to be innovative and nimble, and we don’t have to be beholden to traditional ways of operation. And that part has been really exciting for me to watch, especially with the vaccine development. Taking some of those lessons that made vaccine development so successful and applying them to our day-to-day research operations, I think, is a very exciting prospect that leaders at academic centers should really look at. 
These are challenges uniquely experienced by underrepresented minority researchers.
One of the things I was really struck by was the coordination between the regulatory bodies that got the vaccines developed as quickly as they were able to do. On the academic medical side, one of the things that we thought would be really helpful is for us to use a similar approach of looking at our own regulatory bodies—and for us it’s the review board for human subjects research as well as animal research—and figuring out ways to increase resources for the board so that we can expedite the speed at which investigators can get their protocols approved, so that when we are one hundred percent back in the lab and back in our research programs, we don’t have additional delays for regulatory processes. I think there’s a lot that we all have learned from the pandemic. I’m looking forward to a new way of doing science more cooperatively, more collaboratively. I hope that we don’t go fully back to the way that we previously conducted science, which tended to be a more siloed approach.
TS: How would you like this paper to be received?
RC: I would love for department heads and university heads to read our paper and adopt some of the ideas that we have. Some of them are quite urgent, especially related to the bridge funding for minority researchers and ending hiring freezes for the most vulnerable among us. I think those are two critical things that need to happen urgently. And there are ways to accommodate these recommendations that are actually still fiscally responsible. I know that’s a big worry of academic medical centers, but we think that now’s the time to invest in research infrastructure, not to shrink it. So that’s the big message that we have. Otherwise, we’re going to lose quite a few researchers, many who are just getting their careers started. So if we had that impact, I think we will feel that our publication has been a success.

Pandemic May “Roll Back” Women’s Gains in STEMM: NASEM Report/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SOLSTOCK
T
he US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report this week (March 9) showing how disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have taken a toll on women’s careers in research. The document, which runs more than 200 pages and includes survey responses from women in science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine (STEMM), identified several areas of concern, including decreases in publishing, challenges with work-life boundaries, and mental health problems.
“The evidence available at the end of 2020 suggests that the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic endangered the engagement, experience, and retention of women in academic STEMM,” reads the report summary, “and may roll back some of the achievement gains made by women in the academy to date.”
Through surveys, the report’s organizers collated hundreds of responses from women in academic STEMM about their experiences last year. They concluded that although women’s representation and influence in STEMM fields have been increasing in the years leading up to 2020, these trends have been hindered as difficulties with remote work and increased caregiving responsibilities have piled up during the pandemic.
See “Gender Gap in Research Output Widens During Pandemic”
An anonymous professor whose survey responses were excerpted in the report wrote: “As a professional engineer working in academia, and single mother of three girls, the pandemic has radically changed everything. . . . I simply do not have the mental bandwidth to be a full time homeschooling mom, housekeeper, instructor, researcher, and family member.”
Another respondent, an associate professor, was quoted in the report as writing: “I am on the verge of a breakdown. I have three children doing virtual school full time who need my attention throughout the day. . . . I try to wake up before them and work after they sleep, but this is hard given they wake up at 7 AM for school and don’t go to bed early.”
The report’s authors determined that some of academic institutions’ efforts to improve the situation may be backfiring, according to Times Higher Education. By providing deadline extensions and work-from-home flexibility, rather than reducing women’s workload to allow them to cope with other demands on their time, employers likely aren’t providing the support women need, and may instead be exacerbating gender inequality by lengthening the time it takes women to advance in their careers.
Eve Higginbotham, the chair of the committee behind the report, tells STAT that the ongoing pandemic could have worse effects on women’s careers in STEMM in the future. “If institutions do not aggressively correct for this, then we will see fewer women being promoted to professor, to leadership positions,” she tells STAT. “It’s just going to look like the 1950s again. So I would say that it would be the gender recession that we’re seeing in corporate America.”
Some Children with COVID-19 or MIS-C Face Kidney Injury: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BEASTFROMEAST
M
ore than 10 percent of children hospitalized with COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome, an inflammatory condition commonly known as MIS-C that in rare cases has followed SARS-CoV-2 infection, experienced acute kidney injury, according to a study published March 3 in Kidney International. Kids with kidney damage remained in the hospital an average of eight days longer than did other children facing these conditions without the added kidney stress.
“Recognizing that kidney function contributes to outcomes post-COVID is important to think about, especially in the pediatric population. These kids are young and have a whole life ahead of them,” says Abby Basalely, a pediatric nephrologist at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, and a coauthor of the study.
People with acute kidney injury can have trouble regulating body fluids or urinating normally. The injury often resolves itself but will sometimes progress into chronic kidney disease, says Isabel Roberti, the director of the Children’s Kidney Center at RWJ Barnabas Health in West Orange, New Jersey.
See “Kids’ Severe COVID-19 Reaction Bears Unique Immune Signature”
There has been much more analysis of how COVID-19 affects adults’ kidneys than of how these organs are affected in children, so Basalely and colleagues wanted to document the incidence of acute kidney injury in kids with COVID-19 or MIS-C along with other short-term health outcomes. MIS-C, which involves fevers, persistent inflammation, and dysfunction in two or more organs including the kidneys, can be a delayed effect of having COVID-19. The researchers performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 152 minors admitted to four hospitals in New York’s Northwell Health System between March and August 2020.
The team defined acute COVID-19 as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within 24 hours of hospital admission. Of the 97 children with acute COVID-19, 8 of them (8.2 percent) also had kidney injury. Another 55 children who did not have acute COVID-19 were diagnosed with MIS-C at hospital admission. Ten of these 55 children (18.2 percent) also had kidney injury. In total, 11.8 percent of the pediatric patients experienced kidney damage.
Black children were almost three times as likely to develop acute kidney injury as others were. Two of the 152 children died, one of whom had acute kidney injury.
Whether COVID-19 or MIS-C is the cause of the kidney damage is unknown, but Basalely suspects it is a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. “There have been reports of [the virus] directly infecting kidney tissue,” Basalely says, though she notes that these reports are provisional and generally have come from adults. Besides a direct infection of kidney tissue, Basalely says, the body’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2 sometimes goes into overdrive and could lead to kidney inflammation.
The authors couldn’t rule out that some children identified with acute kidney injury may have experienced impaired kidney function before arriving at the hospital. Researchers did not have access to information about the kidney function of the children prior to entering the hospital, so their determinations of injuries were based on lab work conducted at admission or during the hospital stay. Half of the children with acute COVID-19 and kidney injury already had both conditions upon admission, as was true for 80 percent of those with MIS-C and kidney injury.
Other institutions do see evidence of kidney injury as soon as kids arrive at the hospital. “It aligns more or less with what we are seeing here in terms of acute kidney injury episodes, particularly with MIS-C,” says Siddharth Shah, the chief of pediatric nephrology at Norton Children’s Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, who was not involved in the study.
Lara Danziger-Isakov, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio, has also treated episodes of acute kidney injury in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C. In her experience, this damage is less likely to be evident at hospital admission than it was in Basalely’s study.
Shah says he is concerned, like Basalely and Roberti are, that experiencing a bout of acute kidney injury could lead to worse problems down the line. Norton Children’s has established clinics to monitor long-term symptoms of children who have had COVID-19 or MIS-C, including signs such as elevated blood pressure or a loss of protein in urine that could indicate increased risk of chronic kidney disease, Shah says.

COVID-19 Vaccine Combos Aim to Boost Immunity/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CGLADE
A
bout a dozen COVID-19 vaccines have been approved around the world, providing a possible path out of the pandemic. But hurdles have emerged, including logistical issues around vaccine rollouts, a rising tide of worrisome variants, and uncertainty around the longevity of immunity. New trials underway to test combinations of different manufacturers’ vaccines seek to overcome some of these challenges.
“It’s really exciting that we have these combination trials,” says Sarah Caddy, a viral immunologist at the University of Cambridge. “If we can use different vaccines, that opens opportunities for vaccinating more people.” In addition, she notes, “there’s some evidence that mixing and matching vaccines could give us better immune responses.” 
Vaccines induce immunity by training the immune system to recognize a piece of SARS-CoV-2 called an antigen—usually the spike protein, which the coronavirus uses to unlock human cells. Most currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines deliver this training via two shots: the prime and the boost. Moderna’s and Pfizer’s versions, the first to receive emergency use authorization in the US, use mRNA to deliver the transcript encoding the virus’s spike protein. Oxford/AstraZeneca’s and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines, which use harmless adenoviruses as vectors to deliver the gene for the protein, have also been approved for use in other countries.
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
But with demand for doses greatly outweighing supply, vaccine rollout has been slow, complicated in part by the requirement for two doses of the same shot. Only two vaccines authorized for use in various countries so far—Johnson & Johnson’s and CanSino Biologics’s adenovirus-based vaccines—are administered as a single injection. A solution to this problem could be to mix-and-match the prime and boost, so recipients could get whatever shot was on hand for their second dose.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines state that different approved vaccines can be combined in “exceptional situations,” but stipulate that they are otherwise not interchangeable due to a dearth of clinical evidence about the safety and efficacy of these combinations. “We have an incredible array of [vaccines] . . . but we don’t know anything about how compatible they are,” says Bruce Gellin, the president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute. “Given that we’re likely to have increasing products out there, it would be good to know how they work when you can’t get the exact regimen that was in the clinical trial.” 
The logic behind combining vaccines
In addition to the practical advantages of being able to switch between vaccines, a combo approach could induce greater immune responses if the two shots use different platforms, says Shan Lu, a physician-scientist and the director of the Laboratory of Nucleic Acid Vaccines at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Scientists call this strategy heterologous prime boosting. “The format of the vaccine is different, but the antigen is the same,” Lu explains. For example, the prime shot could deliver the instructions for cells to make the spike protein via RNA, while the booster could be a viral vector vaccine or one based on a recombinant version of the spike protein, says Lu. No recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccines have yet received widespread approval, but those from US company Novavax and the Russia-based Vector Institute are currently in Phase 3 trials.
A robust immune response involves not only virus-neutralizing antibodies but also helper T cells, which boost antibody production, and cytotoxic T cells, which clear away infected cells. T cells are therefore likely to be important for long-lasting immunity, and two non-peer reviewed studies suggest that they are better than antibodies at thwarting SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro.
Previous studies on other diseases have found that while some vaccine formats are better at inducing antibodies, others do a better job at stimulating T cell production. DNA and mRNA vaccines provoke the body to produce the antigen itself, a process that activates T cells and facilitates the production of antibody-producing B cells, explains Lu. In contrast, “protein vaccines or inactivated vaccines don’t involve T cells very much because the antigen isn’t actually produced inside the body,” he says.
We have an incredible array of [vaccines] . . . but we don’t know anything about how compatible they are.
—Bruce Gellin, Sabin Vaccine Institute
By combining different vaccine formats that rev up different arms of the immune system, “you can get the best of both worlds,” says Wolfgang Leitner, the chief of the innate immunity section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “If you alternate between platforms, it turns out you can get more than the sum of the two. . . . They seem to work synergistically.” But, he adds, “to be honest, we don’t understand the mechanisms yet.”
Although the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are up to 95 percent effective at preventing disease, it’s too early to tell how long-lasting this protection is and how well vaccine-conferred immunity protects against variants that have emerged since the vaccines were designed. “Improving the quality [of vaccines] is not just about the level of efficacy,” says Leitner, “better also means . . . improving the breadth of the immune response.” If combining vaccines induces stronger T cell responses, this approach might have a leg up on variants, says Leitner. But, he adds, “this is all hypothetical because it hasn’t been tested yet.”
See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”
Mix and match
Heterologous prime boosting isn’t new. An Ebola vaccine was recently authorized in the European Union that uses an adenovirus vector carrying the gene for a viral protein, followed by a booster shot of another harmless vector called modified vaccinia virus Ankara that bears the same gene. The Russian Gamaleya Center’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, which is about 92 percent effective at preventing disease, also uses a heterologous prime boost approach. The two shots deliver the same SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene, but the adenovirus vectors, known as rAd26 and rAD5, differ for each shot. Switching up the viral vector can overcome a well-established problem with this type of vaccine whereby the body develops immunity not only to the target gene, but to the vector as well.­­
If you alternate between platforms, it turns out you can get more than the sum of the two.
—Wolfgang Leitner, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Other heterologous prime boost strategies have paired two different vaccine formats. In Lu’s work on HIV vaccines, he and his colleagues found that a prime shot of a circular piece of viral DNA followed by a boost of recombinant protein induced better immune responses than either shot alone or in the reverse order. Phase 3 trials of this vaccine are currently underway.
“The order matters,” says Lu. “We found that DNA first, protein after is better than protein first, DNA after. You cannot reverse that.” DNA vaccines for other diseases, when used alone, have failed to confer strong immunity. This may be because, unlike protein-based or adenovirus vector vaccines, DNA vaccines don’t induce the production of enough antigen to stimulate high antibody titers, a reason why DNA may be better suited as the prime shot.
Yet heterologous prime boost vaccinations for different diseases have occasionally reversed this order. And studies have found other combinations, such as an adenovirus vector with a protein subunit vaccine, can produce promising results. “It is virtually impossible to make predictions of which combination in which order is going to be the best,” says Leitner.
Another strategy is the codelivery of different vaccine formats in the same shot, Lu says. In a study published on March 1 in Emerging Microbes & Infections, he and his colleagues describe a novel COVID-19 vaccine that delivers DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as part of a larger piece of circular DNA called a plasmid, and the recombinant spike protein itself in a single shot. In monkeys, the injection induced strong antibody and T cell responses and completely prevented infection when they were exposed to the coronavirus. Several other DNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are in clinical trials.
COVID-19 combo trials
A handful of COVID-19 combination trials are now in the works. A UK study known as Com-Cov will compare immune responses in participants receiving two Pfizer doses, two Oxford/AstraZeneca doses, or one of each in either sequence. It will also compare dosing schedules with four or 12 weeks between the prime and boost shot.
In December, the Gamaleya Center announced plans to commence combination trials of Sputnik V with Oxford/AstraZeneca’s chimp adenovirus vector vaccine. The Russian institute is also negotiating another combination trial with the Chinese company CanSino, Bloomberg reported in early February.
One challenge with developing heterologous prime boost regimens is figuring out which vaccines to combine and which should be the prime and which the boost. Leitner says that any combination of the licensed COVID-19 vaccines could be beneficial. “My attitude would be that there’s probably no downside to any of the combinations. The worst you can get is an additive effect—that’s not a bad thing. The goal, of course, is a synergistic effect.”

Q&A: “Talk to a Scientist” Webinar Series for Kids/-/ABOVE: Karishma Kaushik
CONNIE ZHAO
F
or almost a year now, children across India have been tuning in to “Talk to a Scientist” every week to learn some science and ask a lot of questions. The outreach program was launched by two biologists, Karishma Kaushik and Snehal Kadam, in the wake of the nationwide lockdown enforced to curb the spread of COVID-19. The interactive weekly webinar is among the first of its kind in India, designed to connect young audiences to scientists.
Kaushik runs a research lab that studies human-relevant infection biology at the University of Pune in India. Kadam, now pursuing a PhD at Hull York Medical School in the UK, was a research assistant in Kaushik’s lab when they launched the project.
The Scientist speaks with Kaushik about how they teamed up to turn adversity into opportunity.
The Scientist: What prompted you to launch “Talk to a Scientist?”
Karishma Kaushik: I have always envisioned that when I have my own research group, it will have an outreach division that will engage with the community around us. Snehal and I had planned to go to schools in Pune and just talk science last summer. But then the pandemic happened and we were all at home. I was determined to find a way to go ahead with my plans.
Webinars became all the rage in academia, and it struck me that I could use the very same platform. It would help us reach children anywhere in the country, all of whom were now stuck at home. With a single text, Snehal was on board with the idea and we planned our very first session, which we advertised on Twitter. We would talk about the novel coronavirus and kids could tune in and ask questions. It was an obvious choice—the virus was literally in the air and on everyone’s minds.
We thought five people will show up. There were seventy-five! At the end of the hour, the kids asked, ‘When is the next session?’ Snehal and I were taken aback. We promised another session the following week. We haven’t missed a week since. On March 30 this year, we’ll host our fifty-second consecutive session.
TS: How did you choose your topics as you went forward?
KK: The first season was somewhat random—[we] covered antibiotic resistance, microbes in food, easily relatable topics aligned to our expertise. Then we started structuring into ten-episode seasons that are built around a theme. The final episode in each season is always a hands-on activity. It’s something that the kids can do at home with very easy-to-get materials that they will have around the home, like newspapers or butter or just water. The first few seasons were all biology but now we have expanded beyond biology to include other STEM fields as well.
TS: Can you take me behind the scenes? Who does what in the lead up to a session?
KK: It all starts with planning the next season. This happens way in advance. We share ideas about themes and episodes in a shared online document. Snehal plays a huge part in bringing the ideas to life. She puts together a list of guest scientists who will drive each session, making sure there are a lot of diverse voices. Increasingly, we also have scientists reach out to us to say that they are interested in being a guest speaker. We’re happy to invite them if they are a good fit for an upcoming season.
When he showed a picture of himself holding the Indian flag with white snow all around, the audience got goosebumps. The kids clamored to know more.
Snehal designs the posters for digital announcements for new sessions. Twitter has been a great ally. Speakers are sent a template as a guide for making slides. If we’re hosting the session, [Snehal and I] make the slides together. The presentation is not very rehearsed; we like to be spontaneous. Sessions start with light banter. We have many regulars who seldom miss sessions. The chat window is where a lot of the action takes place, a lot of back-and-forth interactions.
TS: Was there a speaker or topic that was a particular favorite with the audience?
KK: We had Avinash Sharma, who’s an Indian microbiologist-explorer who went to Antarctica. He stayed at Maitri, which is India’s research station there. When he showed a picture of himself holding the Indian flag with white snow all around, the audience got goosebumps. The kids clamored to know more. They wanted to go to Antarctica and do science for India someday too.
I also remember talking about the skin and the different cells of the skin. In this context, we discussed melanocytes, skin color, and diversity, and how your skin color is simply a cell in your body. In another episode, we talked about administration and leadership in Indian science. That produced one of the most memorable questions: ‘How can I become India’s Principal Scientific Advisor?’
TS: What is the impact you hope to create through this platform?
KK: Through this platform, I get to introduce kids to Indian scientists—role models they can relate to and identify with. They get to learn that all of this science is being done in India. It helps them see and connect with an actual scientist. Today’s scientists don’t look like the ones they typically see illustrated in their textbooks. We are much more diverse now. Also, we are funny, we keep the sessions light, there’s a lot of laughter. It’s very different from the perception of a scientist as serious or stuffy.
TS: You’ve kept going for a year now. What has been your biggest takeaway?
KK: It’s very gratifying that we have come a full circle in this one year. We kicked things off with the novel coronavirus. For our first anniversary session, virologist Gagandeep Kang will talk about vaccines and how the different COVID-19 vaccines work.
But I won’t stop here. I know I want to keep going. We secured funding that will support several future seasons.
Personally, I have learned that the time to build a community initiative is whenever you are ready. Not when somebody recommends it in a career stage, not after you get tenure. You should do it when you think the time is right because it brings an unleashed energy and passion.

Interim Report on Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Scrapped by WHO/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DIEGOGRANDI 
I
n January, an international team of infectious disease experts was tasked by the World Health Organization with traveling to Wuhan, China, in search of the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday (March 4) that WHO has scrapped plans to release an interim report of its findings ahead of the full, official record, despite announcing in mid-February that one would be coming. WHO did not provide a statement regarding why the interim report was dropped.
During the month-long investigation—the first two weeks of which was spent in quarantine—the team members remarked on difficulties regarding transparency. They were denied access to raw data, could only visit approved locations, and were barred from speaking to people in the community, Reuters reports. However, Peter Daszak, a member of the investigation team, tweeted in mid-February that an earlier report of lack of access was untrue. According to the Journal, officials in Beijing have encouraged the team to look outside Wuhan for the origin, as they suspect it arrived in the city in the form of contaminated, imported frozen foods. 
In a March 4 statement, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that the full report and a summary will be released the week of March 15, with member states having access before the release.
At the end of the investigation period in February, Peter Ben Embarek, an expert in zoonotic diseases who co-led the team, cast doubt that the virus was created in or leaked from a lab. The prevailing hypothesis is that the virus came from bats, perhaps through an intermediary host.
Given the level of interference by the Chinese government during the investigation, some experts say a lab-related incident cannot be definitively ruled out. An open letter with around two dozen signatories from several countries was published by the Journal on March 4 addressing the concerns.
“[T]he joint team did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation into all the relevant SARS-CoV-2 origin hypotheses,” the letter reads, “whether natural spillover or laboratory/research-related incident.”
The letter identifies nine limitations of WHO’s investigation and provides a 13-point outline of what the signatories say the standards should have been, including fully exploring all possible scenarios, having full or significant access to locations and data, and conducting confidential interviews with some of the earliest-known COVID-19 patients. 
NIH Halts Outpatient COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Trial/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CHOJA
O
n February 25, the National Institutes of Health halted a clinical trial testing the use of convalescent plasma in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients after an independent advisory board declared the treatment was no better than placebo at preventing severe disease or death.
“Even if enrollment continued, the trial was highly unlikely to demonstrate that convalescent plasma prevents progression from mild to severe disease,” says Simone Glynn, an epidemiologist at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), which led the study. Data underlying the decision to stop the trial are not yet available, Glynn notes, because patients are being followed for up to 30 days after participating in the trial.
The cessation of the trial is the latest blow to an intervention that had been considered promising for preventing progression from mild to severe COVID-19 in people who contract the virus.
The principle behind infusing antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients into sick patients is more than 100 years old. Based on observational evidence that plasma prevented cases of severe COVID-19, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of the therapy for people hospitalized with COVID-19 in August.
Convalescent plasma was a good treatment when we didn’t know how to make virus-specific antibodies. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and it served its purpose.
—Miriam Merad, Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai
Representatives of 47 emergency departments across the US took part in the Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma of Outpatients trial (C3PO), according to NIH, designed to test whether convalescent plasma is beneficial in an outpatient setting. The NHLBI had enrolled 511 of the 900 patients it had aimed to recruit by the time the trial ended.
The study participants were recruited for the trial when they went to emergency rooms after experiencing mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19. All of them had been sick for a week or less and were not admitted to the hospital. Everyone had at least one risk factor, such as obesity or hypertension, for progressing to severe disease. Half of the participants were to receive a single infusion of plasma donated from COVID-19 survivors and the other half a placebo. 
While the monitoring board concluded that convalescent plasma was safe, they found that it was no better than placebo in changing the patients’ outcomes. Following that determination, NHLBI Director Gary Gibbons halted the study.
See “Indian Study Shows No Survival Benefit of Plasma in COVID-19”
Although the data analysis continues, NHLBI officials are confident that the placebo and treatment groups were comparable to each other. “From what we’ve seen so far, all demographics were well balanced,” says Nahed El Kassar, who administered C3PO for the NHLBI.
The debate over convalescent plasma continues
The use of convalescent plasma quickly became politicized during the COVID-19 pandemic, with former President Donald Trump hyping the treatment long before randomized trials to determine its efficacy were conducted. Trump was at former FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn’s side when Hahn announced the EUA for convalescent plasma at a press conference that led to calls for Hahn’s resignation for overstating the treatment’s benefits.
Against that fractious backdrop, several clinical trials have taken place around the world, some previously covered by The Scientist. They collectively appear to dampen hopes about the benefits of convalescent plasma, particularly in hospitalized patients. NIH’s decision to halt C3PO comes less than a week after a JAMA review of 10 clinical trials also found that plasma was no better than placebo at reducing death or improving clinical outcomes. Nine of these trials focused on hospitalized patients, the other looked at outpatients.
“Convalescent plasma was a good treatment when we didn’t know how to make virus-specific antibodies. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and it served its purpose. But right now, I think it’s the end [of convalescent plasma as a viable treatment], and I’m not surprised by the [NIH] results at all,” says Miriam Merad, an oncologist and immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai.
See “Two COVID-19 Clinical Trials Seek to Enroll Pregnant Women”
Some physicians, such as Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic, maintain that convalescent plasma can be helpful for certain patients. Joyner was one of the leaders of the expanded access program for convalescent plasma in the US last year, which led the FDA to issue the EUA that ratified convalescent plasma’s use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. He argues that emerging evidence shows a benefit of convalescent plasma if offered early in a hospital stay, at doses higher than those the NIH tested.
“I’m very comfortable saying if you have lymphoma, leukemia, some sort of inborn problem or are taking an immunosuppressant, that convalescent plasma is fantastic,” Joyner says. “I’m also very happy to tell people that if they’re symptomatic as outpatients, go get monoclonals,” Joyner adds. Monoclonal antibodies are tailored to attack the spike proteins of the virus that grab hold of receptors on human cells and initiate infection. Two monoclonal drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly have received EUA from the FDA.
Merad says that monoclonal antibodies are superior to convalescent plasma because they are purpose-built to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Convalescent plasma probably does contain some neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, she says, but also will contain antibodies to other infections that have nothing to do with the virus. If the trouble is antibody production, she says, use the tool that’s best equipped to solve that challenge. Merad also notes that there is always a risk of contamination when a blood product is transfused from one person to another.
The debate over the use of convalescent plasma seems likely to continue as clinical trials proceed. NIH is sponsoring a study of the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and Johns Hopkins University is sponsoring two trials of its use in outpatient settings.
Kids May Suffer from Long COVID, but Data Are Scarce/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GEBER86

hile kids who contract SARS-CoV-2 generally don’t get severe COVID-19, evidence is accumulating that some may suffer long-lasting effects akin to what’s been dubbed long COVID in adults. Healthcare centers around the world are setting up facilities to monitor and deal with the problem, including among children.
Data from the UK Office for National Statistics released in February showed that 13 percent of COVID-19 patients under the age of 11 and about 15 percent of those aged 12 to 16 had at least one symptom more than a month after diagnosis. And in a preprint posted on medRxiv at the end of January, researchers surveying caregivers of 129 patients under the age of 18 in Rome found that more than half of the children had yet to completely recover within four months of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and nearly one-quarter of the children had three or more symptoms that persisted for at least that long.
In both cases, the long-term challenges aren’t limited to those hit hard by the infection initially, the researchers found; even some children who didn’t feel sick when they first tested positive described symptoms months later.
See “Kids’ Severe COVID-19 Reaction Bears Unique Immune Signature”
These data lack control groups, making it hard to assess whether symptoms such as fatigue and nasal congestion are truly related to the children’s SARS-CoV-2 infection. But it’s still important work, Lara Danziger-Isakov, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, tells Medscape Medical News about the medRxiv study. “It’s waving a flag to say we need to pay attention to this and do more investigation.”
That’s exactly what investigators are doing now. Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore’s Danilo Buonsenso, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Gemelli University Hospital and the lead author on the medRxiv preprint, and his colleagues are now gathering data on more young patients. And Terence Stephenson, a professor of child health at University College London, was recently awarded £1.36 million (nearly US $2 million) to study long COVID in patients aged 11 to 17 years, he tells The Guardian. “I don’t have a scientific view on what long Covid is in young people . . . because frankly, we don’t know.”
See “Could COVID-19 Trigger Chronic Disease in Some People?”
In the meantime, healthcare centers such as Norton Children’s Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, and the Children’s Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, are setting up clinics to monitor minors who’ve been diagnosed with COVID-19, Kaiser Health News (KHN) reports. “The question I can never answer for the parents is why one child and not another?” Jean Ballweg, a pediatric cardiologist at Children’s Hospital & Medical Center, tells KHN. “Hopefully, we can look at the collective experience and recognize patterns and provide better care.”
Q&A: A Molecular Toolkit to Build SARS-CoV-2 Research Capacity/-/ABOVE: Two of the study's authors, Sam Wilson and Suzanah Rihn
STUART CAMPBELL, PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW
W
hen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Sam Wilson and his colleagues quickly realized that they lacked the fundamental tools to study the disease-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2. “That’s when we started to produce these research tools,” including antibodies and a system for modifying the virus, says Wilson, a molecular virologist at the MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. At the same time, Wilson noticed many non-coronavirus labs were pivoting their research to focus on COVID-19. “We were producing reagents for ourselves, so it seemed sensible to produce them for the wider research community as well,” he says. 
In a paper published February 25 in PLOS Biology, Wilson and his collaborators describe a molecular toolkit for SARS-CoV-2 research, including viral isolates, a reverse genetics system for genetically manipulating the virus, and a suite of antibodies that target almost all its proteins. “The publication has just come out, but actually the tools that are described have been available to the scientific community as soon as they were produced,” says Wilson. The resources described in the paper are available for purchase on their nonprofit website. 
The Scientist speaks with Wilson to learn more about how these tools could help advance research on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, immunity to viral “scariants,” and COVID-19 treatments.
The Scientist: Tell me a little bit about the tools in this kit.
Sam Wilson: There are a lot of tools, but there are really two main tools that are the most useful features of the toolkit. The first one of those is the newly comprehensive panel of antibodies to proteins in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The second most important tool is the very easy to use reverse genetics system, which is a simple way that we can genetically modify the SARS-CoV-2 virus to conduct experiments.
TS: What kind of research are you hoping to facilitate with the reverse genetics system?
When you produce tools, in a way you send them out into the world and they’re going to take on a life of their own.
SW: It’s important to point out that when you produce tools, in a way you send them out into the world and they’re going to take on a life of their own. So in some ways, it’s limited by the imaginations of the investigators and legal restraints that are placed upon genetic modification of viruses. There are a number of simple and predictable things that these systems can be used for. One of the things we’ve done, for example, is take fluorescent proteins and put those into viruses so that they can be followed in real-time in infection experiments. For the day-to-day job of a molecular virologist, this takes an experiment that can take hours and it means you can do it in real-time with no additional labor. 
The world is obsessed with the emerging coronavirus variants of concern or ‘scariants’ as I’ve heard them called on social media. You can take a variant of concern out of a person and culture it in the laboratory and you can study it. It’s very hard to know which individual change is conferring the different phenotypes or different behaviors that you’re monitoring in the lab. So if we take the Kent variant [B.1.1.7], one of the first famous variants to emerge, there’s about 17 major coding changes in the virus—over half of those are not in the spike gene. It’s very easy to study the spike gene in isolation because you can decorate another virus with the spike and study its properties. But if you think of that as the outer shell, if you lift up the bonnet, there’s a lot of other proteins contributing to how the virus behaves and you need to be able to modify those to really work out what contribution they’re having to how the virus behaves. 
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
TS: What about the antibody panel you describe in the paper. How do you see those being used?
There are a number of reverse genetics systems that are available for coronaviruses, but we’ve tried to create a system that can be used by labs that are not coronavirus labs.
SW: People are going to come up with really good ideas of what these antibodies can be used for that are going to be part of much bigger studies, to validate how they’re doing experiments. I think they’re going to have a really big role in lots of things in the scientific community. But if we think of specific things that antibodies tend to be used for in the laboratory, I can think of two main uses. We might take a step back and remember what antibodies are: they’re a way that animals have to very specifically recognize a component of an invading pathogen. . . . And we can use that by making antibodies in animals to all the virus components and then we can use those antibodies to pull a virus protein out of an infected cell and see what that viral protein is stuck to. That can tell us a lot about how that virus protein functions and it can also identify interfaces between host and pathogen. And these are very often druggable, so by learning about these interfaces it can give you new ideas for therapeutic interventions. 
The other thing that people do very commonly is use antibodies to find out where the virus is—say, in an infected tissue, or you can use the antibodies to find out where exactly in a cell this viral protein is. And again, that can help you understand what that viral protein does.
TS: In the paper, you mention that part of the reason for developing these tools was to facilitate research in labs that maybe hadn’t worked on coronaviruses in the past. Can you tell me about that?
SW: I think now there’s a huge number of labs around the world working on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. But at the beginning [of the pandemic] there was a real hunger for bespoke reagents—there are certain scientific tools that need to be tailored towards the virus. If you think about the reverse genetic tools and the antibodies, both of those can help research in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. There are a number of reverse genetics systems that are available for coronaviruses, but we’ve tried to create a system that can be used by labs that are not coronavirus labs—molecular virology labs but with no prior coronavirus expertise. It’s a very stable and simple genetic system that you can recover virus from what scientists would call a miniprep, a very simple way of preparing DNA. So there’s no complicated upstream steps before, what we call, the rescue of infectious virus.
TS: Have you seen a lot of labs moving towards coronavirus research during the pandemic? How has this helped push forward research on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
SW: I think it’s both amazing and a tremendous risk. I think that probably at no time in human history has there been such a universal move around the world in science to focus one specific global problem. So that’s meant that the pace of research has been faster than I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve never seen so much collaboration, so many preprints, and the sharing of research data before publication. I’ve heard the term ‘covidization’ of global research, which is used to describe that. And obviously there’s a risk to that as well—all the research that people were doing before that was presumably very important [has halted]. Just as hospitals have suffered as they’ve moved over to treating COVID-19 because patients are no longer being treated for other illnesses, it’s the same for research—there’s been a huge investment of time and effort in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research, which has been amazing, but I wonder what we’ve lost in place of that.
See “Scientists Around the Globe Pivot their Research to SARS-CoV-2”
TS: What do you see as the big research questions around COVID-19 that still remain?
Another big question mark that is probably the most important one facing humanity right now is, just how long and how robust is immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from the vaccines that are currently being used?
SW: There are many, many big questions. So I’m going to answer that from a very personal point of view. My research interests are in cross-species transmission and the emergence of viruses. I’m very interested in the events that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. At the moment there is still some debate as to the exact bat that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from and whether there were intermediate species involved in cross-species transmission to humans. I think that’s really important if we’re to understand how this might happen again. 
I think that another big question mark that is probably the most important one facing humanity right now is, just how long and how robust is immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from the vaccines that are currently being used? Are we going to have to move to a model where we repeatedly vaccinate people to create lifelong sterilizing immunity with a vaccine to SARS-CoV-2? I think that’s quite an open question.
See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”
TS: What is the current understanding around the emergence of SARS-CoV-2?
I think that probably at no time in human history has there been such a universal move around the world in science to focus one specific global problem.
SW: If we look in bats, specifically horseshoe bats, Rhinolophidae, you can find very closely related viruses to SARS-CoV-2. So we assume that there is a bat species or multiple species that are harboring viruses that are very closely related to SASR-CoV-2. What are the specific circumstances that favor cross-species transmission to humans, perhaps through an intermediate species? Was it happening before but not taking off for some reason? Or was there a specific event that led to this virus emergence? I think that these are the questions that a lot of people are looking into now, and there’ll be a lot of sampling required.
See “Are Climate-Driven Shifts in Bat Diversity to Blame for COVID-19?”
TS: How do you hope this study is received by the research community?
SW: I think this is quite different from most science in that it’s not a discovery piece. . . . I think when you produce reagents like these, the main hope is that somebody, somewhere will use them to do something either useful or very interesting. And then I think that our job will have been done.

Frontiers Removes Controversial Ivermectin Paper Pre-Publication/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 
BEIJINGSTORY
T
he editors of Frontiers in Pharmacology have taken down an article about the use of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin in COVID-19 patients. The paper, which was written by members of an organization called the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), had been provisionally accepted and posted in abstract form by the journal in January, but was ultimately rejected this Monday (March 1). The editors determined that it contained unsubstantiated claims and violated the journal’s editorial policies.
By the end of last week, the abstract had been viewed more than 85,000 times, according to snapshots available on the internet archive.
The paper’s removal has drawn anger from members of the FLCCC and its followers. In comments on Twitter and in an interview with The Scientist, the organization’s president, Pierre Kory, describes the move as “censorship.” He adds in the interview that the paper had already successfully passed through multiple rounds of review. In reversing the paper’s acceptance, the journal is “allowing some sort of external peer reviewer to comment on our paper,” he says. “I find that very abnormal.”
Ivermectin is widely used in tropical medicine to treat parasitic infections, but its use as a COVID-19 drug has been controversial since the beginning of the pandemic, with major health organizations consistently stating that there is insufficient evidence for its efficacy in prevention or treatment of the disease.
See “Surgisphere Sows Confusion About Another Unproven COVID-19 Drug”
The FLCCC’s paper (also posted on the organization’s website) reviewed epidemiological and clinical evidence on ivermectin’s use in people infected with and exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In it, the authors argued that health agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should update their recommendations to include the drug.
Frontiers takes no position on the efficacy of ivermectin as a treatment of patients with COVID-19, however, we do take a very firm stance against unbalanced or unsupported scientific conclusions.
—Frederick Fenter, Frontiers
After being contacted by The Scientist, the journal posted a statement from Frontiers’s chief executive editor, Frederick Fenter, saying that “Frontiers takes no position on the efficacy of ivermectin as a treatment of patients with COVID-19, however, we do take a very firm stance against unbalanced or unsupported scientific conclusions.”
During review of the article in what the journal refers to as “the provisional acceptance phase,” Fenter says in the statement, members of Frontiers’s research integrity team identified “a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance, and at times, without the use of control groups.”
The statement continues: “Further, the authors promoted their own specific ivermectin-based treatment which is inappropriate for a review article and against our editorial policies. In our view, this paper does not offer an objective nor balanced scientific contribution to the evaluation of ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19.”
The statement provided no information about why these concerns had been raised and acted on now, rather than earlier in the publication process.
This isn’t the first time that Kory and his colleagues at FLCCC have been accused of making unsubstantiated claims about ivermectin. In December, Kory gave a statement at a US Senate hearing on COVID-19 treatments in which he called ivermectin “effectively a ‘miracle drug’” that could obliterate disease transmission and prevent illness—claims that Associated Press fact-checkers labelled “False” at the time. Kory, who formerly oversaw critical care at the UW Health in Wisconsin, tells The Scientist that he now regrets using “miracle” and other hyperbolic terminology.
Later in December, FLCCC founder Paul Marik, the first author on the now-rejected Frontiers manuscript and a professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School, wrote a paper reviewing ivermectin that included references to debunked papers, including an observational study of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients led by now-discredited Surgisphere Corporation. That study, which had been posted on the preprint server SSRN, was taken down at the request of one of the authors back in May after concerns were raised about the provenance of the company’s data.
There have been a number of trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients, although they haven’t met all the criteria that scientists typically deem necessary to generate strong evidence—that is, being randomized, well-controlled trials with hundreds or thousands of patients and findings published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The NIH, which last updated its advice on ivermectin in COVID-19 patients on February 11, 2021, states that most of the studies claiming to show benefits of ivermectin contain “incomplete information and significant methodological limitations, which make it difficult to exclude common causes of bias.”
The agency concludes that “there are insufficient data . . . to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19,” and calls for “adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials.”
Kory argues that these common criticisms ignore the fact that there are several groups of researchers in favor of ivermectin’s use, and that the urgency of the situation means that health organizations should be looking at smaller, uncontrolled trials and observational data as well as gold-standard trials. He adds that larger trials of the drug are underway or planned. The multicenter TOGETHER trial led by researchers at McMaster University, for example, was announced earlier this year.
Responding to the Frontiers statement’s invitation to the authors to submit a revised version of the paper, Kory says that while he would have been open to removing mentions of his own team’s treatment protocol, he doesn’t want to work with the journal again. “There was no communication with us, no telling us of their concerns, no discussion” during this process, he says. “The idea that I would resubmit to that journal is fairly preposterous, don’t you think?”
Variant Found in Brazil Could Evade Immunity from Past Infection/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HARVEPINO

ccording to a study uploaded to GitHub on February 27 that has not been peer reviewed, an emerging variant of SARS-CoV-2 first spotted in November in Manaus, Brazil and known as P.1 is around twice as transmissible as the variant that gripped the country last spring. Manaus experienced another surge of cases in December, and the study’s model predicts that P.1 could evade antibodies from previous infections 25–61 percent of the time, perhaps pointing to reinfections as a driver of the recent COVID-19 wave.
See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”
The Guardian reports that many of the mutations that affect the variant’s spike protein are the same as those found in the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. The study's authors write that three of the mutations allow the virus to more easily bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells. ACE2 is a surface protein on cells in many tissues, including the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. When the virus binds to that protein, it opens up the cell to infection.
P.1 is not isolated to Brazil and has been identified in six cases from five US states, another six individuals in the UK, and in 23 other countries, The New York Times reports. It is not yet known how these variants will affect outbreaks in these countries, and not all experts are sounding alarms quite yet. 
“You need many introductions [of a virus] to start an epidemic,” coauthor Ester Sabino of the University of São Paulo tells BBC. “Six is very few. I would say if you take care and do contact tracing, this is going to decrease.”
Through genomic modeling, Sabino and her colleagues were able to find that P.1 emerged in Manaus in November and December and stayed within the region through the end of the year. Epidemiological modeling and sample viral loads from patients indicate that the variant is more transmissible than the variant that gripped much of the world in 2020 and could be linked to worse outcomes and an increased likelihood of surpassing immunity from a past SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the models were built around COVID-19 in Manaus, the authors say this is a variant of concern wherever there are active cases of P.1.
As vaccine rollouts surge around the globe and cases and hospitalizations drop accordingly, there could be a chance to drastically reduce infections before another variant has a chance to take hold. The two vaccines approved for use in Brazil are Oxford/AstraZeneca’s, which is 60–90 percent effective at staving off serious illness, and Sinovac’s from China, which is 50 percent effective in Brazil. There has not been any clinical research yet on how the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson shots—the three vaccines approved for use in the US—will fare when faced with P.1. 
“Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we’re working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil,” UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who was not part of the study, tells BBC. “We’re doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we’ve made as a nation.”
Regeneron Cocktail Stumbles Against SARS-CoV-2 Variant in Vitro/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CIPHOTOS
A
COVID-19 treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that consists of a pair of monoclonal antibodies sometimes fails to bind to antigens produced by the concerning B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2, according to a preprint posted February 19 to bioRxiv.
In lab experiments, the researchers found that nine times fewer antibodies within the cocktail bind to B.1.351’s antigens than to antigens from the most common circulating version of the virus. This means that a treatment for B.1.351 would need to be nine times as large to yield the same level of viral neutralization.
“It certainly raises a concern,” says Nathaniel (Ned) Landau, a microbiologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine and the lead author of the study. “When the titer goes down ninefold, it could make it not work as well.” Given that his study was conducted in vitro, Landau notes that the only way to know this for sure is to determine the clinical effects of the cocktail on patients infected with the B.1.351 variant, which first emerged in South Africa.
“One could treat patients with 9-fold more antibody, but it becomes too expensive and very unhealthy to inject such a large amount of a protein,” Landau adds in a follow-up email.
Regeneron’s drug is a one-time infusion of a combination of the antibodies REGN10987 (casirivimab) and REGN10933 (imdevimab). It received emergency use authorization (EUA) in November 2020 for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of progression to severe disease. In the clinical trial that supported the EUA, which included 799 patients, 3 percent of those who received the infusion ended up in the hospital, compared to 9 percent of patients on a placebo.
If one antibody in a two-antibody cocktail can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, then the overall effect will be neutralization, although with less potency.
—Pamela Bjorkman, Caltech 
On February 25, Regeneron halted the placebo arm of its outpatient trial of the cocktail’s effectiveness after an independent review committee’s declaration that the intervention protects well against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The company’s announcement did not include specific details about B.1.351. The trial is taking place in the United States, where B.1.351 has not been widely detected.
The treatment is based on earlier forms of SARS-CoV-2, and new variants raise the question of how effective the cocktail will continue to be. Landau and colleagues tested how well the Regeneron antibodies, either separately or in combination, controlled the infectiousness of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.
They developed artificial viruses containing the spike proteins, the projections on the outside of the virus that grab hold of cells’ receptors to initiate infection, of five different variants, including B.1.351 and the benchmark variant D614G, one of the first mutations to emerge in the pandemic that quickly dominated. In cell culture, they exposed the viruses to the same antibodies as those included in the Regeneron cocktail, and measured the antibody serum concentration needed to reduce viral activity by 50 percent.
REGN10987 held its own against all variants, although with somewhat less success against B.1.351’s spike. Its companion REGN10933 had a much harder time neutralizing this variant, requiring a serum concentration 76 times higher than it needed to neutralize D614G. In tandem, the two were nine times less effective as they were against D614G.
“If one antibody in a two-antibody cocktail can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, then the overall effect will be neutralization, although with less potency,” Pamela Bjorkman, a structural biologist at Caltech who was not involved in either study, writes in an email to The Scientist.
Landau and colleagues attribute REGN10933’s drop in effectiveness to two different point mutations in the spike protein that could help the virus evade the antibody, namely K417N and E484K.
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
The results are supported by Bjorkman’s work. Her group used 3-D models to categorize the results of different antibody/spike protein combinations. In a study published last fall in Nature, she and her colleagues predicted that SARS-CoV-2 variants with point mutations such as those in B.1.351 would successfully evade antibodies like REGN10933—just as Landau’s team observed in the lab.
In an email to The Scientist, Regeneron spokesperson Alexandra Bowie says, “The values reported in this paper seem inconsistent with other results seen to date, both from Regeneron’s internal data and publications from outside researchers.”
The study Bowie cites does find that the antibodies within the Regeneron cocktail bind to B.1.351’s antigens with sufficient potency to reduce its viral activity by 50 percent. Its authors report that one part of the two-part cocktail maintained its capacity to neutralize B.1.351’s antigens, while the other did not. Landau’s team reached a similar conclusion about the potency of the different parts of the cocktail, and says that the cocktail does offer some protection against B.1.351, but not as much as against other variants. So there is not much disagreement between the two studies.
Adapting treatments as the pandemic wears on will be critical, and Bowie says Regeneron is aware of the risks of emerging variants and that the company has more antibodies on deck. “There’s never an antibody that just protects against everything,” Landau says. But over time it is possible, he adds, to “make it harder and harder for the virus to find a way out.”
US Authorizes a Third COVID-19 Vaccine/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JHVEPHOTO
O
n Saturday (February 27), the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine, the third to receive such approval in the US, and the first to require just a single injection.
According to the Associated Press, 4 million doses of the vaccine are expected to reach states by tomorrow (March 2). Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver a total of 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by the end of June. 
The authorization comes after the company announced Phase 3 trials results showing that the vaccine is about 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and 85 percent effective at preventing severe disease at 28 days after vaccination. 
Although Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is less effective than Moderna’s and Pfizer’s versions were in clinical trials, experts emphasize that it still provides strong protection against COVID-19. 
See “One-Shot COVID-19 Vaccine Prevents Severe Disease”
“Don’t get caught up, necessarily, on the number game, because it’s a really good vaccine, and what we need is as many good vaccines as possible,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, tells The New York Times.
The vaccine requires only a single dose and is stable at refrigerator temperatures, two features that could simplify its rollout compared to Moderna’s and Pfizer’s two-dose versions that require subzero storage. Unlike the mRNA-based vaccines that preceded it in authorization, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine uses a weakened version of an adenovirus that carries a piece of SARS-CoV-2’s genetic code.
See “Vector-Based Vaccines Come to the Fore in the COVID-19 Pandemic”
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is currently approved for people aged over 18 years, and the company will soon begin trials in children between 12 and 18 years old, according to The New York Times. Future trials will also include younger children, newborns, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people, the Times reports.

hen the world faced the devastating viral scourge of HIV more than two decades ago, science saved the day. Or so it seemed to some. 
Cases of disease associated with HIV infection started popping up in the US by the early 1980s, and by the late 1990s HIV/AIDS had claimed more than 400,000 lives in the country. Then, with the dawn of a new millennium approaching, drug makers won a flurry of approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that would transform the fight against HIV/AIDS. As ARVs became widely available as part of drug cocktails, the overall death rate from HIV/AIDS plummeted. In the US and elsewhere, the pharmaceutical breakthrough transformed the disease from a death sentence into a manageable infection. But that was only half the story.
In Africa, the epidemic continued to rage, and in 2000, AIDS became the number one cause of death on that continent. In the first half of that decade, millions of people died from the viral disease every year in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Although the research enterprise had arrived at a solution to pull humanity from the grip of the global epidemic, economics had prevented ARVs from penetrating African countries and other areas of the developing world. While ARVs were becoming the go-to HIV treatment in the West, countless Africans died simply because they could not afford the fruits of this particular scientific innovation. Where science triumphed, economics and philanthropy failed.
Some African countries, such as South Africa, where the epidemic was still exacting a terrible human toll, took measures to make the new, saving drugs more accessible to their citizens—by fighting against patent protections, for example. Globally, activists lobbied Western countries to address the ongoing crisis in Africa and other parts of the developing world.

Finally, in 2003, President George W. Bush officially launched the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is overseen by the Global AIDS Coordinator at the US Department of State. By most accounts PEPFAR has saved millions of lives in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond since its inception. 
I am hopeful that, in the context of vaccinating people against COVID-19, the global community will not replay this profoundly regrettable lapse in perspective, which allowed millions to languish in Africa for years while citizens of Western countries enjoyed the benefits of scientific innovation. Some activists in Africa, not to mention in communities of color within the borders of the US, are already sounding alarm bells that COVID-19 vaccination rates in developing nations and in underrepresented populations are lagging behind. Across many US states, Black and Hispanic people are under-vaccinated even though the disease is affecting those communities disproportionately. For example, according to an analysis published last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Hispanic people living in Oregon represent 13 percent of the state’s population, make up 35 percent of COVID-19 cases, and account for 13 percent of the state’s COVID-19 deaths. Despite this, Hispanics account for only 6 percent of Oregon’s COVID-19 vaccinations. And in Africa, vaccinations appear to be similarly lagging behind. According to Our World in Data, a nonprofit statistics website operated by Oxford University’s Global Change Data Lab, only 0.2 percent of people in Africa had received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of February 21, compared with more than 27 percent of people in the UK and more than 19 percent of people in the US.
There are signs of hope that the global community might be acting to close these gaps. In June of last year, before a single COVID-19 vaccine was approved, the Gavi Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) launched the Gavi Advance Market Commitment for COVID-19 Vaccines (Gavi Covax AMC), which aimed to create incentives to motivate vaccine manufacturers to make sufficient quantities of immunizations to ensure access for developing countries. With the approval and deployment of several COVID-19 vaccines, and more likely soon to come, this effort has grown into COVAX, a joint project of Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) that aims to help distribute 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of this year.
That there are organizations focused on the equitable and accessible distribution of the scientific innovation that may tame this global pandemic is hopeful. Although the inequities that exist in public health in the US and beyond have been exacerbated by this once-in-a-generation challenge, it appears that humanity may have learned something from the shameful episode that saw some citizens of Earth suffer from HIV/AIDS while others enjoyed the fruits of the biomedical enterprise. It is my sincere wish that we, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are able to see past national borders, color lines, and socioeconomic disparities. Seeing the solution to the pandemic in this broad view is the only way to effectively address the infectious foe that has disrupted all of our lives.

Q&A: New Trials Tackle COVID-19 Vaccines in Pregnancy/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MJPS
C
OVID-19 vaccination could potentially offer significant benefits to pregnant women, who are at an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19, and to their unborn babies, who are more likely to suffer adverse outcomes than are babies who weren’t exposed to the virus in utero. There has been uncertainty around the risks and benefits of vaccinating pregnant women for COVID-19 because they were excluded from the initial clinical trials for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines currently available under emergency use authorization in the US.
See “COVID-19 Vaccines for Pregnant Moms May Protect Newborns”
Clinical trials are now getting underway to address COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in pregnant women. Last week (February 18), Pfizer and BioNTech announced a global Phase 2/3 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine in 4,000 healthy pregnant women. The placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study will track the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two doses of vaccine 21 days apart, compared to placebo, for 7 to 10 months. The trial will also assess safety in infants of vaccinated mothers and the transfer of antibodies from mother to child for up to six months after birth.
As that trial gets off the ground, Duke University School of Medicine maternal-fetal medicine specialist Geeta Swamy is starting an observational study of COVID-19 vaccination. She and her colleagues will follow about 350 pregnant women, collecting data on any symptoms following vaccination, as well as antibody levels in the mother and in the newborn’s umbilical cord blood. The study will be open to pregnant women who receive any COVID-19 vaccine, rather than limited to a single manufacturer.
Swamy is also a coinvestigator for an ongoing Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 3 vaccine trial that does not include pregnant women and is a member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) but does not participate in committee decisions for COVID-19 vaccines due to her work on the trials. She spoke with The Scientist about finally launching studies in pregnant women, an effort she says manufacturers ideally should have started months ago.
The Scientist: Why is it important to study maternal immunity and COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women?
Geeta Swamy
DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
Geeta Swamy: We know that pregnant women are at increased risk of complications related to COVID infection, particularly with regards to increased risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and other related complications. So, it’s important to figure out not only why the infection is causing these problems, but also what we can do to prevent that and make sure we’re doing everything possible to ensure maternal health, as well as the health of the infant. And vaccines are one of the ways to do that.
TS: What is the design and goal of the COVID-19 vaccination observational study that you’re planning?
GS: At this point, given that we have had this permissive allowance of vaccinations under the emergency use authorization from the FDA, we know that actually thousands of women have gotten vaccinated already and will likely continue to get vaccinated outside of a clinical trial. What we’d like to do is collect data regarding not only the immediate safety profile with regards to side effects like fever, fatigue, and so forth, but also the impact on the overall pregnancy, such as what we consider adverse pregnancy outcomes like preterm birth and low birth weight in the infant. [We also plan to study] the immune response, meaning, how does the vaccine perform in pregnant women? Do the antibody profiles look similar to those seen in nonpregnant people as demonstrated in the clinical trials? And is there also a potential benefit to the newborn infant by transmission of maternal antibodies across the placenta?
TS: What were the obstacles to running trials in pregnant women earlier, as this is happening well after the main trials have started?
We now know somewhere upwards of 20,000-plus women who are pregnant have gotten vaccinated.
GS: In order to do clinical trials in pregnancy, our regulatory pathway . . . in the US has been that we, in addition to human studies in nonpregnant people, need information and data on how the vaccine performed in, say, a pregnant animal model, like in mice or rats or that sort of thing. Those studies have to be done before the FDA will allow an investigational product to be studied in pregnant women. So one barrier is that it takes time to get those things accomplished early on, especially in the setting of a pandemic when people are extremely focused on the first issue of finding an effective vaccine.
The other aspect, though, is that there often is significant hesitancy to enroll or to conduct investigational studies in pregnant women. A lot of that stems from the historical designation of pregnant women being a vulnerable population, with vulnerable being defined as somehow not able to make decisions for themselves or at risk for being coerced, when in actuality they are certainly a special population [with] other risks to consider, but should not be relegated to the end of the line for evaluating what needs to be done in research. Alternatively, we’re left with trying to use expert opinion instead of having done it through the controlled research setting where we could have minimized the number of people potentially exposed and get data in a more timely manner.
See “Two COVID-19 Clinical Trials Seek to Enroll Pregnant Women”
TS: As you know, Pfizer and BioNTech are launching a placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study of their vaccine in 4,000 pregnant women. How is that study different from what you’re planning?
GS: The Pfizer study is planned to follow other similar trials [with] a placebo control, which means that a portion of participants get the vaccine and portion get a placebo like a saline injection. That is really a good model to follow, to have a clear comparison group to see what happens in those who get the vaccine and those who don’t. Unfortunately, it does still raise some ethical concerns at this point, given that we know pregnant women are at increased risk, as we discussed previously, from complications from COVID, and that . . . we now know somewhere upwards of 20,000-plus women who are pregnant have gotten vaccinated. It becomes a question that pregnant women want to choose to get the vaccine. Would they really want to enroll in a trial to get a placebo, weighing those risks and benefits? It isn’t in any way that it would be wrong to do a placebo-controlled trial. It may just not be that people are willing to choose that as an option. The observational study is basically anyone who is getting vaccinated per CDC guidelines and prioritization groups.
TS: Do you think there’s a chance Pfizer might not be able to meet its enrollment goals?
GS: It is an international study and planned to be across multiple countries, multiple sites. My concern is, I don’t know that they would never meet their goal, but will they be able to meet it in a timely enough fashion to give us data that is helpful during the still ongoing pandemic?
TS: Would observational data be sufficient for a full FDA approval or is a rigorous, placebo-controlled trial necessary?
GS: That is a decision that the FDA would have to weigh in on to decide if it would be adequate. Right now, there have been discussions with the FDA to consider observational data for what is called real-world evidence, or RWE. Generally speaking, in order to even consider observational data, you do need that data on many thousands of individuals. And it would have to be a planned analysis. . . . For example, take the outcomes of pregnant women prior to the pandemic, maybe in the year 2019 or even during the pandemic, before [a COVID-19] vaccine was available, to compare outcomes. That is not as easy as it sounds, because when you select control groups, there are other biases introduced. For example, how do you compare them based on the same baseline parameters and so forth? But there are ways to attempt to do that.

COVID-19 Hospitalizations Tank a Month After Vaccines Roll Out/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GEMPHOTOGRAPHY

ew results from England- and Scotland-based studies suggest that the UK’s COVID-19 vaccination program is effective at reducing hospitalizations and the risk of contracting the disease. 
Preliminary findings from a study of the Scottish population found that there were 85 percent fewer hospital admissions for people who received the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine four weeks prior compared with those who were unvaccinated. Similarly, one shot of Oxford/AstraZeneca’s version was tied to a reduction in hospitalizations of up 94 percent, according to the Associated Press. The results, which have not yet undergone peer review, were posted to The Lancet’s preprint site on February 19.
A second study, which was posted to The Lancet’s preprint site on February 22, of health care workers in England found that one shot of Pfizer’s vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of contracting the disease by 70 percent, while the second shot was tied to a reduced risk of 85 percent, according to the AP.
“This new evidence shows that the jab protects you, and protects those around you,” Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, tells the AP. “It is important that we see as much evidence as possible on the vaccine’s impact on protection and on transmission and we will continue to publish evidence as we gather it.”
See “Pfizer’s COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Viral Load: Study”
The results from England also suggest that people aged over 80 who were vaccinated with a single Pfizer shot were 57 percent less likely to contract the disease three to four weeks after immunization, and this figure rose to more than 85 percent after the second dose.
The UK has delayed giving some people their second shot in order to spread around the doses, thereby delivering the partial protection conferred from one vaccine dose, The New York Times reports. More than 17.5 million people in the UK, about one-third of the population, have already received one vaccine shot, the AP reports. But experts say it’s unclear how this strategy will play out in the long term. 
“We now need to understand how long lasting this protection is for one dose of the vaccine,” Arne Akbar, a professor at University College London and the president of the British Society for Immunology, tells the Times.

COVID-19 Vaccines for Pregnant Moms May Protect Newborns/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DARIO SINTONI

regnant women with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for severe illness and death compared to people with COVID-19 who are not pregnant, and they experience preterm birth and pregnancy loss more frequently than do expecting moms who don’t catch the virus. In spite of these risks, there is no clear guidance available yet for vaccinating pregnant women against COVID-19. But there is now some evidence that immunization could protect their newborns. For the first time, doctors report that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a vaccinated mother can cross the placenta, pointing to a likely benefit for her fetus.
“It validates what we’ve always suspected . . . that mothers can be vaccinated during pregnancy and can provide some of that level of immunity to their unborn child,” says Chad Rudnick, a pediatrician at Florida Atlantic University and one of the authors of the study, which was posted as a preprint to medRxiv February 5. 
His case report documents the experience of a front-line healthcare worker who opted to receive her first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine while 36 weeks pregnant. The mother was considered not to have had COVID-19 previously because she had no history of exposure or symptoms, although she was not tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to vaccination. After the birth of her baby at 39 weeks, Rudnick detected IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the cord blood, confirming the transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus via the placenta.
Rudnick says that he and coauthor Paul Gilbert, a pediatrician at Florida Atlantic, had not planned to do a study on COVID-19 vaccination in a pregnant woman, but when the opportunity presented itself, they recognized it as a chance to get a first look at how vaccine immunity might be passed along to a fetus.
See “Breastmilk Harbors Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2”
Vaccines for influenza and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TDaP) are commonly used in pregnancy because of their protective effects for newborns, who have few of their own immune defenses. Rudnick says he hopes the same will be true of COVID-19 vaccines, “because we do know that little babies can get hospitalized from COVID. They can sometimes have severe illness.” 
The study did not quantify the levels of antibodies in the maternal blood, so there’s no indication of the efficiency of antibody transfer, and the researchers can’t say whether the antibodies in the infant were protective. Also, because it was a case study of only one subject, the paper was not able to suggest the ideal timing of maternal vaccination.
COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women
A recent publication in JAMA Pediatrics showing that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can similarly cross the placenta during natural infection offers some clues about the optimal timing window for vaccination. Karen Puopolo, a neonatologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and colleagues found SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the placentas from 72 out of 83 pregnant women who had previously had the virus. The concentration of antibodies in the cord blood correlated with maternal antibody concentration and the time between infection and delivery. Specifically, if the mom’s antibodies levels were high, so were the levels in the cord blood, and the longer before delivery that she had the infection, the greater the abundance of antibodies. 
“That kind of makes sense for a new disease,” says Puopolo. “It takes some time for your body to make an antibody response, and then it takes some time for that antibody to be transferred across the placenta.” Her team found that 17 days before birth was the minimum time for maternal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to show up in the cord blood after infection. That same window may apply to vaccination as well, she says.    
See “Human Fetuses Can Contract SARS-CoV-2, but It’s Rare”
These results highlight an ongoing debate about the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical studies, including trials of COVID-19 vaccines. According to Puopolo, the reluctance to experiment on pregnant women is grounded in good intentions, “but it can be taken too far, and when it’s taken so far that pregnant women and their newborns may not be able to benefit from research that could be helpful to them, then we’ve gone too far.” 
Geeta Swamy, who studies maternal immunization at Duke University, agrees that pregnant women should have been included in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. “The problem now is that we’re going to be faced with the potential difficulties in enrolling women in studies when they could be getting the vaccine already.” That’s because pregnant women can receive the vaccines that have emergency use authorization if they fall into the eligible groups, while in a placebo-controlled study, participants typically have a 50 percent chance of receiving the placebo.
Swamy is preparing to begin an observational study of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She is a member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, although she does not participate in any COVID-related decisions due to her involvement as a coinvestigator for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine trial, which did not accept pregnant women, at the Duke clinical trial site.
Currently, the most authoritative guidance for COVID-19 vaccinations for pregnant women comes from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which advises that the vaccine should not be withheld due to pregnancy, and that women should make their own decision after consulting with their physician. While awaiting more data about the risks and benefits of the vaccine during pregnancy, these early studies suggest that a vaccination could provide newborns with some level of protection against infection.

Correction (February 18): The article previously stated that the mother who received the vaccine had tested negative for antibodies before her immunization, but she was not tested. We have clarified that, based on her lack of exposure and symptoms, the doctors considered her to not have had COVID-19. The Scientist regrets the error.
COVID-19 More Deadly with Blood than Solid Cancer: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MOTORTION
P
atients with hematologic cancers such as leukemia who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are more likely to die than are those with solid cancers who contract the infection and go to the hospital, according to an analysis posted as a preprint to In Review on February 2. The researchers suggest that compromised immune responses could lead to these poor outcomes in blood cancer patients with acute COVID-19, as they found that a depletion of CD8+ T cells was associated with the highest mortality among all the participants.
“If you think about it, it makes sense. Patients with leukemia by definition have a cancer of the immune system,” says Mikkael Sekeres, the chief of hematology at the University of Miami’s Sylvester Cancer Center who was not involved in the study. Corrupted bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, which is why people with leukemia are more susceptible to infection in the first place, adds Sekeres, who belongs to an American Society of Hematology research group gathering ongoing data about clinical outcomes of blood cancer patients with COVID-19.
Since early on in the pandemic, multiple studies have found that cancer patients with COVID-19 have higher mortality rates than patients without cancer, especially if the cancer is in their blood. The reason is unclear. “Maybe inadequate immune responses are part of the problem,” says Santosha Vardhana, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an author of the study.
Even when [blood cancer patients] have cleared the virus, they then seem to still have a lingering effect of COVID, so it looks more like a chronic infection.
—Sheeba Irshad, King’s College London
Vardhana and colleagues wanted to learn which immune profiles correlate with a higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19, and if blood cancer patients were more likely than others to have the riskiest of those profiles. They compared the mortality rates and immune profiles of blood and solid cancer patients with COVID-19 at Sloan Kettering in New York and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
They saw elevated mortality rates among hospitalized patients with blood cancer and COVID-19 compared to those with other cancers, as in the earlier studies. Among 45 blood cancer patients with COVID-19 at Sloan Kettering, for example, almost half died in the hospital compared to 20 percent of 39 people with solid cancer.
In a group of COVID-19 patients at Penn, more than half with blood cancer (12 of 22) died within 30 days of leaving the hospital. This was true for one-third (26 of 78) of those with solid cancer.
The immune profiles of these two groups might explain the difference, Vardhana says. Compared to COVID-19 patients with solid cancer, those with blood cancer had elevated levels of inflammatory markers that suggested a heightened immune response to the virus.
“Even when [blood cancer patients] have cleared the virus, they then seem to still have a lingering effect of COVID, so it looks more like a chronic infection,” says Sheeba Irshad, an oncologist at King’s College London who has also profiled the immune responses of cancer patients to COVID-19 but was not involved in this study. Irshad says that solid cancer patients with COVID-19 generally mount an immune response like that of people without cancer, whereas the immune profiles of blood cancer patients are distinctive.
A detailed analysis of the lymphocytes of 45 COVID-19 patients, conducted at Penn, supports Irshad’s claim. Just like those without cancer, most solid cancer patients had a balanced complement of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells—all of which are critical for adaptive immunity to a virus. In contrast, those with blood cancer showed less B cell and CD4+ T immune cell production, indicating compromised immunity.
At Sloan Kettering, blood cancer patients with few B cells frequently died in the hospital. Solid cancer patients, on the other hand, found it easier to maintain their B cell counts and usually lived as long as they had enough CD8+ T cells. Patients who faced significant CD8+ T cell depletion, across all cancer types, died in the hospital 71 percent of the time even when their B cell responses were adequate.
Vardhana notes that some chemotherapies suppress T cells, making it an open question whether COVID-19 itself or a cancer patient’s chemotherapy contributes more to T cell depletion. He says he hopes to tackle this question in future research.
Implications for COVID-19 vaccines for cancer patients
This study arrives as COVID-19 vaccination programs are ramping up in the United States, prompting the American Association for Cancer Research’s COVID-19 and Cancer Task Force to call for cancer patients to receive priority vaccine access because having cancer is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. While this aligns with recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is little direct evidence of the interaction between the vaccine and cancer because many people with cancer were excluded from vaccine trials.
Vardhana argues that vaccination could be helpful for many cancer patients, though, given that both currently approved vaccines in the US generate a robust CD8+ T cell response.
“Based on the fact that we have some data to suggest that a T cell response is important and helpful, it’s reasonable to get [the vaccine],” Vardhana says. Irshad is more cautious, arguing that more evidence of the specific benefits of vaccines for cancer patients is needed. Her recommendation is that everyone who cares for someone with cancer—family members and health care workers—be vaccinated so that there is some degree of protection around that person.

What Pseudoviruses Bring to the Study of SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DUSAN STANKOVIC
W
hen SARS-CoV-2 first began spreading across the globe, not every lab was equipped to study it directly. The virus behind the current pandemic is highly pathogenic and transmissible, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require many of the same biosafety guidelines that shape the study of diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola.
As in many moments throughout the last year, the scientific community responded by creatively adapting existing tools to the study of COVID-19. Among these, researchers turned to models of the pathogen such as pseudoviruses and chimeric viruses that can be studied safely in labs with lower biosafety level (BSL) clearance than required for studying the wildtype version, in an effort to expand the study of the novel coronavirus. Pseudoviruses don’t replicate, rendering them harmless, but by replacing their surface envelope proteins with those of SARS-CoV-2, researchers can glean insights into the ways the pathogen infects cells. A chimeric virus is made by inserting the genetic material of one virus into the genome of another, safe surrogate, and these introduced sequences are passed on when the virus replicates.  
In addition to their safety, pseudoviruses are “extremely versatile in that you can . . . introduce different envelope proteins and you can introduce mutations, which is making it extremely useful for us to screen a lot of different variants,” says Carol Weiss, a virologist who heads the laboratory of immunoregulation at the US Food and Drug Administration. “If you want to introduce mutations in real viruses, it’s a whole lot more work.”
An approximation of the real thing
Pseudoviruses were first developed in the 1960s, after scientists began studying a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolated from cattle. In addition to replicating well in culture, they later learned that its surface protein, VSV-G, facilitates entry into all eukaryotic cells, making the virus a useful vector not only as a pseudovirus but as a ferry to deliver DNA into cells for therapeutic purposes. The first Ebola vaccine was developed using a VSV platform, and more recently, the virus has been engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells. 
HIV-based platforms, which came about in the 1980s, have since replaced VSV as the most common model for developing both pseudo- and chimeric viruses. Unlike VSV’s negative-strand RNA genome that must be transcribed once inside the cell, HIV’s positive-strand RNA genome can instantly begin translation, making pseudoviruses based on HIV faster to produce. HIV-based model viruses have now been used in many of the same applications as VSV, with scientists applying them to the study of diseases such as AIDS, SARS, MERS, and influenza.
We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2.
—Sean Whelan, Washington University
To harness these surrogates to study SARS-CoV-2, researchers first needed to prove that their pseudo- and chimeric viruses are viable stand-ins for the real thing. SARS-CoV-2 is a uniquely bulky virus—its genome is roughly 30 kilobases, while HIV and VSV sit around 10 kilobases—and while it is more similar to HIV, none of the three are closely related. Fortunately, both HIV and VSV appear to be compatible for making coronavirus models.
Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis, is one of many scientists who has developed a viable chimeric virus platform and quantified its performance in the face of antibodies against the real thing. To do this, he developed two complimentary assays—one for use in infectious disease laboratories with the BSL-3 clearance required to handle live SARS-CoV-2 and another for labs working under a lower, BSL-2 clearance—and studied how each virus responded to a battery of different treatments. It wasn’t enough, he says, to test the viruses’ ability to evade just one type of antibody, so he used monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and serum from recovered COVID-19 patients—as well as a type of ACE2 decoy protein suggested as a possible therapeutic to draw the virus away from the cells’ own receptor. “We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2.” 
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
The BSL-2 assay Whelan designed uses a chimeric VSV that includes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and produces a green fluorescent protein as a signal for infection (luciferase is also often used). Whelan exposed human cells to his chimeric virus until 100 cells had been infected. Then, he bathed the cells in each type of antibody and the decoy protein and recorded how quickly and to what extent the chimeric virus was able to escape them.
Simultaneously, Whelan’s colleague Mike Diamond, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine, developed a BSL-3 assay using a live clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to Whelan’s assay, he exposed 100 infected cells to the same litany of tests and used immunostaining to track infected cells over time. 
The results, published in Cell Host and Microbe in September, demonstrate that the two assays produce neutralization profiles for each exposure that align 93 percent of the time, meaning that the chimeric virus is a suitable proxy for assessing the ability of antibodies to shut down SARS-CoV-2. Many papers have published similar results, comparing their assays against wildtype coronavirus. This validation against the true virus is important, Whelan says, because a chimeric virus “looks like COVID from the outside, but it’s not COVID on the inside.”
A speedy means for tracking emerging variants
While studies involving true isolates of SARS-CoV-2 will always be the gold standard for understanding the complex dynamics of COVID-19, there are instances in which pseudo- and chimeric viruses are better choices. For one, such models are inherently more genetically stable than their wildtype counterparts. Viruses change a bit each time they interact with a new host, and individual copies within a single person might not be identical. In the lab, viruses can also evolve new mutations in response to the types of cells used to culture them. Viruses propagated in monkey cells, for example, may adopt different mutations than those cultured in human cells.
One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory.
—Carol Weiss, US Food and Drug Administration
When scientists engineer proxies of SARS-CoV-2, they can control for some of that variation by using plasmids that all contain a single clone of the spike protein. “One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory,” the FDA’s Weiss tells The Scientist. “It’s not a mixture of mutations. We know exactly what we’re testing.”
In some instances, researchers specifically want to study new mutations to, say, see how they might change the efficacy of vaccines. Already, notable variants have emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil that dampen the effectiveness of some vaccines. South Africa recently halted the rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after it produced only a weak response against mild and moderate illness, and Moderna announced plans to modify the second iteration of its vaccine in an effort to remain robust against these new variants. For studying such mutations in the spike protein, pseudoviruses offer a much faster model for generating and testing new versions than the actual virus does. 
See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”
Rather than having to clone each new variant as it emerges in wildtype specimens to assess whether a vaccinated individual’s antibodies will be effective, pseudoviruses allow scientists to quickly create new models with the same mutations to run their experiments. Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University, says that she routinely screens as many as 1,000 pseudovirus samples within 48 hours to determine whether any are a cause for concern, a process that would take much longer were she waiting for live clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the same mutations. With pseudoviruses, “you are able to test a lot more samples much faster with the appropriate replicates.” 
Hatziioannou’s team recently tested the blood of 20 patients who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and identified individuals who mounted a robust antibody response to the virus. They extracted and isolated 18 unique antibodies associated with the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) and exposed a VSV-based chimeric virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike to each antibody type individually to see which mutations are selects for as the virus replicates. 
Next, they engineered HIV-based pseudoviruses with each unique spike mutation that resulted from the VSV experiments and used their own neutralization assay to determine whether the mutations conferred resistance to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. To confirm that the virus would behave the same when exposed to a cocktail of many different antibodies, as in a human body, the researchers also pitted the pseudoviruses against plasma taken from recovered patients. 
Their results, shared on the preprint server bioRxiv on January 19 and recently accepted in Nature, demonstrate that many mutations do decrease the ability of neutralizing antibodies to effectively combat the virus. “In all cases, the mutations identified by the VSV [chimeric virus] were mutations that conferred resistance in the HIV pseudotype,” Hatziioannou says, although she adds that vaccines are still an important tool. When they looked specifically at mutations found in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants, first identified in South Africa and the UK, respectively, they found that the neutralizing ability “was a bit weaker than a virus without these substitutions, but the effects were overall small.”
Where pseudo- and chimeric viruses fall short
While these surrogate platforms have been useful tools for studying how SARS-CoV-2 enters our cells, there will always be a need for BSL-3 labs that can study the virus directly. “The disadvantage of using pseudotypes is that the only biological property that you’re really going to learn about coronaviruses is those properties that relate to the spike protein,” Vicente Planelles, a pathologist at the University of Utah, tells The Scientist. “As soon as we go beyond the processes that the spike is responsible for, we need a different model.”
No pseudovirus platform can fully recapitulate how the virus propagates and releases new copies of itself, for example, nor can scientists use them to study other mechanisms by which the virus circumvents the body’s immune system. 
In addition, while pseudoviruses are useful for assessing the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapies, they are less helpful with respect to evaluating other drugs that treat the severity of the disease. Remdesivir, for example, was highlighted as a promising option early in the pandemic before conflicting evidence cast its effectiveness into doubt. But the family of drugs to which remdesivir belongs, called nucleoside analogs, could prove useful in preventing extreme illness if scientists could find a better candidate. These drugs work by interfering with a virus’s ability to replicate, which pseudoviruses do not do. “If we found nucleoside analogs that work better than remdesivir, we would be in great shape,” Planelles says. “But you cannot probe that with a pseudovirus, because the gene [that the drug targets] is an internal gene that is not the spike.”

Another Potentially Immunity-Evading SARS-CoV-2 Variant Detected/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK, RONSTIK

esearchers in the UK have identified a new SARS-CoV-2 variant with mutations that could allow it to evade immunity-conferring neutralizing antibodies.
Known as B.1.525, the variant was first detected in the UK and Nigeria in December. It’s since been found in 11 other countries, including Denmark, the US, and Australia.
B.1.525 sports a handful of mutations, including one on the spike protein called E484K. This mutation is also found in variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil and seems to help the virus evade antibodies, The Guardian reports. In addition, B.1.525 has similarities to the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant that also emerged in the UK.
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
“We don’t yet know how well this [new] variant will spread, but if it is successful it can be presumed that immunity from any vaccine or previous infection will be blunted,” Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading in the UK, tells The Guardian.
Moderna and Pfizer are already working to develop booster shots to give vaccines an edge against the slew of new virus variants. The good news is that because many of the variants share the same mutations, new vaccine versions are likely to confer immunity to multiple versions, according to The Guardian. “This [E484K] change seems to be the key change at the moment to allow escape, so that’s the one you put into the tweaked vaccine,” Jonathan Stoye, a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, tells the news outlet.

There is no evidence that B.1.525 causes more severe illness or is more transmissible, Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, says in a statement, according to Reuters.

hen SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, first emerged, scientists expected it to evolve slowly because the virus copies its big RNA genome with a polymerase that also corrects errors, thus minimizing the chance for certain types of mutations. This enzyme functionality isn’t present in other RNA viruses such as influenza and HIV, which accumulate single nucleotide polymorphisms, where one nucleotide is substituted for another, much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 does.
This genomic stability was thought to be good news for vaccine design, but it’s become apparent in recent months, with the emergence of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and other variants, that SARS-CoV-2 is mutable—and might put up a fight against neutralizing antibodies that go after the spike protein of the virus. In a study posted as a preprint in November and published February 3 in Science, researchers showed that SARS-CoV-2 tends to delete portions of RNA that encode the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike, a mutation that its proofreader can’t detect. These findings and those of other groups offer an explanation for how new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise and escape antibody recognition by the host immune system.
Deletion “represents a way to rapidly alter an entire stretch of amino acids and more rapidly alter the structures that those amino acids are contributing to,” says coauthor Kevin McCarthy, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh. These mutations “could accelerate [SARS-CoV-2] evolution and then complement mutations that it’s already making.”
The project started when two physicians at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center contacted Paul Duprex, a virologist and the director of the Center for Vaccine Research at Pitt. The doctors had an immunocompromised cancer patient who passed away after a SARS-CoV-2 infection that lasted 74 days and did not respond to common treatments, including Remdesivir and dexamethasone. So Duprex and his team took a look at the viral genome to see if they could figure out why the infection lasted so long. 
From samples aspirated from the patient’s trachea 72 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, the researchers isolated viral RNA from several SARS-CoV-2 variants, which likely evolved from one initial infection during the long illness, and sequenced the S gene, which encodes the spike protein. They found two variants that contained different three-nucleotide deletions in the NTD of the spike protein.
Duprex mentioned the findings to McCarthy, who, with help from collaborators, combed through the nearly 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences that had been deposited by the end of October 2020 in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. The researchers found 1,108 viral genomes that had deletions of varying lengths in the S gene, 90 percent of which were located at one of four sites in the NTD.
Many of the deletions were in patient samples that appeared to be persistent infections, similar to the one the Pittsburgh patient experienced. And some of the most concerning new variants, including B.1.1.7, initially identified in the UK, and B.1.351, first spotted in South Africa, have one or two of these short deletions in the NTD, along with a cluster of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike, which must attach to the ACE2 receptor in order to enter host cells.
Deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence (horizontal cyan bar) affect the shape of different parts of the protein (cyan). The bar graph at left shows the relative frequency of recurrent deletions in the correspondingly colored parts of the spike protein. Deletions tend to occur outside the region that binds to cells at the beginning of the infection.
KEVIN MCCARTHY AND PAUL DUPREX
The researchers then tested whether six of these deletions would disrupt antibody binding. Three of those deletions and one deletion combination in the NTD eliminated the ability of an antibody previously isolated from a convalescent patient to neutralize the virus. This specific antibody completely lost its effectiveness, but convalescent serum, which contains a full set of antibodies, not just one, did neutralize each of these variants. 
Antibodies “are swarms looking at the different shapes of different parts of the molecule, so it’s not all or nothing whenever we’re thinking about the swarms of antibodies, but it absolutely is all or nothing when you’re thinking about this particular antibody, which binds at this particular space,” explains Duprex.
NTD deletion variants and vaccine potency
The next steps are “to catalog the effects of these deletions on a large collection of plasma samples,” including from survivors and vaccine recipients, Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York who was not part of the work, tells The Scientist. She says this could help answer questions about vaccine efficacy, reinfection, and if vaccines design should account for deletions. These mutations are “just a part of all the variation seen in spike at the moment.”
The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two approved for use in the United States, both include RNA encoding the full-length spike protein. Once injected into a person, the RNA is translated into protein, and the recipient’s immune system then responds to and develops a memory of the encounter. According to a COVID-19 vaccine candidate tracker published on February 12 by the World Health Organization, 11 vaccines that initiate immunity to just the RBD of the spike are at various stages of clinical trials. 
“The message to the vaccine world is that it was the correct choice to use full length spike . . . and those others, who based [strategies] only on the RBD, are missing” parts of the protein, in this case the rest of the spike, particularly the NTD, which patients have been shown to mount an antibody response to, says Gregory Ippolito, an immunologist at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin who was not involved in the work. Ippolito and his colleagues, part of a team led by George Georgiou at UT Austin, posted a preprint to bioRxiv in December showing that more than 80 percent of the antibodies to portions of the spike in four convalescent patients bound to domains other than the RBD. Thus, vaccines that leave out portions of the spike protein don’t give recipients’ immune systems the chance to develop a full complement of antibodies to protect them from the virus, and risk becoming less effective when the spike protein mutates.
The study also points to considerations for therapeutics that give passive immunity, such as antibody cocktails, says Jason Lavinder, another member of the team at UT Austin. It’s important to include “in those cocktails not just RBD-directed antibodies, but also NTD-directed antibodies.”

Are Climate-Driven Shifts in Bat Diversity to Blame for COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK, VONKARA1
M
ost evidence scientists have generated since the start of the pandemic points to bats as the likely source of the COVID-19–causing coronavirus. A shift in the global distribution of the winged mammals due to climate change may be responsible for recent disease outbreaks, according to a study published January 26 in Science of The Total Environment. 
The authors of the paper estimate that bat diversity increased the most in an area that includes Myanmar, Laos, and southern China—where SARS-CoV-2 likely originated—thereby increasing the chances of a bat-borne disease spreading to humans.
“Our estimates add to previous studies that have highlighted the effect that climate change can have on the global distribution of pathogen-carrying wildlife,” Robert Beyer, a research fellow at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and the lead author of the study, tells The Scientist in an email. “We know that these shifts in species’ ranges can play a critical role in the transmission and evolution of harmful viruses. It is therefore important to consider the impact of climate change also in the context of emerging infectious diseases and global public health.”
Other experts say these findings should be interpreted with caution because the predictions are difficult to verify. “Overall I’m not convinced the analysis is robust enough to draw the conclusions asserted,” Matthew Struebig, a conservation scientist at the University of Kent who was not involved in the research, tells The Scientist in an email.
We know that these shifts in species’ ranges can play a critical role in the transmission and evolution of harmful viruses.
—Robert Beyer, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
Compared with other mammals, bats carry more than their fair share of potentially zoonotic viruses, pathogens that could infect humans. Each species of furry flier hosts an average of 2.7 coronavirus strains, according to one estimate. It follows that as bat diversity increases in a region, so too does the diversity of these spike-studded viruses. If climate change has altered the distribution of bats—and the pathogens they carry—this could influence the likelihood of a disease jumping to humans, Beyer and his colleagues hypothesized.
“It’s a numbers game,” says Sarah Olson, a wildlife epidemiologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York who wasn’t involved with the research. “The more [viral] diversity you have, the more likely it is for viruses to emerge that have the potential to infect humans.”
To estimate how global bat diversity changed between 1901 and 1930 and between 1990 and 2019, Beyer and his colleagues used estimates of temperature, precipitation, sunshine, and carbon dioxide levels to predict global distributions of different vegetation types. By comparing vegetation maps with the habitat requirements and geographic limits of all known bat species, the team predicted total bat species richness at each time period.
Based on this analysis, the team identified several regions where bat diversity may have increased the most: Central Africa, scattered patches in Central and South America, and a large area in southeast Asia, which includes parts of Myanmar, Laos, and China’s Yunnan province. In that Asian region, the researchers estimated that climate change has converted large swathes of tropical shrublands to tropical savannas and deciduous woodland, thereby making the region more suitable for an additional 40 bat species—and around 100 extra coronavirus strains. Because this estimated bat hotspot matches the regions where both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are believed to have emerged, the researchers speculate that climate change may have contributed to the emergence of these viral outbreaks.
Olson says that the study is “pushing us to think about drivers of emerging infectious diseases in some new ways.” But, she adds, the findings are speculative and “difficult, if not impossible, to validate.” The study’s conclusions rely on estimates of vegetation for the 1901–1930 time period that cannot be corroborated by satellite or on-the-ground data, says Olson. And because the study relied on climate data to estimate habitat types, it did not consider land-use changes, which could alter the suitability of areas for bats.
Struebig says that he is skeptical of the study’s link between climate change and bat diversity. “There are too many assumptions for me to conclude that climate change could have increased the likelihood of the pandemic occurring in this way.”
Struebig says that the analysis relies on bat distribution data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “As a member of the IUCN Bat Specialist Group I can tell you that the information we have available to map distributions is grossly insufficient. Many species are not fully assessed, and . . . very little is known about optimum or preferred vegetation types. . . . The study estimates the bat fauna of southern China and neighbouring countries increased by a whopping 40+ species in around 120 years. To put that into perspective that would mean the number of bat species in Myanmar doubled in little over a century! Simply looking back at old species accounts and ecological studies from the region shows this simply did not happen.”
Olson says that although the findings don’t provide conclusive evidence that bat distribution influenced the pandemic, the study helps draw attention to the issue. “We’re altering environments in ways we don’t really understand or appreciate until we have an event like [the COVID-19 pandemic] that makes us reassess our relationship with nature,” she says. “I think [the study] kind of opens the door and says, ‘Hey, here are some other ways that we’re impacting the environment that might be altering the distribution and richness of species.’ And we need to pay attention to that when it comes to [understanding] emerging infectious disease risk moving forward.”

Pfizer’s COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Viral Load: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK, ALEXANDROS MICHAILIDIS
P
eople who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 after receiving one dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine harbored about four times less virus than did unvaccinated people who caught the virus, according to preliminary results posted to the preprint server medRxiv on February 8.
Several COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer’s version, are about 95 percent effective in preventing disease. But there’s less known about whether vaccinated individuals can still transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to others. 
In the study, which has not yet undergone peer review, researchers in Israel measured the viral loads in 2,897 unvaccinated people and in 2,897 age- and sex-matched people who had received their first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The authors conclude in their report that “viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12–28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread.”
Viral abundance could drop further after the vaccine’s second dose, Cyrille Cohen, a vaccine expert at Bar-Ilan University who advises Israel’s health ministry on COVID-19 vaccines and wasn’t involved with the study, tells The Times of Israel. “This is a game-changer to some extent,” he says. “After all, transmissibility after the vaccine has been one of the most important questions we are asking ourselves.”
Israel’s rollout of the Pfizer vaccine is among the most effective COVID-19 vaccination programs in the world, according to Reuters. The country started its vaccine drive, which initially targeted older and at-risk groups, on December 19. Since then, more than half of its eligible population—about 3.5 million people—have received one or both doses. 
Already, some results from Israel’s vaccination efforts have emerged, Reuters reports. In people aged over 60—the group prioritized for vaccinations—there was a 53 percent drop in new cases between January 16 and February 6. Hospitalization and severe cases have also declined by more than 30 percent in this age group. In those aged younger than 60—who became eligible for the vaccine later—there was a 20 percent reduction in new cases during the same period, but hospitalizations and severe cases rose by 15 and 29 percent, respectively. Reuters did not provide an explanation for opposing trends in the younger group.
Pfizer’s vaccine appears to retain its 90–95 percent effectiveness against the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant, which was first detected in the UK and is rapidly spreading around the world, Hezi Levi, the director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry, tells Reuters. “It’s too early to say anything about the South African variant.”

WHO Discounts Idea that SARS-CoV-2 Leaked from a Lab/-/ABOVE: Wuhan, China

nvestigators from the World Health Organization on a mission in China to track down the roots of the COVID-19 pandemic report that the prevailing hypothesis—that SARS-CoV-2 originated in an animal host and worked its way, possibly through intermediate hosts, to humans—is supported by their evidence. 
An alternative proposal that the virus came from a lab is “extremely unlikely,” Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s food safety and animal disease specialist and chair of the investigative team, tells The Guardian. It “isn’t a hypothesis we suggest implies further study. . . . There had been no publication or research of this virus or one close to this virus, anywhere in the world.”
See “Theory that Coronavirus Escaped from a Lab Lacks Evidence”
For nearly a month, Embarek’s team has been in Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 was first noticed in late 2019. The Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan had been identified as a common factor in the early cases, and the WHO group found animals sold there that have the potential to carry SARS-CoV-2 and that come from farms located in regions where bats harbor coronavirus relatives, virologist Marion Koopmans of the WHO team tells the Associated Press.
“The possible path from whatever original animal species all the way through to the Huanan market could have taken a very long and convoluted path involving also movements across borders,” Embarek told reporters at a press conference, Reuters reports. It’s also possible that frozen foods contaminated with the virus ushered SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, but Embarek said it’s not clear if virus on frozen products could lead to human infections.
Liang Wannian, who leads China’s team investigating the outbreak, said at the press briefing that COVID-19 cases were detected in late 2019 that weren’t connected to the seafood market, but no substantial outbreaks were going on elsewhere. “We haven’t been able to fully do the research, but there is no indication there were clusters before what we saw happen in the later part of December in Wuhan,” Liang told reporters.
According to The Guardian, Liang says the WHO’s digging will continue, while China’s investigation into COVID-19’s origins is complete.

T
he optimistic mood around COVID-19 vaccine rollouts has been clouded by new variants of the virus, which could trample the efficacy of vaccines or escape them entirely. Already, recent trial results from Johnson & Johnson and from Novavax suggest that a variant that first arose in South Africa (B.1.351) and probably a variant identified in Brazil (P.1) are partially escaping protection provided by their vaccines. 
Specifically, mutations in the viruses’ spike proteins allow them to avoid being bound by antibodies produced after vaccination or natural infection. “The South African variant appears to partially escape antibody responses,” says Dan Barouch, the director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. With novel variants expected to emerge, the question is, which vaccines would be quickest to rejig and manufacture if updates become necessary?  
A few vaccine makers have already announced that they are gearing up for second generation vaccines. “It may not be necessary, but is probably good insurance to buy right now,” says immunologist Alessandro Sette of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. 
A quick fix
Of the common approaches to design—or redesign—a vaccine, mRNA vaccines are the most expeditious. They pack the genetic recipe for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inside a nanoparticle, which is engulfed by cells that then manufacture the protein and tutor the immune system to recognize it. “They are using chemically synthesized mRNA. There’s no cells needed, so it is so much quicker to make and then purify,” says immunologist Sarah Caddy of the University of Cambridge. 
Moderna designed its mRNA construct last January and had it ready for testing by March 2020. Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine was not far behind, and was the first to gain emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, beating Moderna by one week last December. 
It wouldn’t surprise me if every vaccine maker is now making versions that will tackle the Brazilian and South African strain, and [the] UK [strain] for good measure.
—Luke O’Neill, Trinity College Dublin
“The simpler the vaccine, the easier and faster it would be to ‘update’ it,” Wolfgang Leitner, head of the innate immunity section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tells The Scientist in an email. “Changing an RNA-sequence would ‘only’ require switching out the plasmid that’s used as a template to make the RNA, and modifying a sequence in a plasmid is also quite simple.” Indeed, Moderna was quick off the blocks again, announcing late last month that it had a candidate booster vaccine encoding B.1.351’s spike protein ready to be tested in a clinical trial in the US. 
Arguably the next quickest vaccine type to manufacture is the vector-based variety, which delivers the spike protein recipe using a live virus. To make the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca’s product, for example, living “producer cells” from a human cell line are engineered to become mini vaccine factories, before being burst open to release a weakened adenovirus vector carrying the spike protein gene. “That will take about twice as long [as mRNA vaccine production], so three months to make an AstraZeneca-type vaccine,” says Luke O’Neill, an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin. But according to Caddy, updating vector-based vaccines should be as straightforward as revamping mRNA ones. “The sequence just needs to be inserted into the adenovirus sequence, then the adenovirus grown and purified.”
Another option to fight off mutants is to change not just the spike sequence delivered by vector-based and mRNA vaccines, but to add additional proteins from the virus to their cargo. Caddy advocates for including the nucleoprotein that wraps around the virus genome in COVID-19 vaccines. “The nucleoprotein doesn’t mutate anywhere near as much,” she says, “and mutations there are more likely to make the virus nonfunctional.” 
“There are a couple vaccines in the pipeline (but far from being ready for prime-time) that encode additional viral proteins,” notes Leitner. “The challenge is that they are more complex and, therefore, take longer to develop.”
Barouch agrees. Adding nonspike proteins would “increase complexity and slow down timelines,” he says, so will likely not be done unless the spike-only vaccines fail.  
All about that spike?
While adding additional antigens to mRNA and vector-based vaccines would slow down production times for these rapidly produced vaccines, another popular vaccine approach already has the advantage of triggering the immune system to recognize multiple parts of the virus: inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This approach involves producing large amounts of virus in cell culture, then treating the viruses with a chemical to render them no longer infectious. This process can take more time—not to mention the challenges of standardizing inactivation and conducting essential quality checks to ensure the virus is indeed safe—and so vaccines of this type have lagged behind mRNA and vector-based vaccines. But the upside is that the immune system sees an entire virus, not just the spike protein. 
“Even if there are spike mutants, there will be other antibodies that [inactivated vaccines] will bring onto other proteins in the virus,” says O’Neill. For that reason, these vaccines are “more likely to be valuable in the face of variants,” adds Caddy, “because you get a response against other proteins, which are not mutating as quickly as the spike.” 
If and when these upgraded vaccines will be needed is still a big question. 
Leitner adds that producing new vaccines for COVID-19 would simply involve growing a new variant. “When it comes to inactivated viruses, I would actually rank them among the very easy ones to ‘update,’” he says—“as long as the variant grows just as well (maybe even better) as the original virus.”  
Not everyone agrees that targeting more antigens will be helpful. Immunologist Danny Altmann of Imperial College London says T cell and B cell immunity is elicited from many parts of the wildtype virus, “but I can see no hard evidence that there’s strong correlates of protection outside of spike neutralization.” In other words, vaccines that target the spike protein are the most likely to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Immunologist Kingston Mills of Trinity College Dublin agrees that neutralizing the spike is crucial, and that other targets are of peripheral importance to COVID-19 vaccines. “Nonspike proteins may generate T cell responses that may help, but won’t generate neutralizing antibodies, and antibodies against N [nucleoprotein] or other proteins will not have a role in protective immunity,” he says.  
For now, then, vaccine makers are focused on updating the spike protein sequences in their shots to match the variants that appear to be partially evading SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Even for protein-based vaccines—the fourth major strategy for making vaccines for COVID-19, involving the production of the spike protein in the lab, which in Leitner considers to “be the most involved process of them all”—companies are already moving on a second generation of shots. In January, for example, Novavax announced that it started developing new versions of its protein-based vaccine against emerging strains. “Animal studies are underway and we could be in the clinic as soon as a month or two from now,” a spokesperson from Novavax informs The Scientist in an email.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if every vaccine maker is now making versions that will tackle the Brazilian and South African strain, and [the] UK [strain] for good measure,” says O’Neill. 
How soon are vaccine updates needed?
If and when these upgraded vaccines will be needed is still a big question. There are two main strands of evidence to consider in determining how newly emerged variants are affecting vaccine efficacy. First, the most recent clinical trial results: Novavax achieved more than 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 in a Phase 3 trial in the UK, according to an interim analysis, but just 60 percent effective in a smaller trial in South Africa where B.1.351 is rife. For its adenovirus vector–based vaccine, Johnson & Johnson reported efficacy of 72 percent in the US but 66 percent in Latin America and 57 percent in South Africa, where troubling variants are more prevalent. The conclusion is that these spike mutants indeed seem to be reducing the protection that vaccines can provide.  
Second, the lab studies: To explore the effects of variants on the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, researchers took serum from vaccinated people and tested how it fared against the new spike variants. These experiments showed that antibody responses declined six- to eightfold. But because of the high antibody titers the vaccines generate, this is still in the protective range, according to Barouch, who was involved in the development of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. These in vitro results suggest that these vaccines elicit high enough antibody levels to neutralize the new variants.
However, the challenge posed by new variants was highlighted by an announcement that similar lab studies found the AstraZeneca vaccine to provide minimal protection against mild and moderate COVID-19 upon infection with the B.1.351 variant, far less than the protection it provides against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. The Financial Times reported that it had seen trial results to support this finding, though the vaccine’s effectiveness against severe disease has not yet been determined. South Africa paused rollout of the vaccine following the announcement. Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford says in a press release that efforts to develop a new generation of the vaccine are now underway.
It will be difficult to know from serum samples if or when a mutant has escaped a vaccine, partly because researchers do not know where to draw the line between an immune response that is protective against SARS-CoV-2 and one that is not. “We don’t know for sure exactly what kinds of immune responses or what antibody titers are truly necessary for clinical vaccine protection in humans,” says Barouch. When he and his colleagues transferred convalescent serum to macaques and challenged them with SARS-CoV-2, they found that relatively low antibody levels protected the primates, but only if the serum contained adequate levels of CD8+ killer T cells.
The involvement of these T cells, which kill cells infected with virus, complicates the picture. Having more CD8+ T cells is linked to milder COVID-19. So far, from his calculations, Sette says the T cells stimulated by vaccines or infection to an early lineage of SARS-CoV-2 should largely recognize the new variants. He studied T cell responses in COVID-19 and found that an average person’s T cells recognize multiple parts of SARS-CoV-2—“at least 15 to 20 different pieces,” he says, including on the spike and several other proteins.  For that reason, he concludes, “it is very unlikely that the virus could mutate to escape T cell recognition.”
Some vaccines are suspected to provoke a stronger T cell response than others do. Vector-based and mRNA vaccines, for example, mirror natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, forming the spike protein inside cells—a process that is thought to strongly activate killer T cells, says Barouch, whereas “protein-based and inactivated-virus vaccines generally don’t raise a strong CD8 T cell response.” Chemical adjuvants used in protein and inactivated-virus vaccines may promote killer T cells, says Sette, and side-by-side comparisons of T cell and antibodies have not been done yet between vaccines.
“There could be differences among [vaccine] platforms in terms of different immune responses, or different levels of T cell responses,” says Barouch. “That could be why some platforms may be better than others for tackling variants. But that is theoretical, and we don’t know that for sure.” 
Will Delaying Vaccine Doses Cause a Coronavirus Escape Mutant?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HALFPOINT
T
he pandemic has entered a new phase. Millions of people around the world are now receiving their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine each day. In a few countries, including the UK, millions will wait for up to 12 weeks before they receive their second dose. Vaccinating as many people as possible with initial doses before moving on to second doses is intended as the fastest means of inducing a good level of protection within the population. But some experts say they worry that this constitutes a giant experiment in viral evolution, where the potential consequences remain troublingly unclear. 
Among those concerned is Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at the Rockefeller University. “Rolling out a partially effective vaccine regime in the peak of a highly prevalent viral epidemic is just not a great idea if one of your goals is to avoid vaccine resistance,” he says.
There’s a chance, Bieniasz explains, that people waiting for their second dose may have a sub-optimal level of immunity that places selective pressure on the virus. If someone were to become infected during the interval between jabs, that pressure could allow for the emergence of a mutant version of SARS-CoV-2 able to shake off a person’s immune response—a so-called escape variant. Any such variant that also proved capable of causing severe disease could potentially spark a whole new, devastating wave of infections and deaths.
In general, vaccine resistance among pathogens is rare.
Researchers say it’s almost impossible to know whether this will happen, though historical cases of human pathogens evolving vaccine resistance are rare. 
Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser on COVID-19, said last month at a virtual World Economic Forum panel that delaying the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine could increase the likelihood of an escape variant emerging. “It may not be the case, but it gets risky,” he told the audience. 
Scientists advising the UK government have considered the same scenario. In a paper published last month, they wrote, “in the short-term, delaying the second dose would be expected to somewhat increase the probability of emergence of vaccine resistance.” But quantifying the risk is nigh on impossible.
“We can’t really put a number on it,” says Björn Meyer, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, referring to the risk of delayed dosing leading to the evolution of an escape variant. Every time the virus replicates there is a chance that it could mutate into a more transmissible or more deadly form. In a single individual, the odds of this happening are vanishingly small but the picture changes somewhat when you consider that tens of millions of people are currently waiting for their second dose, notes Meyer.
Opportunity for escape
Almost all vaccines in use at the moment require two doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech’s, Oxford/AstraZeneca’s, Moderna’s, Russia’s Sputnik V, and Sinopharm’s products. Meyer adds that the second booster dose has the effect of raising the amount of antibodies in people’s blood but it also improves affinity maturation, in which B cells produce antibodies that are especially effective at binding to the virus and blocking infection. 
Virologists and immunologists don’t yet know exactly what sort of environment would be most likely to prompt a SARS-CoV-2 escape variant to evolve.
It’s possible that, should a second dose be delayed beyond the manufacturer-recommended schedule of, for example, 21 days for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, antibody levels might gradually come down somewhat and provide a suitable environment for escape variant emergence, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. 
It’s impossible to predict whether that will occur because the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines do not provide data on how the efficacy of vaccines changes when a second dose is administered six weeks or later following the first dose. 
“Beyond that, it’s just really hard to say, it’s anybody’s guess,” says Rasmussen.
Crucially, virologists and immunologists don’t yet know exactly what sort of environment would be most likely to prompt a SARS-CoV-2 escape variant to evolve—in other words, what level of suboptimal immune response equates to the highest risk of the virus evolving a successful escape variant. There are thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants known to be in circulation around the world, but just a few of them are thought to be noticeably more transmissible. They could be thought of as partial escape variants, suggests Meyer, because they are less susceptible to neutralization by antibodies but are not thought to evade the broader immune response. Nobody knows what conditions allowed for the emergence of these variants in the first place. 
Past vaccine escape mutants
In general, vaccine resistance among pathogens is rare. Famously, vaccines have succeeded in keeping the highly infectious measles virus at bay since the inoculations were first introduced in the 1960s. And Meyer notes that, while influenza viruses are known to mutate rapidly, their many variants are not generally thought to have evolved as a result of vaccination programs.
A paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2017 by Penn State’s Andrew Read, an expert on the evolutionary genetics of infectious pathogens, and a colleague argues that vaccines may be less likely to cause the emergence of pathogen resistance because they act early to prevent infections and transmission, and vaccines also induce a wide variety of immune responses—from neutralizing antibodies to T and B cell activation. It’s hard for a virus to overcome a variety of different immune response mechanisms all working in unison. “Together, these features drastically increase the time until resistance emerges,” the authors write. 
See “SARS-CoV-2 Isn’t Going Away, Experts Predict”
That doesn’t mean it’s impossible. The hepatitis B virus appeared to evolve resistance to recombinant vaccines in the 1980s partly because the part of the virus targeted in the vaccine-induced immune response was very small. Just a few mutations likely led to the emergence of an escape variant. Reassuringly, the authors of a 2015 review of hepatitis B variants write: “Despite concern, at present the overall impact of vaccine [escape] mutants seems to be low and they do not pose a public health threat or a need to modify the established hepatitis B vaccination programs.” 
Vaccination can influence viral transmission of pathogens that plague other animals besides humans. Take Marek’s disease virus, which infects chickens and some other birds. Although immunized fowl don’t get sick, vaccines for the disease do not prevent the virus spreading, something that is a possibility for the COVID-19 vaccines. “By keeping infected birds alive, vaccination substantially enhances the transmission success and hence spread of virus strains too lethal to persist in unvaccinated populations,” Read and his colleagues conclude in a 2015 study.
Immunity at one dose
In contrast, there are signs that the current COVID-19 vaccines might in fact reduce transmission, and that delaying the second dose does not lead to a significant decline in immunity. A study posted as a preprint February 1 in The Lancet examined data from participants in the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine trial. The authors’ analysis of 88 trial participants found that vaccine efficacy, in terms of reducing symptomatic infection, reached 76 percent between 22 and 90 days following a single dose. 
This could indicate that there is actually a rather low risk of suboptimal immunity arising after just one dose of a two-dose vaccine, says Lucy Walker of University College London. “A vaccine efficacy of seventy-six percent is respectable in its own right and wouldn’t be talked about as ‘partial immunity’ in the context of other vaccines,” she says.
There was also a 54 percent reduction in positive COVID-19 tests among a different subgroup of 500 trial participants who received both doses of the vaccine, regardless of whether they presented as symptomatic or asymptomatic, when compared with the unvaccinated control population. That could mean that the vaccine is able to reduce transmission. If it does, that would in turn reduce the overall risk of escape variants emerging.
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
“While this would be extremely welcome news, we do need more data before this can be confirmed, and so it’s important that we all still continue to follow social distancing guidance after we have been vaccinated,” says Doug Brown, the chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, in a statement to the Science Media Centre. Brown is a trustee of the Association of Medical Research Charities in the UK.
Immunologist Akiko Iwasaki of Yale University notes that those running vaccination programs must weigh the known benefits of using vaccines now to save lives, versus the unknown probability of escape variants causing havoc.
“The UK variant, for example, is more transmissible. Many people are going to die from that if we don’t vaccinate right now,” she says. “Whether one dose encourages variants or not . . . that’s still a theoretical argument.”
But for Paul Bieniasz, the ideal approach would be to use interventions such as social distancing as a means of reducing viral transmission before deploying vaccines, to avoid the risk of stimulating escape variants. 
“Get the virus clamped down, then vaccinate your population,” he says.

Andrew Brooks, Designer of COVID-19 Saliva Test, Dies at 51/-/ABOVE: Andrew Brooks photographed in April 2020 at the RUCDR Infinite Biologics soon after the Rutgers COVID-19 saliva test received emergency approval from the FDA.

ndrew Brooks, a molecular neuroscientist who developed the first COVID-19 saliva test to receive emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, died on January 23 of a heart attack. He was 51.
In the early days of the pandemic, when testing resources such as swabs and reagents were scarce, Brooks’s saliva test offered a fast and reliable way to screen large numbers of people. The test, which he designed while head of the Rutgers-affiliated biorepository RUCDR Infinite Biologics, protected essential workers from exposure to the virus as they collected samples by doing away with the need for technicians to be on-hand to gather the fluid—people could simply spit into a cup. The FDA first authorized the test in April 2020, and a month later expanded marketing for in-home use.
“It completely mitigates the risk of contracting the disease while you’re getting a test,” Brooks told The Scientist in a July 2020 interview. “You don’t have to be in someone’s face like you do for a nasopharyngeal swab,” another type of test that faced severe supply shortages beginning in mid-March.
See “Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19”
Since April, these tests have been administered to more than 4 million people, according to a Rutgers University obituary. During a coronavirus briefing on January 25, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy referred to Brooks as “one of the state’s unsung heroes” whose work during the pandemic had “undoubtedly saved lives.”
Born in February 1969 in Bronxville, New York, Brooks grew up in neighboring New Jersey, The New York Times reports. He attended Cornell University with the intention of pursuing a career in veterinary medicine, but a summer internship at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center convinced him to study human disease. In 2000, Brooks completed a PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of Rochester, where he remained for the next four years as the director of the medical center’s core facilities.
In 2005, Brooks returned to New Jersey to serve as director of the Bionomics Research and Technology Center, a joint initiative between Rutgers University and several neighboring medical institutions. Along the way, he cultivated an interest in the business side of science, working with other researchers to commercialize their products.
Among these initiatives, Brooks became the chief operating officer of the Cell and DNA Repository, a company owned by Rutgers University and later named RUCDR Infinite Biologics that provided data management and analysis services for biological samples. During his early tenure, Brooks helped to grow the company from a handful of employees to several hundred, and it is now the world’s largest university-based biorepository. 
See “First Saliva Test for COVID-19 Approved for Emergency Use by FDA”
In 2018, Brooks oversaw RUCDR’s privatization, a process that culminated in the summer of 2020 after Brooks was named chief executive officer of the newly branded Infinity BiologiX.
It was during his time with RUCDR Infinite Biologics that Brooks designed the saliva test, pulling on his background in molecular genetics to overcome the difficulties in working with saliva, such as its viscosity and the number of DNA-degrading enzymes found in human spit. “There are challenges for every biological sample,” he told The Scientist. “We’ve already addressed a lot of challenges of working with saliva, and [COVID-19] just represented a new target for detection.”
To bring the tests to scale, Brooks received support from Operation Warp Speed and a hefty loan secured through his colleague and friend, Jay Tischfield, a geneticist at Rutgers University and chief executive officer of RUCDR. The lab was able to purchase several multimillion dollar machines to automate the extraction and amplification of each sample using traditional PCR techniques, requiring Brooks to double the lab’s workforce almost overnight. Brooks also partnered with two companies, Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostics Labs, to oversee the manufacturing and distribution of the tests, while his lab handled the analysis.
In the July interview with The Scientist, Brooks admitted to sometimes working 22 hours a day. “As a professional, I have never felt so much stress or pressure in my life, [but] you have a sense of purpose,” he said. “We’ve all taken it to another level because of its importance. I hope we never see anything like it in our lifetime again.”
Brooks is survived by his wife, Jil; his three daughters, Laura, Hannah, and Danielle; his mother, Phyllis; his sister, Janet Green; and a niece and nephew. The family has asked that memorial donations be made to the Rutgers University Foundation, which is establishing a new Dr. Andrew Brooks Memorial Scholarship.

hrough the social and economic disruption that COVID-19 caused in 2020, the biomedical research community rose to the challenge and accomplished unprecedented feats of scientific acumen. With a new year ahead of us, even as the pandemic grinds on, we at The Scientist thought it was an opportune time to ask what might be on the life science innovation radar for 2021 and beyond. We tapped three members of the independent judging panel that helped name our Top 10 Innovations of 2020 to share their thoughts (via email) on the year ahead.
Paul Blainey
The Scientist: If you had to pick one area of life science innovation or one technology that will make headlines in 2021, what would it be and why?
Paul Blainey: Value is shifting from the impact of individual technologies (mass spectrometry, cloning, sequencing, PCR, induced pluripotent stem cells, next generation sequencing, genome editing, etc.) to impact across technologies. In 2021, I think researchers will increasingly leverage multiple technologies together in order to generate new insights, as well as become more technology-agnostic as multiple technologies present plausible paths toward research goals.
Kim Kamdar
Kim Kamdar: Partially in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, one 2021 headline will be the continued innovation focused on consumerization of healthcare, which is redefining how consumers engage with providers across each stage of care. Consumers are even selective about their healthcare choices now, and the retail powerhouses like CVS and Walmart have and will continue to develop solutions to meet the needs of their customers. While this was already underway prior to the pandemic, the crisis has spurred on this activity with the goal of making healthcare more accessible and affordable and ultimately delivering on better health outcomes for all Americans.
Robert Meagher
Robert Meagher: I think this is easy—mRNA delivery. This is something that has been in development for years for numerous applications, but the successful development and FDA emergency use authorization of two COVID-19 vaccines based on this technology shines a very bright spotlight on this technology. The vaccine trials and now widespread use of the vaccines will give developers a lot of data about the technology, and sets a baseline for understanding safety and side effects when considering future therapeutic applications outside of infectious disease.
See “The Promise of mRNA Vaccines”
TS: Life science tools have been trending towards single-cell technology for a few years. Do you see this trend continuing, or how might it evolve?
PB: Single-cell technology is here to stay, although its use will continue to change. One analogy to be drawn is the shift we saw from the popularity of de novo genome sequencing (during the human genome project and the early part of the NGS [next-generation sequencing] era to the rich array of re-sequencing applications practiced today. I expect new ways to use single-cell technology will continue to be discovered for some time to come. 
KK: Innovation in single-cell technology has the potential to transform biological research driving to a level of resolution that provides a more nuanced picture of complex biology. Cost has been a key barrier for broader adoption of single-cell analysis. As better technology is developed, cost will be reduced and there will be an explosion in single-cell research. This dynamic will also allow for broader adoption of single-cell technology from translational research to clinical applications particularly in oncology and immunology.    
RM: Yes—there is continuing innovation in this space, and room for continued innovation. One area that we have seen development recently, and I see it continuing, is to study single cells not just in isolation, but coupled with spatial information: understanding single cells and their interactions with their neighbors. I also wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic will spur increased interest in applying single-cell techniques to problems in infectious disease, immunology, and microbiology. A lot of the existing methods for single-cell RNA analysis (for example) work well for human or mammalian cells, but don’t work for bacteria or viruses.
TS: Technologies geared towards CRISPR also seem to be in full flower. Do you see anything exciting on the horizon in this realm?
PB: The promises of CRISPR and gene editing are extraordinary. I can’t wait to see how that field continues to develop.
KK: Much of the CRISPR technology focus since it was unveiled in 2012 has been on its utility to modify genes in human cells with the goal of treating genetic disease. More recently, scientists have shown the potential of using the CRISPR gene-editing technology for treatment of viral disease (essentially a programmable anti-viral that could be used to treat diseases like HIV, HBV, SARS, etc. . . .). These findings, published in Nature Communications, showed that CRISPR can be used to eliminate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus macaque monkeys. If replicated in humans, in studies that will be initiated this year, CRISPR could be utilized to address HIV/AIDS and potentially make a major impact by moving a chronic disease to one with a functional cure.   
TS: What innovations are poised to translate into clinically relevant technologies in the coming year?
PB: New therapeutic modalities that expand the addressable set of diseases are particularly exciting. Cell-based therapies offer versatile platforms for biological engineering that leverage the power of human biology. It is also encouraging to see somatic cell genome editing technology advance toward the clinic for the treatment of serious diseases. 
The level of innovation that occurred in 2020 to combat COVID-19 will provide a more rapid, focused, and actionable reaction to future pandemics.
—Kim Kamdar, Domain Associates
RM: Besides the great success with mRNA-based vaccines that sets the stage for other clinical technologies based on mRNA delivery, the other area that is really in the spotlight this year is diagnostics. There are a lot of labs and companies, both small and large, that have some really innovative products and ideas for portable and point-of-care diagnostics. For a long time, this was often thought of in terms of a problem for the developing world, or resource-limited locations: think, for example, of diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated need for diagnostic testing on a massive scale has caused us to rethink what “resource-limited” means, and to understand the challenge posed by bottlenecks in supply chains, skilled personnel, and high-complexity laboratory facility. There has been a lot of foundational research over the past couple of decades in rapid, portable, easy-to-use diagnostics, but translating these to clinically useful products often seemed to stall, I suspect for lack of a lucrative market for such tests. But we are now starting to see FDA [emergency use authorization for] home-based tests and other novel diagnostic technologies to address needs with the COVID-19 pandemic, and I suspect that this paves the way for these technologies to start being applied to other diagnostic testing needs.  
TS: Although 2020 was a turbulent year, the life science community managed to mobilize around the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that the world has really never seen. How do you think responses to future pandemics will be similar to or different from this one?
PB: Seeing the suffering and destruction wrought by COVID-19, it is obvious that we need to be prepared with more extensive, equitable, and better-coordinated response plans going forward. While rapid vaccine development and testing were two bright spots last year, there are so many important areas that demand progress. As we learn about how important details become in a crisis—no matter how small or mundane—diagnostic technologies and the calibration of public health measures are two areas that merit major focus.
KK: The life science community response to the COVID-19 pandemic has already proven to be light-years ahead of previous responses particularly in areas such as vaccine development and diagnostics. It took more than a year to sequence the genome of the SARS virus in 2002. The COVID-19 genome was sequenced in under a month from the first case being identified. Scientists and clinicians were able to turn that initial information to multiple approved vaccines at a blazing speed. Utilizing messenger RNA (mRNA) as a new therapeutic modality for vaccine development has now been validated. Vaccine science has been forever changed. The pandemic has also focused a much-needed level of attention to diagnostics, forcing a rethink of how to increase access, affordability, and actionability of diagnostic testing. The level of innovation that occurred in 2020 to combat COVID-19 will provide a more rapid, focused, and actionable reaction to future pandemics. In addition, the elevation of a science advisor (Dr. Eric Lander) to a cabinet level position in the Biden administration bodes well for our future ability to ground in data and as President Biden himself framed, “refresh and reinvigorate our national science and technology strategy to set us on a strong course for the next 75 years, so that our children and grandchildren may inhabit a healthier, safer, more just, peaceful, and prosperous world.”
RM: One thing that really kick-started research to address COVID-19 was the early availability of the complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the ongoing timely deposition of new sequences in near–real-time as isolates were sequenced. This is in contrast to cases where deposition of large number of sequences may lag an outbreak by months or even years. I foresee the near–real-time sharing of sequence information to become the new standard. Making the virus itself widely and inexpensively available, in inactivated form, as well as well-characterized synthetic viral RNA standards and proteins also helped spur research.
A trend I’m less fond of is the rapid publication of non–peer reviewed results as preprints online. There’s a great benefit to getting new information out to the community ASAP, but unfortunately I think the rush to get preprints up in some cases results in spreading misleading information. This problem is compounded with uncritical, breathless press releases accompanying the posting of preprints, as opposed to waiting for peer-review acceptance of a manuscript to issue a press release. I think the solution may lie in journals considering innovative approaches to speeding up peer review, or a way to at least perform a basic check for rigor prior to posting a preliminary version of the manuscript. Right now the extremes are: post an unreviewed preprint, or wait months or even years with multiple rounds of peer review including extensive additional experiments to satisfy the curiosity of multiple reviewers for high impact publications. Is there a way to prevent manuscripts from being published as preprints with obvious methodological errors or errors in statistical analysis, while also enabling interesting, well-done yet not fully polished manuscripts to be available to the community?

lthough it appears to be trying its damnedest, 2021 has not yet sapped me of my hope that humanity can turn a corner and put the horrors of 2020 in our rearview mirror. As I’ve written in previous dispatches, what anchors me to this hope is science. 
ANDRZEJ KRAUZE
Since the calendar turned, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened; new, more-infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants are cropping up around the globe; vaccine rollout has been slower than anticipated; and political division has reached a fever pitch here in the US. But the steady pace of scientific discovery and development churns on. And even with so many aspects of our lives and work bearing the scars of 2020’s tumult (some wounds are indeed still fresh), we at The Scientist, as well as those in the research community we serve and like-minded members of the general public, continue to look to science, reason, and fact as the keys that will deliver us into a more peaceful existence.
One must keep in mind that I write these editorials weeks before you have the opportunity to read them. For example, I sit to write this piece in the middle of January, but you’re reading this on or after it is published on February 1. In normal times, this makes it difficult to encapsulate and comment on the zeitgeist of the current moment. These days, with things happening at such a frenetic pace, this task becomes nigh on impossible.
By contrast, there’s something downright comforting about following an enterprise that proceeds at a stable rate and that tends to build slowly, one insight adding to preceding ones to form an ever-clearer picture of reality. That’s not to say science can’t or doesn’t surprise us. To be sure, there have been many great leaps in humanity’s understanding of the world facilitated by the research enterprise. And scientists have certainly made ground-shaking discoveries throughout history. But by and large, scientific progress is made by the millimeter, not the kilometer.
Science provides the stability that the world so desperately needs right now. Revealing the truths underlying biology, chemistry, astronomy, physics, and other aspects of our universe must remain unimpeded by the turbulence that may surround us. And those truths can serve as antidotes to the misinformation that has become a regrettable constant in our modern consciousness.
Science provides the stability that the world so desperately needs right now.
While I cannot predict what might happen in the time between when I pen this editorial and when you read it, I can forecast that the quest for truth, which rests at the foundation of the human experience, will continue to propel our species forward. As long as a sufficient number of us stand up, repeatedly and consistently, to voice the importance of science and fact, we can hope that the infrastructure designed to support research efforts will continue to do so. And although I can’t be sure that the divisiveness that marks so much of our social and political discourse these days will ever be reckoned with and healed, I can’t think of a better starting point to move forward into an increasingly uncertain future than a shared respect for and trust in science.

One-Shot COVID-19 Vaccine Prevents Severe Disease/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
BLUECINEMA
J
ohnson & Johnson announced today (January 29) that its one-shot vaccine is 66 percent effective at preventing moderate and severe COVID-19 and 85 percent protective against severe disease.
“This is a really great result,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, tells The New York Times. “I hope this vaccine gets approved as soon as possible to reduce disease burden around the world.”
No one who received the shot died of COVID-19, while five individuals in the placebo group did, Reuters reports. “The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” Walid Gellad, a physician who studies health policy at the University of Pittsburgh, tells Reuters.
Although the company’s vaccine is less effective at preventing COVID-19 than Moderna’s and Pfizer’s versions are, it still surpasses the US Food and Drug Administration’s 50 percent efficacy requirement for emergency use approval. Unlike rival vaccines that are administered as two doses, Johnson’s and Johnson’s vaccine requires just a single injection.
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
The one-shot vaccine could be a “game changer,” Jonathan Temte, a vaccine expert at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, tells The Washington Post, because it could simplify vaccine distribution. In addition, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine doesn’t need to be stored in temperatures as cold as Moderna and Pfizer’s versions.
Interim results from the Phase 3 trial—which involved more than 40,000 participants in eight countries—found that vaccine performance varied across the world. In the US, it protected against moderate or severe COVID-19 72 percent of the time, but just 57 percent of the time in South Africa, where a worrying new variant of the virus—B.1.351—first emerged. Against severe COVID-19, the vaccine retained its 85 percent effectiveness against all variants tested, including B.1.351.
See “New SARS-CoV-2 Variant Could Evade Antibodies”
The vaccine “will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19. It also offers the hope of helping ease the huge burden placed on healthcare systems and communities,” says Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson’s vice chairman of the executive committee and chief scientific officer, in the announcement.
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine uses deactivated common cold viruses to deliver SARS-CoV-2 DNA, whereas Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines both use messenger RNA technology. The company says it will apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization in early February and have doses ready to ship immediately.
Side-by-Side Comparisons of Important SARS-CoV-2 Variants/-/ABOVE: Since its spillover into the human population in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into many clades and variants.
NEXTSTRAIN.ORG 
A
range of SARS-CoV-2 variants has emerged across the world since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most attention has been on fast-spreading variants recently identified in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Scientists suspect that the variants’ particular patterns of mutations have the potential to affect their transmissibility, virulence, and/or ability to evade parts of the immune system. The latter could make people with vaccine-induced or natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable to becoming reinfected with novel variants, and these possible effects remain under investigation.
See “A Guide to Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants”
There are a handful of other variants—typically with fewer eye-catching mutations—that researchers are also keeping a close watch on, notes molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft of the University of Bern in Switzerland. Making matters confusing, scientists can’t agree on a standardized naming system for new variants, causing what one researcher has called a “bloody mess” of nomenclature.
Here The Scientist compiles a summary of some noteworthy variants recently associated with rapid spread that US researchers are currently monitoring. 
Name(s) 
Distribution 
Notable mutations 
Potential effects on transmissibility, virulence, and immune escape
B.1.1.7, 20I/501Y.V1, VOC202012/01
First identified in late December in the UK, it has spread to 62 countries in Europe, Asia, the US, and elsewhere. 
17 recent mutations, including N501Y, P681H, HV 69–70 deletion, and four more on the spike protein; the ORF8 Q27stop mutation outside the spike protein
• Thought to have greater than 40 percent increased transmissibility
• Increased virulence suggested but remains unresolved 
• Little concern around current vaccine efficacy
B.1.351, 20C/501Y.V2
Identified in late December in South Africa and now spotted in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia
21 mutations, including N501Y, E484K, and K417N on the spike protein, and ORF1b deletion outside the spike protein 
• Suggested to have heightened transmissibility
• No evidence of increased virulence 
• In vitro studies suggest a potential for immune escape following natural infections and a small effect on the potency of vaccine-induced antibodies
P.1, 20J/501Y.V3
Discovered in travelers from Brazil during screening at a Japanese airport in January; now known to widely circulate in Brazil’s Amazonas state and also observed in the Faroe Islands, South Korea, and the US
17 amino acid changes, including N501Y, E484K, and K417N on the spike protein; ORF1b deletion outside the spike protein 
• Effect on transmissibility and/or virulence unknown
• Anecdotes of reinfections reported, but potential for immune evasion remains unresolved
COH.20G/501Y
Two cases of the N501Y mutation have been detected in Columbus, Ohio, since late December, and in other US states since
N501Y, located in the virus’s spike protein. It lacks most other mutations present in the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the UK.
• No evidence yet of altered transmissibility, virulence, and/or immune evasion
S Q677H, sometimes called “Midwest” variant
Viruses containing the S Q677H mutation have recently become frequent in samples analyzed during December and January in Ohio, and have also been found in multiple Midwest states
Q677H mutation on the spike protein, A85S on the M protein, and D377Y on the nucleocapsid protein
• So far, no evidence of altered transmissibility, virulence, and/or immune evasion
L452R, B1429
The L452R mutation itself was observed in the US and Europe last year. In January 2021, it rose rapidly in frequency in multiple California counties.
L452R mutation, located on the spike protein
• Associated with several large outbreaks in California, but it remains unclear if the surges are driven by the variant itself
• Effects on vaccine efficacy under investigation

ARS-CoV-2 is no Ferrari among viruses when it comes to mutations. Scientists reckon that its 30,000-base RNA genome acquires around two single-letter mutations a month, a rate around half as fast as influenza and one-quarter the rate of HIV. But allowed to multiply and jump from body to body for more than a year, SARS-CoV-2 has inevitably flourished into a genetically diverse tree branching into countless different variants.
Many variants—defined by a specific assortment of mutations—are relatively unremarkable. But scientists have been keeping a close watch on three rapidly spreading variants—first identified in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil—which harbor an unusual constellation of mutations. They all share a mutation called N501Y that affects the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which the virus uses to clasp onto human cells’ receptors and enter them. That mutation replaces SARS-CoV-2’s 501st amino acid, asparagine, with tyrosine, potentially allowing it to bind more tightly to ACE2 receptors, studies in cells and animal models suggest.
By itself, that mutation isn’t unusual, but the variants possess an exceptionally large number of other mutations, some also on the spike protein. Substantive changes to a virus’ behavior, such as heightened transmissibility, are likely the result of multiple mutations rather than individual ones, molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft of the University of Bern tells The Atlantic.

The observation that similar mutations have appeared in three independent variants, and the fact that they are spreading, makes scientists suspect that they may have an evolutionary edge.
“They have multiple, eight to ten, mutations in the spike protein all stacked up at once—that suggests that there [is] a lot of evolution and adaption of the protein happening,” Daniel Jones, a molecular pathologist at the Ohio State University, tells The Scientist. “The concern being that since that’s the target of vaccinations and . . . the target for antibody [therapies] like the Regeneron cocktail, for instance, that it might be the beginning of a virus that could evade antibody therapy and/or vaccine coverage.”
SARS-CoV-2 mutations’ effects on transmissibility
It’s often in a virus’ interest to become more transmissible so it can spread and replicate more quickly. Earlier in the pandemic, a spike protein mutation known as D614G—which is widely believed to have made the virus more transmissible—surged to dominance around the world, notes virologist John Moore of Weill Cornell Medical College.
Epidemiological data suggest that the B.1.1.7 variant, a descendant of the D614G lineage first identified in the UK that has spread to other parts of the world, also has heightened transmissibility. Eight of the 17 mutations it has recently accumulated are in the spike protein, which could feasibly have an effect on ACE2 binding and virus replication. Hypothetically, if a virus can bind more tightly to the body’s ACE2 receptors, it could be more capable of establishing an infection once it gets into the body and/or of generating more viral particles in the upper respiratory tract, making it easier to transmit to other people, particularly during the presymptomatic stage, explains Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York.
She adds that in her view, it’s hard to definitively ascribe case surges, including the current one in the UK, to single factors such as increased transmissibility, over other driving factors, such as what she sees as ineffective lockdown policies. “I’m not saying that [increased] transmissibility is out of the question. I’m just saying it’s extremely hard to prove.”
In South Africa, epidemiologists have estimated that the new variant there, B.1.351 (also known as 501Y.V2), is around 50 percent more contagious compared with dominant lineages, based on its rapid spread, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In Brazil, it’s too early to conclude whether a variant now circulating there, called P.1, is inherently more transmissible. First reported on January 12 in the state of Amazonas, it’s been associated with a devastating surge in cases in Manaus, a city where researchers had previously estimated that 75 percent of residents had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. But it’s still unclear whether properties of the virus itself are contributing to the surge, says virologist Paola Resende of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro. “In Brazil, we can see a lot of parties, we can see the pubs crowded, and people are on the streets not wearing masks. I think this behavior of the population is the main reason [for] the increase.”

Evading the immune system
Our immune system—and, in particular, antibodies—is a powerful evolutionary force on viruses. Some pathogens such as influenza, and maybe also common cold-causing coronaviruses, mutate their proteins toward new shapes to avoid being targeted by antibodies that would normally prevent them from infecting cells, a process known as antigenic drift. A study recently posted as a preprint to bioRxiv by Hatziioannou and her colleagues suggests that the RBD mutations present in the B.1.351 variant are due to antigenic drift. The team passaged a model virus bearing the dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the presence of individual neutralizing antibodies extracted from people who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Depending on which antibody they were cultured with, the viruses would gradually adopt a single mutation—either E484K, K417N, and N501Y—which are present in B.1.351. That suggests that “the virus is mutating in these positions to avoid antibodies,” Hatziioannou says.
Such antibody-escape mutations don’t necessarily mean that the virus will cause more severe disease or entirely outwit the immune response, she cautions. There are other parts of the immune system to help clear the virus. There’s no evidence so far to suggest that the variants identified in South Africa or Brazil are more lethal. Based on an analysis of several datasets, scientists in the UK suggested last week there’s a “realistic possibility” that B.1.1.7 is deadlier than previous strains, but experts say it’s still too early to draw that conclusion. Another concern is about whether people who have overcome mild infections with older variants could become reinfected with a new one.
Nobody that I know has been losing a moment of sleep over the UK variant from a vaccine-efficacy perspective.
—John Moore, Weill Cornell Medical College
In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study, scientists in South Africa investigated that possibility by testing the potency of antibodies from 44 COVID-19 survivors against the B.1.351 variant. Remarkably, serum samples from 21 patients were not capable of neutralizing the virus in vitro. Antibodies from hospitalized patients with more severe disease were more effective against the virus compared to those who had only mild symptoms. “These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants,” the authors reported.
There’s less information on the P.1 variant, which health officials in Minnesota reported January 25 has been detected there, marking the first observation in the US. Because its mutation pattern is similar to B.1.351—namely, it shares the E484K and K417N RBD mutations—“there would be reasons to believe that what applies for one would likely apply to the other,” Moore notes.
Resende and her colleagues have recently documented two cases when people became reinfected with a new variant. In one, the reinfection was caused by P.1. The other incident of reinfection was caused by P.2, a closely watched emergent sister variant that carries fewer changes overall but harbors the N501Y and E484K mutations. Given that reinfections are known to occur with SARS-CoV-2, albeit rarely, such anecdotal observations don’t tell researchers if it’s more likely to happen with the new variants. Nevertheless, “all mutations located in the receptor binding domain, we need to pay attention to,” Resende says.
Implications for vaccine efficacy
Such escape mutations in the RBD—a site most vaccines are targeting—don’t bode well for vaccinated individuals, who could theoretically be vulnerable to infection by a new variant. While mRNA vaccines, such as the ones developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are relatively straightforward to update, the processes of seeking regulatory approvals and producing a new vaccine aren’t trivial, Moore notes.
See “The Promise of mRNA Vaccines”
Antigenic escape is not much of a concern with B.1.1.7, “because the location of the mutation suggested that it wouldn’t be an escape mutation,” Moore says. “Nobody that I know has been losing a moment of sleep over the UK variant from a vaccine-efficacy perspective.” Indeed, Pfizer and BioNTech recently reported preliminary data suggesting that their mRNA vaccine is just as effective against B.1.1.7 as it is against the variant that originated in Wuhan.
Researchers are still investigating the effect of the P.1 variant’s vulnerability to vaccines in Brazil, Resende says. As for the B.1.351 variant, a second experiment in Hatziioannou’s study provides some insights. She and her colleagues examined antibody-containing plasma from 20 people who had either received the Moderna or the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The team tested the plasma against the dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and pseudoviruses engineered to have the variant’s RBD mutations, either individually or in combination. The antibodies proved significantly less effective in neutralizing the pseudoviruses compared to pseudoviruses with the original spike protein, with a one- to threefold decrease in antibody potency. “It’s a really small difference,” she says, adding that it’s not entirely clear why the South African team—testing antibodies from survivors of natural infections against the actual RBD protein—observed a more dramatic drop in antibody potency.
This week, Moderna reported preliminary results from a separate in vitro examination of sera from eight people who had received two doses of the company’s vaccine. According to a press release, company scientists observed a reduction in antibody potency with the B.1.351 variant compared to prior variants, but the level of neutralizing antibodies “remain above levels that are expected to be protective.” The B.1.1.7 variant had no impact on antibody potency.
“There are grounds for concern [with vaccines], but the sky isn’t falling,” Moore says. Some researchers have pointed out that in addition to antibodies, there are other components of immune memory, which could prevent severe reinfections with novel variants. And because the vaccines—at least the ones examined in the study—are so effective, “even if antibody effectiveness were reduced tenfold, the vaccines would still be quite effective against the virus,” evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle tells The New York Times.
Hatziioannou anticipates that if variants are left to spread for longer and accumulate many more mutations, vaccine manufacturers may have to update their vaccines at some point, as is done with annual flu shots. For now, “I think the vaccine will still work,” she says. “But this is the first step: it’s a little bit of resistance, and then [with] the next set of mutations a little bit more, and the next set of mutations a little bit more, until eventually we get to something that’s significantly more resistant.”
Meanwhile, new variants are on the horizon. This month, Jones and his colleagues discovered a novel variant in Columbus, Ohio, that lacks the complexity of mutations of the major three variants, but possesses the N501Y sequence. “It’s really this November, December timeframe, where we’ve seen all of these alternate viruses with the N501Y mutation go from low levels in the population to a very significant percentage,” he says. The COH.20G/501Y variant from Ohio has since also been found elsewhere in the US, but its rate of spread is hard to determine.
A second mutation that has popped up frequently in Jones’s recent samples and in other Midwestern states is located outside the spike (S) RBD. “It’s in a conserved area that regulates the cleavage of the S protein, [which] has also raised the possibility that this could be a functional change in the virus.”
L452R, a different mutation that appears to be spreading, was recently associated with large outbreaks in California, but experts say it’s not clear if it’s more infectious.
Variants are a numbers game, Moore says: give a virus more bodies and more time to spread, and novel variants are certain to emerge. The good news, Resende points out, is that all variants—be they existing or future ones—can in principle be controlled with the same measures: “washing our hands, wearing masks, avoiding crowded places.”
Side-by-Side Comparisons of Important SARS-CoV-2 Variants
A range of SARS-CoV-2 variants has emerged across the world since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most attention has been on fast-spreading variants recently identified in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Scientists suspect that the variants’ particular patterns of mutations have the potential to affect their transmissibility, virulence, and/or ability to evade parts of the immune system. The latter could make people with vaccine-induced or natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable to becoming reinfected with novel variants, and these possible effects remain under investigation.
There are a handful of other variants—typically with fewer eye-catching mutations—that researchers are also keeping a close watch on, notes molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft of the University of Bern in Switzerland. Making matters confusing, scientists can’t agree on a standardized naming system for new variants, causing what one researcher has called a “bloody mess” of nomenclature.
Here The Scientist compiles a summary of some noteworthy variants recently associated with rapid spread that US researchers are currently monitoring.

SARS-CoV-2 Isn’t Going Away, Experts Predict/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JORDANSIMEONOV
N
ever one to use two words when six will do, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reached for a range of verbal contortions to predict an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.
He’s used the 1815 battle of Waterloo—“the morale-boosting bugle-blasting excitement of Wellington’s Prussian allies coming through the woods”—to describe vaccinations, and warned against the premature lifting of restrictions by invoking Steve McQueen’s fate in the 1960s movie The Great Escape: “if we try to jump the fence now, we will simply tangle ourselves in the last barbed wire.”
Despite the verbose promises of victory as vaccine programs around the world accelerate, the pandemic is unlikely to end with the knock-out blow against the virus that Johnson and other political leaders promise. The best we can hope for, scientists predict, is an uneasy truce.
I don’t think that anyone who is reasonably well-informed about infectious diseases and how they move in populations thinks we are going to eradicate COVID.
—Kate Baker, University of Liverpool 
“The chances of this disease going away are very small,” says Kate Baker, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Liverpool in the UK. “I think we’re going to end up tolerating a certain level of disease.”
In simple terms, the future of COVID-19 comes down to one of two possible paths. Either we eradicate the virus, or we don’t. And if we don’t, then the disease will become endemic, Baker says. Future generations will share their world with SARS-CoV-2 with the same weary familiarity as we do already with germs that cause everything from influenza to measles to the common cold.
“I don’t think that anyone who is reasonably well-informed about infectious diseases and how they move in populations thinks we are going to eradicate COVID,” Baker says.
The world has managed to stamp out viral diseases before, including the original SARS outbreak that killed hundreds when it swept through southeast Asia in 2002–’03. That virus spread from people who already showed symptoms, which made it relatively easy to prevent onward transmission by quarantining those who were sick. In contrast, people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are unknowingly contagious for several days before they become ill, if they ever do.
Given such asymptomatic transmission, the only way to eradicate COVID-19 would be through a sustained global vaccination program, says Graham Medley, an infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who is helping to advise the UK government. This was done with smallpox in the 1970s and has almost been achieved with polio today, with the disease remaining endemic in just Afghanistan and Pakistan.
For these viruses, vaccines are available to provide so-called sterilizing immunity. The immune response generated by the vaccines is so effective it stops people becoming ill and stops them from passing on the disease to others. Although COVID-19 vaccines reduce the severity of symptoms, there is little evidence they block transmission, and experts tell The Scientist they think it is unlikely.
“My bet is against that. Not anything against the vaccines, but it doesn’t seem like that’s how our immunity to coronaviruses typically works,” says Jennie Lavine, a biologist at Emory University in Atlanta.
Even if there were a COVID-19 vaccine that introduced sterilizing immunity, and enough people could be persuaded to take it, eradication is far from guaranteed. Such an effort would take years and would be hugely expensive, particularly as populations would need booster jabs periodically to protect them from possible flare-ups.
“We would have to keep vaccinating if it existed anywhere else in the world,” says Medley. “Eradication requires a large global coordination, which is just not there at the moment. We have a vaccine that works but we don’t have the political, social, and economic structure to distribute it equally around the world.”
For these reasons, experts expect that COVID-19 will become endemic, a term epidemiologists reserve for when disease spread settles at a relatively stable baseline level—in other words, the phase after a rapidly growing epidemic.
The endemic future of COVID-19
An epidemic slows to make a disease endemic as the number of available susceptible hosts drops over time, so that each infected individual passes the disease to just one other person on average. Without vaccines, this steady state emerges only when large numbers of people are infected and then either die or gain immunity. By safely offering immune protection, vaccinations against COVID-19 will speed this transition to endemicity, and massively reduce the death toll along the way.
Exactly how the disease will show itself once it becomes endemic is unclear, Lavine says. A modelling study she published earlier this month in Science suggests it will pose a similar threat to existing common-cold viruses. Catching the SARS-CoV-2 virus once or twice in childhood, the study concluded, should then prevent people from getting severe disease from it later in life. “We don’t know the answer to that yet because we haven’t had enough time. But from data on other coronaviruses that seems extremely likely,” she says.
Key to this prediction is that COVID-19 continues to trigger mild or no symptoms in children when they are exposed to the virus for the first time. Such childhood exposure can then be tolerated by society because it grants lasting immune protection, topped up by regular re-exposure to the circulating virus.
The world has probably been here before. The four coronaviruses identified as responsible for many common colds are thought to have been far more dangerous when they first emerged as human diseases. “Some of these we think were the basis for what people at the time called flu epidemics or pandemics,” says Marc Veldhoen, an immunologist at Lisbon University in Portugal.
Studies suggest that the so-called Russian flu that killed 1 million people in 1890 may have been caused by the human coronavirus OC43, Veldhoen says. “And now it’s endemic.” The end of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, he says, may only be the start of our relationship with this virus.
Moderna Developing Booster Shot for New Virus Variant B.1.351/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

oderna announced today (January 25) plans for testing two different booster vaccines aimed at the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351, also known as 501Y.V2, that emerged in South Africa and has now spread to numerous countries.
See “New SARS-CoV-2 Variant Could Evade Antibodies”
“The virus is changing its stripes, and we will change to make sure we can beat the virus where it’s going,” Stephen Hoge, the president of Moderna, tells The Washington Post.
A study from Moderna posted to the preprint server bioRxiv today that has not yet been peer-reviewed reports that its vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 and B.1.1.7, the latter of which was first spotted in the UK and is rapidly becoming common in other countries. But antibody levels produced in response to B.1.351 were about six times lower than prior variants. Moderna’s statement says that these antibody titers “remain above levels that are expected to be protective,” but warns that “these lower titers may suggest a potential risk of earlier waning of immunity to the new B.1.351 strains.”
See “Data Hint B.1.1.7 Could Be More Deadly Than Thought”
The Moderna vaccine is currently administered as two doses spaced a month apart. According to the statement, the company will test whether a third shot of the current vaccine or a strain-specific booster shot will enhance immunity to B.1.351.
“Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic to determine if it will be more effective to boost titers against this and potentially future variants,” says Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive officer of Moderna, in the statement. 
B.1.351, first detected in South Africa in October 2020, is one of a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This one is distinct from the highly transmissible B.1.1.7, although both versions have multiple mutations on the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that B.1.135 causes more severe disease than other variants do.
Data Hint B.1.1.7 Could Be More Deadly Than Thought/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LAURENCE BERGER
Update (March 10): One of the studies included in the NERVTAG report has been published in The BMJ today with expanded data. The researchers compared more than 100,000 people who tested positive for either B.1.1.7 or other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and found that B.1.1.7 was associated with a 32–104 percent increased risk of death within 28 days.
T
he B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first found in September and is now dominant in the UK and present in many other countries, is thought to be more easily transmitted than other variants are. It might also be more deadly. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at a news conference on Friday (January 22) that new data indicate B.1.1.7 may be 30 percent more fatal.
The evidence comes from two analyses reviewed by a government committee called the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats, or NERVTAG. Patrick Vallance, Johnson’s chief scientific adviser, said at the news conference that the 30 percent would mean that, for example, where before about 10 of every 1,000 60-year-olds who contracted COVID-19 would die, the rate for those with a B.1.1.7 infection would go up to 13 or 14 deaths per 1,000 cases. He urged caution in interpreting the numbers, saying in remarks quoted by USA Today, “I want to stress there’s a lot of uncertainty around these numbers and we need more work to get a precise handle on it, but it obviously is a concern that this (variant) has an increase in mortality as well as an increase in transmissibility.”
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast earlier this month that B.1.1.7 will become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the country in March. “Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission might threaten strained health care resources, require extended and more rigorous implementation of public health strategies, and increase the percentage of population immunity required for pandemic control,” the agency warned.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead on COVID-19, tells the Associated Press that the contagiousness and deadliness of new variants are being studied, and that so far her team hasn’t observed that they are more likely to cause severe disease, but that more-transmissible variants could lead to overwhelmed healthcare systems and thus, indirectly, to more deaths.
Luciana Borio, a COVID-19 advisor to President Joe Biden’s administration, makes a similar suggestion in comments to USA Today. “At minimum, I’d like to see data that this virus is causing some higher viral loads or some kind of mechanism that could explain the direct impact,” she says. “We don’t have any evidence that it’s a biological phenomenon.”
Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki tells the newspaper that the news makes measures such as wearing a mask, avoiding crowds indoors, and getting vaccinated even more important.
“Honestly, the more you can avoid interaction altogether, the better,” she says. “Obviously some people don't have that luxury.”

New SARS-CoV-2 Variant Could Evade Antibodies/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HOCUS-FOCUS
I
n recent months, as the global COVID-19 pandemic rages on, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have sparked concerns about whether existing vaccines will perform as well against the evolving virus as they did in clinical trials. Three preprints posted on bioRxiv on January 19 shed some light on this question, finding that serum from vaccinated people was able to neutralize a virus with some of the same mutations as one now-widespread variant, B.1.1.7, but was less effective in neutralizing strains mimicking another variant known as 501Y.V2.
One study investigated the effects of the 501Y.V2 variant that emerged in South Africa, using serum samples from 44 people who had had COVID-19. When these sera were exposed to the variant, which has multiple mutations in its spike protein, 48 percent were unable to neutralize the virus.
“The data do raise the possibility that the protection gained from past infection with COVID-19 may be lower for re-infection with the South African variant,” Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the study, tells Reuters. “The data also suggest that the existing vaccines could be less effective against the South African variant.”
In another study, serum samples from 16 people who had received the Pfizer vaccine were exposed to a virus with 10 mutations found in the spike protein of B.1.1.7, often called the UK variant. The synthesized pseudovirus was easily neutralized by antibodies in the samples, keeping hopes about vaccine efficacy high for this variant.
The third study used serum samples from 20 people who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to explore how vaccine-induced immunity stood up to specific mutations that affect the spike protein. Although antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wane as time goes on following infection, B cells retain the ability to target spike proteins and receptor binding domains which is part of the spike that allows the virus to attach to cells for infection. The efficacy of the serum was diminished against the pseudoviruses carrying the mutations compared with those with the dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the samples neutralized the viral threat with a one- to threefold increase in antibodies. However, the small pool of samples lacks diversity in age and race, which are two crucial factors in COVID-19 outcomes, Drew Weissman, an infectious disease expert who worked on vaccine development, tells the Associated Press.
According to biologist James Naismith of Oxford University, who was not involved in the study, neutralization isn’t the only marker to measure a successful immune response.
“The real world human immune response is more than serum-based neutralisation,” Naismith tells The Guardian. “Of course we would rather neutralisation had occurred but this does not mean that the new virus will infect, make ill and spread from those who have already been infected with the original strain.”
Although the data do suggest that the vaccines might not confer the same level of protection as has been seen in clinical trials, they are still highly effective, immunologist E. John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research explains to the Associated Press. “We don’t want people thinking that the current vaccine is already outdated. That’s absolutely not true,” he explains. “There’s still immunity here . . . a good level of protection.” 
Still, vaccinologist Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic who was not part of the studies, tells the AP that relying solely on vaccines to curb the spread of COVID-19 is a fool’s errand and that more needs to be done at the most basic level, like socially distancing and wearing masks. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot by allowing unmitigated transmission of this virus,” he says. 
Correction (January 22): A previous version of the article misstated that the individuals in the first study mentioned had been vaccinated, as well as the nature of the variant used in testing. We also moved Drew Weissman’s quote to be adjacent to the study he was commenting on. The Scientist regrets the errors.

ore than a year has elapsed since the first recorded cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and scientists still aren’t sure from which animal it spilled over into human populations, and they may never find out. Had researchers archived more host vouchers, which are preserved specimens or tissues of species that carry pathogens, investigators may have had a better chance at pinpointing the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 quickly, argues a group of scientists in mBio on January 12. 
The authors call on field scientists who study infectious diseases in animals to partner with museums to store specimens whenever possible, rather than remain siloed in their separate pursuits.
See “Which Species Transmit COVID-19 to Humans? We’re Still Not Sure.”
The Scientist spoke with coauthors Cody Thompson, the mammal collections manager and a researcher at the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan, and Kendra Phelps, a senior scientist at EcoHealth Alliance who researches pathogen persistence and transmission in bat hosts, to hear more about the role that natural history museums can play in helping researchers in pandemic surveillance.

Cody Thompson: Vouchering is the process of coming up with an archive specimen or sample. As it relates to animal specimens, this would be an animal that may have been euthanized in the process of sampling for, say, viral surveillance or accidental death. Or it could be the samples that are associated with that process of surveillance—blood, tissue, or wing punches, for example—that result in the animal being released but there’s still some material available that can be stored in a way that can be used by other scientists. 
TS: And why would this be a useful tool in the context of COVID-19?
Kendra Phelps: We’re facing another coronavirus causing a global health emergency—the third one in two decades. We know from past outbreaks that [these coronaviruses] likely originated from bats, so having a suite of species archived or vouchered in a museum would be useful for determining what is the original reservoir host and then going from there to figure out how it got into humans.
The two fields of museum science and disease surveillance have not been well-integrated. You have virologists, and research scientists, and disease ecologists interested in what viruses could potentially be pathogenic to humans, but then they’re not keeping a record of the hosts, which ultimately is critical for preventing pandemics or mitigating the spread of a pandemic. If we know the reservoir host, that can give us a lot of information. Especially with new technology over time, we can look at different host-pathogen dynamics. Taxonomy changes constantly, so having a permanent record preserved at a museum that’s accessible to the research community is critical for understanding pandemics, especially those of zoonotic origin. 
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
TS: How would you recommend bolstering collaboration between museum curators and researchers?
KP: Being aware that the two fields exist. I come from a background of ecology. I have museum experience, and I now conduct disease surveillance of bats and coronaviruses, specifically. I work with people who have the same interest in understanding the catalog of potentially pathogenic viruses that are out there and mitigating the spread to humans, but I think little thought has been given to the host. . . . 
It’s just a lack of crosstalk and collaboration between [museum curators and researchers]. And not for any ill reason—it’s just people are in their circles. That’s one thing the pandemic has taught us: we can’t operate in a single bubble of research—we have to expand to a broader [global health] understanding. 
See “Why Bats Make Such Good Viral Hosts”
CT: Museums, we consider ourselves the libraries of life. But too often there’s this perception that our focus is purely on systematics and taxonomy and doesn’t extend beyond that. Of course, that’s not true, and the breadth of the type of things that museum scientists do is definitely expanding as technology expands and increases our ability to do different things with the specimens that have been collected or will be collected in the future. . . . 
If we are to be the libraries of life, we need to think more broadly and think at those levels of the very small things that we typically don’t think about as living in a museum cabinet: looking at tissue samples and microbiological samples as part of our mission to expand our capabilities of supporting that broad work that biologists and microbiologists do.
TS: You talk about a specific case in 1993 in which vouchering helped solve the mystery of a viral outbreak. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
CT: This particular story focuses on hantaviruses in the Four Corners region of the US. Hantaviruses have been expanding into more northern latitudes: they’re now found in much of the US, but at the time, they were relatively unknown to the [US]. That outbreak led to the hospitalization and ultimately the death of several individuals [and] was really a mystery as to where it originated from. 
It’s important when you’re initiating a study that you begin a collaboration with a natural history museum so that they’re prepared for what you’re collecting and can assure that they can house these specimens.
—Kendra Phelps, EcoHealth Alliance
There was a large state and federal response from public health agencies, and ultimately the research came back to the collections at the Museum of Southwestern Biology. Through the efforts of previous researchers that had collected specimens in the area and archived not only the specimens, but also the corresponding tissue samples for those animals, they were able to go back and screen tissue to determine whether or not there was virus that existed in those animals.
They were able to determine that was indeed the case. They connected hantavirus to one of the most common species of mouse that’s found in North America, which really became a groundbreaking change in the way that museums could be leveraged, but also that combination of field ecology and field biology with the public health setting. It really has changed the perception of how those entities can work together. 
TS: Wow, that’s quite the story. How do you envision this kind of collaboration would look like in practice?
KP: I do the actual boots-on-the-ground disease surveillance. I’ve focused largely on bats for the last 20 years. How we can integrate that is, we can continue to sample wildlife but also sacrifice a few individuals of each species that we’re sampling and make sure that they’re deposited in a natural history museum that can archive them for long-term. It doesn’t always have to be targeted lethal sampling, but with any research on wildlife, you can have accidental trap deaths. Just taking advantage of that opportunistic specimen right there, rather than waste and dispose it as biohazard, prepare it as a museum voucher specimen.
Also, it’s important when you’re initiating a study that you begin a collaboration with a natural history museum so that they’re prepared for what you’re collecting and can assure that they can house these specimens. 
CT: There’s also a large amount of casual surveillance that occurs at the local and state health department levels. For example, rabies submissions are a very common thing in most US states, and those are screened oftentimes at the state level. It involves potentially thousands of bats, carnivores, and other animals that maybe were considered to be in close contact with individuals. As we know rabies is relatively low in populations, and ultimately a lot of those animals are incinerated. That’s a missed opportunity that could be an easy connection between museum collections and the public health community. It could be beneficial for screening for other pathogens in the future, but also, helping address things like the biodiversity crisis and climate change that we’re all involved with at some level.

COVID-19’s Effects on the Brain/-/ABOVE: Slice of a deceased COVID-19 patient’s olfactory bulb, illustrating an area (left) with significant leakage of fibrinogen (fluorescent green) into the tissue, likely the result of damage to small blood vessels.

hen epidemics and pandemics washed over humanity through the ages, watchful doctors noticed that in addition to the usual, mostly respiratory ailments, the illnesses also seemed to trigger neurological symptoms. One British throat specialist observed in the late 1800s that influenza appeared to “run up and down the nervous keyboard stirring up disorder and pain in different parts of the body with what almost seems malicious caprice.” Indeed, some patients during the 1889–92 influenza pandemic reportedly became afflicted with psychoses, paranoia, stabbing pains, and nerve damage. Similarly, scholars have linked the 1918 flu pandemic to parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric disorders, and a broadly coinciding outbreak of the “sleeping sickness” encephalitis lethargica, which would often arrest patients in a coma-like state—although researchers still debate whether the two are causally connected.
That SARS-CoV-2, the culprit of the COVID-19 pandemic, is also associated with neurological symptoms isn’t entirely surprising, given some evidence that its close relatives, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1, have been associated with neurological symptoms too. But the proportion of patients developing such symptoms—and their mounting collective numbers—has startled some scientists. When the news broke early last year that some 36 percent of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan hospitals were developing impaired consciousness, seizures, sensory impairments, and other neurological symptoms, “that floored me,” remarks Shibani Mukerji, a neuroinfectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Autopsy studies have revealed a range of recurrent neuropathological features in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Now, entire clinics are being created specializing in subsets of patients with neurological symptoms, including one in London co-led by Patricia McNamara, a neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. She broadly separates neurological symptoms into two diverse groups. The first—described in several reports last year—comprises acute symptoms often afflicting hospitalized patients with severe disease. These can manifest as a confused, delirious state known as encephalopathy, or as strokes, peripheral nerve damage, or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. The second group represents long-term symptoms usually following milder infections, ranging from headaches, fatigue, sensations of numbness or tingling, and cognitive difficulties to occasionally seizures and inflammation of the heart, McNamara says. “The people I’ve seen so far [in this group] are people who slowly improve, but it’s certainly a very slow improvement.”
See “Could COVID-19 Trigger Chronic Disease in Some People?”
As this cohort grows, so too does the global effort to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 causes such symptoms. The picture so far remains somewhat puzzling. Autopsy studies—which have been limited—have found clear signs of damage in dozens of brains of COVID-19 patients. Although traces of the virus have been reported in some brain specimens, in many cases it is nowhere to be found. While the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the brain remains unresolved, researchers are exploring other mechanisms whereby it could affect the human brain.
“I think all of us probably . . . would agree that there is no overwhelming infection of the brain,” notes Avindra Nath, a neurovirologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “If there is, it’s a very, very miniscule amount. That cannot explain the pathology that we see. It has to be something more than that.”
Does SARS-CoV-2 infect the human brain?

Early in the pandemic, some researchers worried that SARS-CoV-2 could be gaining access to the brain and represent a “neurotropic” virus, McNamara says. That would offer an obvious hypothesis for some of the neurological symptoms observed, while also posing complex questions around how to therapeutically target pathological processes in the brain. And after all, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been spotted inside human brains, and even common cold-causing coronavirus proteins are—curiously, given that they rarely lead to neurological symptoms—common in autopsied brains, adds Helena Radbruch, a neuropathologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin.
Yet the first brain autopsies of COVID-19 patients didn’t find much SARS-CoV-2 RNA, let alone viral protein. In a September study of 18 COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms who died in hospitals last April, Mukerji and her colleagues found very low levels of RNA—the source of which is a mystery—in only five of the patient brains, and no signs of viral protein. Because the low RNA concentration “seems out of proportion to the profound deficits that people are experiencing,” she says, “I’d be extremely surprised [if] the majority of cases where people are having neurological symptoms are due to direct viral invasion.”
By the time COVID-19 patients die, most virus in the lung has often already been cleared, and that might be the case for the brain too.
In a more recent postmortem analysis of 18 patients published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Nath and his colleagues couldn’t find any evidence of the virus in the brain. However, an earlier study from researchers in Germany reported viral protein in the cranial nerves and isolated brainstem cells in 21 of 40 patients examined postmortem. Viral protein that has somehow reached the central nervous system typically elicits an immune response, Mukerji notes, but its presence in the German study didn’t correlate with the severity of neural inflammation the team observed.
Whatever viral protein is doing inside the brain, Radbruch and her colleagues assert that it is indeed finding its way there. In an autopsy study published in November in Nature Neuroscience, they propose that the virus could get into the brainstem through the nose. Based on detailed autopsy analyses from 33 COVID-19 patients, they discovered intact coronavirus particles in supporting cells of the olfactory mucosa at the roof of the nose, along with evidence of active replication in the tissue. Perhaps viral replication destroys those cells, and/or induces inflammation, which could help explain the frequent loss of taste and smell at the start of SARS-CoV-2 infections, notes Charité neuropathologist Frank Heppner, a coauthor of the study. The virus could then work its way into the olfactory bulb, a hub for processing sensory information, and via specific cranial nerves into the brain. Indeed, they observed evidence of viral RNA in these tissues as well as viral RNA and protein inside cells in the medulla oblongata in the brainstem, and in other structures such as the cerebellum, hinting that the virus could be using multiple routes of entry into the brain.
Nevertheless, Radbruch and Heppner agree that the extent of SARS-CoV-2’s infection pales in comparison to that of fellow RNA viruses such as rabies, which is devoted to infecting brain tissue. SARS-CoV-2 is more of an “incidentally neurotropic” virus, likely getting into the brain by accident, Heppner says. Notably, in the brainstem they only found viral protein inside endothelial cells that make up the lining of blood vessels—the blood-brain barrier—and not inside neurons. That could be due to difficulties detecting the virus inside neurons, or could indicate that it doesn’t infect neurons. In contrast to endothelial cells, which have an abundance of ACE2, the molecular doorways SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells, neurons tend not to have ACE2 receptors.
Still, the jury’s still out on whether SARS-CoV-2 infects the brain, notes Eric Song, an immunobiologist at Yale University who recently completed his PhD in immunologist Akiko Iwasaki’s lab there. He points to their recently published study on brain organoid models, which suggests that it’s possible for SARS-CoV-2 to infect and exert pathological effects in neural tissue. Plus, postmortem samples are limited in number, only show the final picture of a disease, and, by necessity, reflect what happens in just the sickest patients. By the time COVID-19 patients die, most virus in the lung has often already been cleared, and that might be the case for the brain too, Song says.
In a recent preprint, he and his colleagues couldn’t find viral RNA in the brain-engulfing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of six living COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. But interestingly, they did find B cells and antibodies in the CSF, and not just ones that target SARS-CoV-2, but also ones that target the body’s own proteins, including components of neurons. What this finding means is unclear, but it adds to a string of findings of body-attacking immune machinery in COVID-19. The looming question now, Song says, “is whether this is an enriched process in [COVID-19] or if it’s a process that occurs with the same magnitude in other viral diseases.”

MYOUNG-HWA LEE ET AL.  
While the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 inside human brains remains murky, autopsy studies have revealed a range of recurrent neuropathological features in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pathologists have frequently found localized hypoxic damage caused by a lack of oxygen and associated infarcts (or ischemic strokes), and less commonly, signs of bleeding in the brain, as well as some inflammation—in some cases a severe inflammation known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. What exactly causes these pathologies is unclear, but scientists have some suspicions about contributing factors.
For instance, blood clots—which COVID-19 patients are prone to develop—could create blockages that restrict blood supply to neural tissue, explaining the observed “mini strokes,” Song says. The difficulty in getting enough oxygen through damaged lungs probably also makes patients more vulnerable to hypoxic brain damage. Systemic hypoxia, in turn, could result in neurological symptoms, but in general, it’s hard to say how pathologies discovered in autopsies are connected to clinical symptoms observed in patients, Mukerji adds in an email, as neurological exams aren’t often conducted when patients are hospitalized.
See “The Specter of Endothelial Injury in COVID-19”
The immune response to the virus could also explain some neurological complications. Perhaps the exuberant flush of proinflammatory cytokines in the body’s periphery could “cause inflammatory cytokines within the brain to be more active and cause inflammation [there],” McNamara suggests. Interestingly, the Charité neuropathologists’ recent paper also found signs of inflammation and hordes of highly activated microglial cells—brain-resident immunological defenders—that could feasibly be the result of a local or peripheral immune overactivation, Heppner hypothesizes. In turn, this could perturb neuronal function, and help explain certain COVID-19 encephalopathy symptoms, such as agitation, confusion, excessive sleepiness, and comas. Some patients, for instance, “have problems weaning from ventilation—they do not wake up, and so far, we do not really understand why,” Radbruch says.
Curiously, some patients also exhibit signs of microscopic damage to the small blood vessels in their brains, as evidenced in Nath and his colleagues’ recent brain autopsy study. The SARS-CoV-2–positive subjects—who were obtained from New York City’s chief medical examiner’s office—represent a unique patient cohort, most of them having died suddenly. Some had been found dead in nursing homes or in the subway, Nath says. In 10 of 13 patient brains examined under a high-resolution MRI scanner, the team noticed patches that appeared unusually bright or dark—the latter likely signifying signs of bleeding. Scrutinizing those areas, which sometimes included the olfactory bulb, the team found evidence of damaged blood vessel walls. And wherever blood vessels were damaged, protein staining revealed leakage of fibrinogen—a blood coagulation protein whose presence in the brain is associated with various neurological disorders—into neural tissue. Clustering around those sites they found macrophages and sometimes also activated microglia and T cells.
A plausible hypothesis is that some of those immune cells attack the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels, a cell type that SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect. Nath’s study didn’t find any evidence of that, but “at least that’s one way to explain it,” he says. “And maybe that’s what’s causing the leakage. Then once you get the fibrinogen in the brain, you can incite more inflammation there . . . so it keeps building up a spiral.”
He and his team also discovered signs that shine light on the patients’ sudden deaths. Assuming the patients died of cardiac dysfunction, they examined the nuclei in the base of the brainstem involved in the control of breathing. There, they spotted macrophages clustering around those neurons, a possible sign of neuronophagia, in which phagocytes devour unhealthy neurons. “These respiratory centers and some of these other brainstem nuclei are impaired in their function,” Nath says. It’s hard to say how generalizable these findings are among COVID-19 patients, but “I think it’s quite possible that some of these long-term symptoms that people have may be related to some of these things.” Along with other researchers, he’s working on a series of studies in “long hauler” patients to find out.
It’s unlikely that one mechanism of neurological effects will fit all patients. Finding out what causative processes are unfolding in individuals will require integrating different techniques and many more brain autopsies, of which there have been only around a few hundred reported so far, largely due to a shortage of specialized equipment and labs to conduct them, Nath says. It will also require some sorting of what is currently a hodgepodge of neurological symptoms—for example, by establishing diagnostic criteria of post-COVID-19 syndrome and defining what acute versus chronic symptoms are, Mukerji adds.
She says she hopes that these studies will also help those with neurological conditions caused by other infections. “There are a variety of people who’ve had [viral] infections [such as] Ebola or West Nile, who have said that they have cognitive complaints, brain fog, and that they’re disabled—and it’s largely fallen on some deaf ears,” she says. “I would be surprised if the world does not take up this discussion much more scientifically than it has done in the past [and] try to understand if we can develop . . . some sort of diagnostic, and then some sort of therapeutic agent to help what is now going to be a large percentage of the world’s population.”  
Coronavirus Variant Linked to COVID-19 Outbreaks in California/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

O
n Sunday (January 17), public health officials announced that the SARS-CoV-2 variant L452R has become increasingly common in multiple Californian counties and is responsible for several large COVID-19 outbreaks in the state.
L452R was first detected in Denmark in March 2020 and later identified in the US last year, but recent sequencing results from California show that the proportion of COVID-19 cases associated with this variant rose from 3.8 percent to 25 percent between mid-November and late December, The Mercury News reports. One of these outbreaks, according to The Washington Post, was linked to a hospital staff member in San Jose wearing an inflatable Christmas tree costume who might have infected at least 90 people with the L452 variant.
“It is common to identify variants of viruses like SARS-CoV-2,” says Erica Pan, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health, in a statement. “It’s too soon to know if this variant will spread more rapidly than others.”
A highly transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK, is now spreading throughout the US and could become the dominant variant by March, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There’s no evidence that B.1.1.7 causes more severe disease than other variants or that it will evade vaccines.
See: “First US Case of UK SARS-CoV-2 Variant Detected”
The L452 variant has three mutations that are different from B.1.1.7’s mutations, including one in the spike protein, which allows the virus to attach to and enter cells. The spike protein is the target of the two vaccines approved for use in the US. “Now that we know this variant is on the rise in our local communities, we are prioritizing it for study,” Charles Chiu, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), says in the statement. “Researchers at UCSF and elsewhere will now be able to perform the critical laboratory experiments to determine whether or not this virus is more infectious or affects vaccine performance.”
“Because genomic sequencing is not done equally across the state or country, it is too soon to know how prevalent the 452 variant is statewide, nationally or globally,” the statement reads. Some experts say that the US is falling short in its sequencing efforts and a more coordinated approach is needed for effective surveillance of potentially more contagious new variants, The New York Times reported earlier this month. According to The Washington Post in late December, the US had genetically analyzed only about 0.3 percent of COVID-19 cases, putting the country 43rd in worldwide rankings of the percentage of cases sequenced at the time.
Past SARS-CoV-2 Infection Mostly Protects Survivors/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

mmune responses from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection reduce survivors’ risk of reinfection by more than 83 percent for at least five months, according to preliminary data from a study of more than 20,000 UK healthcare workers published by Public Health England. The researchers caution that people previously infected may still be able to transmit the virus.
“Overall I think this is good news,” Imperial College London epidemiologist Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser to Public Health England (PHE), tells The Guardian. “It allows people to feel that prior infection will protect them from future infections, but at the same time it is not complete protection, and therefore they still need to be careful when they are out and about.”
Between June and November last year, the researchers monitored, through monthly serological tests and PCR tests twice a month, the infection rates in those who had been infected with the virus before June and those who had not. They found 44 potential reinfections, including 13 symptomatic cases, among the 6,614 who’d had the virus before, and 318 cases among the 14,173 who had no evidence of past infection. The authors concluded from these results that prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 provides 94 percent protection against symptomatic reinfection, and 75 percent protection against asymptomatic reinfection.
See “More SARS-CoV-2 Reinfections Reported, But Still a Rare Event”
The researchers also found that people who become reinfected can carry a high viral load in their noses and throats, even in asymptomatic cases, which correlates with a higher risk of spreading the virus to others, says Hopkins.
“Reinfection is pretty unusual, so that’s good news,” University of Pennsylvania immunologist John Wherry tells Nature. “But you’re not free to run around without a mask.”
“The immunity gives you a similar effect to the Pfizer vaccine and a much better effect than the AstraZeneca vaccine and that is reassuring for people. But we still see people who could transmit and so we want to strike a note of caution,” Hopkins tells The Guardian. In clinical trials, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 95 percent effective at preventing infection, compared with 62 percent from two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for emergency use in the UK, Canada, Mexico, the US, Switzerland, and the EU, while the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for emergency use in the UK, Argentina, India, and Mexico. 
None of the individuals with potential reinfections had PCR-based evidence of a first infection, but all harbored antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the outset of the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in any medical journal. The authors tried to measure antibodies that were specific to SARS-CoV-2, but prior studies show that antibodies against other coronaviruses may cross-react to show a false positive result for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which is why the researchers termed these cases “possible reinfections.”
The PHE team does not yet have enough data to understand who might be at highest risk of reinfection. Francis Crick Institute immunologist George Kassiotis tells Nature that participants in the study were mainly women, and mostly under the age of 60. “This group is unlikely to experience the most severe form of COVID-19,” he says, “and may not be representative of the population as a whole.”
Correction (January 15): We omitted Mexico from the list of countries that have approved the Pfizer vaccine. The Scientist regrets the error.
High Risk of Bias in Early COVID-19 Studies: Meta-Analysis/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
BRIANAJACKSON
A
s scientists led initial investigations into the novel coronavirus last winter and spring, journal publishers saw an enormous surge in COVID-19 publications. A study published January 4 in BMC Medical Research Methodology reports that the majority of early clinical studies on the pandemic lacked original data, and those that did were rushed and did not include the appropriate measures to reduce bias.
See: “WHO Leads in Using Solid Science to Draft COVID-19 Policy: Study”
The researchers evaluated more than 10,000 COVID-19–related medical papers published in English or Chinese before May 2020. Among peer-reviewed papers, the researchers found that 56.1 percent were opinions that did not contain any new data. Original articles that included patient data represented only 9.6 percent of the peer-reviewed studies. The researchers then evaluated the quality of research of the original articles using validated tools to assess study design and concluded that 80 percent were at risk of bias, mainly because of few participants, short follow-up duration, unrepresentative patient selection, or poor data interpretation. 
The Scientist conducted an interview over email with Paris Transplant Group nephrologist and epidemiologist Alexandre Loupy and Paris Transplant Group statistician Marc Raynaud, coauthors of the new study.

The Scientist: What was the motivation for undertaking this meta-analysis?
Alexandre Loupy: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, we all have seen the spectacular increase in the number of publications that were COVID-19 related. As the virus was spreading around the world, it generated a global sense of urgency which had consequences for medical research. We saw that most of the first publications were mainly people giving advice and their personal reaction to the pandemic. What I feared was to see the standards of medical science getting lower, and the peer-review system losing quality. . . . We were saddened to observe that the studies published during the first wave of the pandemic were far from meeting conventional standards of scientific quality.
This risk of expedited science has been voiced by many other researchers, as many key public health decisions were made based on these early studies. Besides, as you know, there are well-known specific examples of publications that were retracted—with direct consequences on public health, as it was the case with the ‘Lancet Gate.’ In that context, we felt confident that a thorough review of scientific trends and robust, honest criticism was warranted. This was our principal motivation: reviewing, categorizing and critically appraising all COVID-19 research. Such [an] investigation had not been carried out by other teams, given the vast amount of work needed to critically appraise all the medical literature. 
See “The Surgisphere Scandal: What Went Wrong?”
TS: How did you decide which studies to include in your analysis?
Marc Raynaud: This was actually quite straightforward: since we wanted to take a broad view of all the COVID-19 research, we needed to identify and review all publications that were related to COVID-19, regardless of the design or the type. Therefore, there were no restrictions on the publications identified in our study. I do think this approach is one of our big strengths, in that our review is the only one encompassing all study types and designs—both preprints and peer-reviewed articles. 
We primarily focused on studies published during the first six months of the pandemic. We believed that this was a key period to evaluate the quality of scientific production, as many extremely important decisions made by governments and agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO) were made based [on] this early scientific literature.
The first step was thus to create an international consortium with experts from France, the US and China, including experts on methodology, systematic review, epidemiology, public health, internal medicine, surgery and pathology. Then we could start the very long task of reviewing all COVID-19 publications.
TS: Were you surprised by how few studies with original data you found?
AL: This confirmed the impression we all had: ‘without-data’ papers drove much of the huge increase of COVID-19 publications. To give you an idea, in peer-reviewed research, almost 60% of COVID-19 publications were without-data papers. This is unprecedented! It shows the readiness and haste of many scientists who preferred to immediately comment on the pandemic rather than designing appropriate studies. But I want to underline that the study is not to blame anyone, but instead is a way for the field to reflect and perhaps better prepare for similarly difficult future situations. There was a race to publish, and the journals were faced with a flood of papers. It was an epidemic of scientific papers within a global pandemic. It was important to highlight this phenomenon with actual data and put number and statistics on it.
TS: You make a distinction between studies with original data as compared to case studies or opinion pieces. What role do those other pieces play in the scientific publishing landscape during a pandemic?
AL: We think case studies may have several roles. Sometimes, the readership of some medical specialty—such as cardiology—have asked for case studies to improve and adapt their clinical practice because they were facing a huge increase of the number of COVID-19 patients. But many case studies had contradictory results, and we feared it may have drawn attention away from more valid and better designed studies. We also think that many physicians and researchers wanted to contribute, which prompted many to publish early findings, without taking time to correctly design [their studies] and analyze their data.
The problem was the same with the numerous opinion pieces we identified; many wanted to comment on the pandemic. Even though some valuable advice and recommendations have been published, I think this has brought confusion overall. I know many physicians who did not know who to listen to, which study to trust. They got lost in the maze of contradictory medical research.
TS: Preprints played a big role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge during the pandemic. What were your findings about preprints?
MR: Overall, there was an important increase of the number of preprints; we found that almost a third of COVID-19 research was preprints. Our findings show that most of them had original data. But they should be considered cautiously; a preprint [is] a study not reviewed by experts. One preprint might eventually wind up in the New England Journal of Medicine, while another might never be published anywhere because of extensive flaws. The peer review process has value, after all. Other studies have highlighted that most of preprints remain at their preprints state, and do not move to the peer-review arena. I thus agree that preprints had a substantial influence, but we should consider those studies with adequate skepticism.
TS: In your analysis, you talk about the fine balance of velocity versus quality of publishing during a public health emergency. Did the scientific community prioritize one over the other during this pandemic?
MR: As we have underscored in our study, the assessment of research quality is a fundamental step in the advancement of scientific knowledge. However, in a pandemic, pressing time, converging towards scientific thoroughness appears to be particularly difficult. The balance between the velocity and the rigor of science is hence very hard to strike. What our study tells is that 80% of original studies are at middle to high risk of bias, according to robust and widely adopted evaluation tools and metrics. Therefore, I’d say that our study reveals a great deal of haste in conducting and accepting studies during the first six months of the pandemic. Even though we see that the quality of research is finally (and slowly) improving now, many researchers have rushed to publish poorly designed stud[ies] with scarce data, and regrettably, some still do. I think our study offers an important cautionary tale about the risks of rushing science to publication.
TS: Looking forward, what advice would you have for scientists hoping to publish a paper during a public health emergency?
AL: First, I’d advise to take time to read what has already been published on the topic. Second, I suggest being deliberate in correctly formulating their research hypothesis and study design. Third, scientists must make sure they have enough and relevant data. Fourth, it is important to apply appropriate statistical analyses. I believe that the pandemic has shown that too many lack skills in methodology, so in my opinion these four points are a good way to start.
Last, as a physician, I would like to make this final diagnosis: even though we have now developed vaccines for the COVID-19, some scientists are still carrying a harmful virus—the ‘rush to publications’ virus, whose only vaccine is criticism and then a commitment to good research hypothesis and design, appropriate data, and robust analyses.

US Confirms World’s First SARS-CoV-2 Cases in Gorillas/-/ABOVE: Two of the eight gorillas currently in quarantine at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park

hree western lowland gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the US Department of Agriculture announced yesterday (January 11), marking the first confirmed cases of the virus in great apes.
“Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Lisa Peterson, the executive director of the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, says in a statement. “The troop [of eight] remains quarantined together and are eating and drinking. We are hopeful for a full recovery.”
The three infected gorillas, which have runny noses and are lethargic, likely contracted the virus from an asymptomatic zoo worker, similar to the three lions and five tigers that tested positive at the Bronx Zoo in April, according to Peterson. 
Two of the gorillas first began coughing on January 6, says Peterson. Zoo staff collected fecal samples and sent them to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, which confirmed the infection on January 11 with the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories.
Caretakers decided to keep all eight gorillas together and monitor them closely. “Some may have it and others may not,” Peterson, tells National Geographic. “They live in a troop with a single silverback. He’s the leader. He guides them throughout the day. They look to him. It’s really best for them that they’re allowed to continue as they are.”
Poaching and disease—namely, Ebola virus—have caused western lowland gorilla populations to decline by more than 60 percent over the last two decades, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The animals live in tight-knit family groups, so researchers worry that if the virus reaches wild populations, it may spread quickly and imperil already diminished populations.
Not including lab animals infected for experimentation, gorillas are the seventh animal species known to have contracted the virus, after lions, tigers, snow leopards, minks, dogs, and house cats. Minks are the only animals known to transmit the virus to humans.
Earlier this year, a team of scientists predicted western lowland gorillas would be at very high risk of infection, as the protein sequence for the ACE2 receptor—which SARS-CoV-2 latches onto to enter cells—is identical to our own. 
See “US Primate Centers Work to Protect Animals from COVID-19”
Dan Ashe, the president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, tells National Geographic by email that the gorillas testing positive is “concerning,” but he has “complete confidence” that the San Diego Zoo staff is taking every precaution.
San Diego Zoo Safari Park plans to share its observations with health officials, conservationists, and scientists to help protect wild gorillas, according to the Associated Press. Primate research facilities have also taken precautions since early in the pandemic to protect their animals from transmission by human caretakers.
Julius Schachter, Renowned Chlamydia Researcher, Dies at 84/-/Julius "Julie" Schachter
UCSF
J
ulius Schachter, a leading microbiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, died December 20 from COVID-19. He was 84 years old.
“For decades he was the world’s authority on chlamydial diagnostics,” Tom Lietman, the director of the Francis I. Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology at UCSF and a longtime colleague of Schachter, says in a statement to colleagues shared with The Scientist. “He was also a legend in the sexually transmitted disease world, discovering that various chlamydia species could lead to systemic disease, and running the international chlamydial meetings.”
Trachoma, a chlamydia-related eye infection and one of the world’s leading causes of blindness until the 1990s, was the focus of much of Schachter’s research. In what Lietman calls a “seminal experiment,” Schachter found in 1999 that mass distribution of the oral antibiotic azithromycin was an effective way to treat the disease at a community-wide level in places where trachoma was out of control. 
“Everyone in health care is taught that nonspecific antibiotic use is forbidden,” Lietman tells The New York Times. But in areas where trachoma was widespread, it was too difficult to test the entire community and quarantine those with the disease. “Julie’s leap was to consider treating the entire community, whether they were infected or not.”
Within a year of his 1999 study, the World Health Organization (WHO) had established guidelines for mass distributions of the antibiotic to trachoma-stricken countries, and Pfizer had committed to offering the drug free of charge to national programs, according to Lietman’s statement. Nearly 1 billion doses of the drug have been distributed for trachoma worldwide since the turn of the century. The target date for global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is 2030, according to the WHO, in part thanks to Schachter’s research.
Schachter was born in the Bronx in 1936. He received his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1957, his master’s degree in physiology from Hunter College in 1960, and his doctorate in bacteriology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965. His first job was as an assistant research microbiologist at UCSF, where he remained for 55 years, later becoming a professor of laboratory medicine.
He served as the director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Chlamydiae from 1978 to 2003 and chair of the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostic Initiative of the UNAIDS Programme from 1997 to 2001. 
Schachter split his time between Germany and San Francisco and had flown to the Bay Area in November for Thanksgiving.
Schachter continued to work while hospitalized with COVID-19. Lietman recounts a conversation to the Times that they had on the day his friend was being moved to the intensive care unit.
“I’ve got to get out of here,” Schachter had told him. “I’ve got to finish these four manuscripts.”
He was married to his first wife Joyce Schachter from 1962 until her death in 1990. In 2018, Schachter married Elisabeth Scheer, a microbiologist at Roche Diagnostics, whom he’d been with since 1996. In addition to her and his daughter Sara Schachter, he is survived by a brother, Norbert, two sons, Marc Schachter and Alexander Scheer, and three grandsons.
Correction (January 13): The article previously misstated Elisabeth Scheer’s work affiliation and Julius Schachter’s residency. It also did not include Julius Schachter's first wife, Joyce Schachter. The Scientist regrets the errors.

UK Approves Arthritis Drugs for Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 
TEMPURA
L
ast week, the UK government issued a statement encouraging the use of tocilizumab and sarilumab, medications initially developed to improve arthritis symptoms, to treat severe COVID-19 cases. The recommendations are based on findings posted January 7 to the preprint server medRxiv that suggest the drugs could reduce the risk of death by 24 percent.
The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, evaluated around 800 patients in intensive care with severe COVID-19. Around half received the standard of care while 353 received tocilizumab and 48 received sarilumab. The researchers found that 35.8 percent of those given standard care died, compared with 28 percent who received tocilizumab and 22.2 percent who were given sarilumab.
“This is a significant step forward for increasing survival of patients in intensive care with COVID-19. The data shows that tocilizumab, and likely sarilumab, speed up and improve the odds of recovery in intensive care, which is crucial for helping to relieve pressure on intensive care and hospitals and saving lives,” Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, tells The Guardian.
See “The Immune Hallmarks of Severe COVID-19”
The immunosuppressive drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab, which are primarily used to treat arthritis, block signaling of the cytokine IL-6, a key regulator of immune dysregulation and inflammation in severe COVID-19 cases. Dozens of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 with tocilizumab and sarilumab are planned or underway, but published results regarding patient survival to date have been mixed.
The new study’s findings are “encouraging,” Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician at the Medical University of South Carolina who was not involved in the latest clinical trial, tells The New York Times. But, she adds, “I think we need to understand why this data looks different from other studies, before we start implementing this as widespread policy.”
See “Immune Biomarkers Tied to Severe COVID-19: Study”
The reason for the discrepancy may be because the new study included only patients with severe COVID-19, Jonathan Parr, an infectious diseases physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who also was not part of the work, tells The Washington Post. In contrast, he says, “Other published randomized trials primarily enrolled hospitalized patients with less severe disease.” Patients in the new study also received the drugs within 24 hours of entering intensive care, suggesting that early treatment could be important for improving patient survival.
What’s Ahead for SARS-CoV-2 Research in 2021/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DRAFTER123
E
ver since the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2 was first identified and sequenced by researchers in China a year ago, a tidal wave of research on the pathogen and its associated disease, COVID-19, has swamped the scientific literature. Indeed, an analysis posted as a preprint last month found that more than 84,000 papers related to COVID-19 were published in the first 11 months of 2020.
Even given that output and the recent rollout of vaccines against the disease, researchers who study the virus aren’t ready to put it on ice and move on to other problems. Here are some of the key areas where we’re likely to see advances in understanding this year.
Where did it come from?
Teasing out SARS-CoV-2’s origin is important, says disease ecologist Jonathan Epstein of EcoHealth Alliance, because knowing how the virus got into humans could yield clues about how to avoid future spillovers. The SARS outbreaks of 2003 and 2004 spurred research (of which Epstein was a part) that identified horseshoe bats as a reservoir for this family of coronaviruses, he notes, but it’s still not known exactly how either virus made it from bats to people. Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 jumped directly from bats into people, or whether it first infected a wild or domesticated intermediary species, would help in pinpointing particular human activities that could be putting us at risk of future zoonotic events, he says.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convenened a team to investigate the virus’s origins that began traveling to China early this month, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a January 5 briefing. According to WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević, the team’s plans include reviewing hospital records from late 2019 to identify illnesses that might have been COVID-19, interviewing people who were the first known cases, and finding out what animals were traded at a market in Wuhan associated with some early infections, and possibly other local markets around the time of the outbreak, and where those animals came from. Jašarević did not say when the team’s findings might be made available.
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
In addition to prevention, another benefit of knowing the animal origins of coronaviruses is the opportunity to design medicines against them in advance, namely, “broadly neutralizing antibodies that can hit not just SARS-2, but other related coronaviruses that we know are in animal reservoirs,” says virologist Kartik Chandran of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. That’s a long-term goal of his current work on identifying effective antibodies that can be used as a COVID-19 drug. And, he says, it will also be important to figure out how to develop vaccines that confer protection against a broad swath of such coronaviruses. “From a research standpoint, in the next few years, that’s going to be a major challenge.”
See “Predicting Future Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks”
More treatment options
Even with effective vaccines, humanity is likely stuck with SARS-CoV-2, much like the cold-causing coronaviruses and influenza, Chandran says. That means there’s an ongoing need for effective treatments for the disease. One issue with current monoclonal antibody treatments, he notes, is that they require large volumes to be administered by IV, creating logistical challenges. “If we can get these things to be potent enough, we ideally would be able to give them by intramuscular injection, rather than giving them IV—that would make a huge difference,” he says. “But that’s going to require a jump in potency that’s quite significant.” 
So far, one standalone monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab, and a combination of two, casirivimab and imdevimab, have received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both treatments were tested in clinical trials on people with mild or moderate disease, and the studies found that those who received them had about one-third the risk of visiting the ER or being hospitalized in the following four weeks compared with patients who got a placebo. Other currently available treatments include the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone, each of which are used for some hospitalized patients, and convalescent plasma, which, according to a small trial published this week, halved the risk of severe respiratory illness when given within three days of the onset of symptoms.
 “We were encouraged to see the quick pace of development of the monoclonal antibodies,” says Esther Krofah, the executive director of the FasterCures center at the nonprofit Milken Institute. “But I think there’s still a lot more to be done, particularly in an outpatient setting.” In particular, a small-molecule drug that could be taken by patients at home to reduce their chances of hospitalization would alleviate some of the pressure on the healthcare system. One such drug she’s keeping an eye on, camostat mesilate, is a protease inhibitor currently being tested in multiple clinical trials.
FasterCures is tracking more than 300 prospective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 that are in various stages of development. Krofah says she expects many current clinical trials not to yield conclusive results due to poor design or problems recruiting enough patients. One promising tack, she says, are the so-called master protocol studies that compare different treatments both with each other and with a placebo. 
A series of such trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, for example, several of which are expected to be completed later this year, are testing immune modulators, monoclonal antibodies, and blood thinners in groups of COVID-19 patients. In other trials, some repurposed antibiotics and an antifungal have also shown promise and could make it to the clinic this year, says Yasmeen Long, also of FasterCures.

Variant surveillance 
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, researchers will need to determine whether available vaccines are effective against newer variants, Chandran says, such as the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 variants that have drawn much attention in recent weeks. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, says that while current variants are “likely going to be covered by the existing vaccines, in the future, there may be new variants that can emerge that would evade the current vaccine”—meaning surveillance of viral variants should be a priority. 
To date, the US has sequenced 58,560 SARS-CoV-2 samples, compared to the UK’s 209,038, The New York Times reports, but a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official tells CNN that the agency and its partners are working to double the number of viral sequences they post publicly each week to about 6,500.  
The long haul
One of Iwasaki’s current projects is profiling the immune responses of people whose COVID-19 symptoms have lasted for months, a phenomenon known as long COVID. “Right now, there are thousands of people suffering from long COVID,” she says. “But there’s very little insight as to how the disease is caused and prolonged for so many people.”  
Understanding the mechanism of the disease could point the way to ways of treating it, she says, and might also shed light on other cases of chronic disease associated with an initial viral infection. In particular, after recently finding that hospitalized COVID-19 patients harbor distinct antibodies against their own proteins, known as autoantibodies, she and her colleagues have begun investigating whether such autoantibodies are at play in long COVID.

Mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Variant Does Not Affect Vaccine: Study/-/ABOVE: A patient cell infected with SARS-CoV-2

S
erum samples from 20 individuals who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 thwarted a version of the coronavirus with the so-called N501Y mutation, according to a preprint posted to bioRxiv yesterday (January 7). This mutation is one of many sequence changes present in the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 that were first detected in the UK and South Africa, respectively, and are now rapidly spreading around the world.
“There’s no reason to think the vaccines won’t work just as well on these strains,” Frederic Bushman of the University of Pennsylvania who tracks how the virus mutates and was not involved in the work, tells the Associated Press. But he adds that the study only examined one mutation and the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 variants have many more mutations that were not tested.
N501Y resides within the coronavirus’s spike protein that enables entry into host cells. Scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston had already engineered a version of SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation to study in mice when the new variants emerged, The Washington Post reports. The researchers collaborated with scientists at Pfizer to expose serum—an antibody-containing component of blood—from vaccine recipients to the engineered virus, and found no differences in neutralization between the N501Y virus and virus with the original Y501 sequence.
According to Reuters, Pfizer had challenged its vaccine against 15 other mutations previously, finding them all to be inconsequential. “So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer’s vice president and chief scientific officer of viral vaccines, tells Reuters. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.” 
In particular, scientists have expressed concern about a mutation in 501.V2 called E484K, which is next to be tested, Dormitzer tells the AP.
Coauthor Pei-Yong Shi of UTMB tells the Post he expects to receive a viral variant next week to study in the lab. Moderna, AstraZeneca, and other vaccine makers are also in the process of challenging their vaccines with the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 variants. Bushman tells the AP he expects similarly positive results. “A mutation will change one little place, but it’s not going to disrupt binding to all of them.”
Nevertheless, vaccine developers have not ruled out the possibility that a variant could evolve that would require reformulating vaccines. “These data don’t suggest a need for a change, but the mutations are hitting close enough to home that we need to be prepared,” Dormitzer tells STAT. 
WHO Leads in Using Solid Science to Draft COVID-19 Policy: Study/-/ABOVE: The World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland

A
s the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, scientific experts and policymakers have had to work together closely to keep up with the latest science and implement policies to prevent further transmission of the virus. Meanwhile, the pace at which COVID-19 research has been published has led misinformation to spread rampantly, sometimes working its way into the upper echelons of government.
To see how well policymakers worldwide incorporated solid COVID-19 research into their decisions, researchers examined scientific citations within 37,725 policy documents spanning 114 countries and 55 intergovernmental organizations that were drafted between early January and late May of last year. In a study published in Science yesterday (January 7), they found that these documents referenced COVID-19 papers that had, on average, 40 times more citations than other COVID-19 papers. Peer-reviewed papers from leading scientific journals were far more represented in policy documents than were preprints, the researchers found.
The Scientist spoke with Northwestern University economist Benjamin Jones, a coauthor of the new study, about why these results surprised him.
The Scientist: What was your motivation for conducting this study?
Benjamin Jones
KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
Benjamin Jones: First, conceptually, there’s a long-standing set of questions and concerns about the extent to which science is drawn upon in policy—does policy pay attention to science at all? But also, does it pay attention to good science? That goes back to C.P. Snow’s examination of World War II in the importance of science in the war efforts and who got listened to. [Editor’s note: Chemist and novelist C.P. Snow wrote The Two Cultures, an influential essay in which he lamented the cultural divide separating the arts and sciences.] So I think there’s a broad set of questions and concerns about how policy draws on science, and that’s been long studied.
The second channel is that Big Data has come to research on all sorts of questions. We have increasingly exploited these incredible datasets of every scientific publication. And more recently we’re seeing the attempt to see how science is being drawn upon in other kinds of domains. I’ve done some work on how science is used, for example, in patenting and we’re seeing work on how science is used in the media, but now we’re actually beginning to see better and better data opportunities for how science is referenced in policy.
We had a new dataset, Overton, that allowed us to come into that, and then of course we have COVID on the mind, so that’s a chance to really see this interaction in real time. 
TS: So you had this giant database with tens of thousands of papers. How did you analyze them? 
BJ: In some sense, we’re doing something very basic—the very first thing you would do—which is we see this explosion of work in science about COVID, and then we have the data with pretty much real-time policy documents that are being produced. It was a chance to see if all the policy that has been developed around COVID is in fact aware of and referencing all of this science related to COVID. We’re basically merging this giant global database of policy documents [with] this very large database of evolving science. We can both see if it’s linked, and then we can see, is it linked to the good science or less-vetted science, and we can see who’s doing the linking—which institutions in the policy domain seem to be important for bridging into that science and bringing those ideas and insights into policy. 
TS: We’ve all seen misinformation spread very quickly during the pandemic. Did you find that less-rigorous science impacted policymakers?
BJ: The classic idea is that [policymakers] are just a very different community of people with different expertise. Does the average policymaker understand physics, chemistry, or infectious disease biology? Probably not, so how do they even know what to cite and adjudicate? And in the current social media context or certain political contexts [where] there’s misinformation, one’s even more concerned that people aren’t even trying to access the right knowledge, they’re trying to select whatever makes their point as opposed to thinking about what good science is saying. 
We were quite positively surprised that the number one finding is both that all of these new policy documents are able to interface with the new science—they’re not ignoring it; they’re drawing on it—and more importantly, they seem to be drawing on the high impact science—the stuff that scientists themselves recognize as important, peer-reviewed, and appearing in the vetted places. 
We were quite positively surprised that the number one finding is both that all of these new policy documents are able to interface with the new science—they’re not ignoring it; they’re drawing on it—and more importantly, they seem to be drawing on the high impact science.
—Benjamin Jones, Northwestern University
TS: What was your most surprising finding? 
BJ: Beyond the fact that there’s this strong link with quality, which is comforting, I was struck by how important the World Health Organization appears in the picture. What we saw is that different national governments have different tendencies to draw on science directly. But in general, governments draw on it less, and these international intergovernmental organizations like the WHO draw on it correspondingly far more. In fact, a lot of the way that the science is getting into policy documents at the national level is indirect, so it’s basically the World Health Organization, say, will write something, drawing out all this latest science, and then other governments will cite this WHO policy document as opposed to citing the science directly.
That’s interesting because obviously we see in the pandemic different countries have taken very different approaches, and we see that in the data—there’s enormous heterogeneity in the use of science, so not everyone’s listening. The good stuff is getting into policy, but that doesn’t mean all policymakers or governments are listening. We see that the places like the WHO, which of course has been pilloried by some political actors in this pandemic, clearly play a very central role. I mean they really are the center of that whole network drawing science into policy. 
TS: Preprint servers have played a big role for disseminating new scientific findings quickly during the pandemic. How were those studies used in policy?
BJ: We’ve seen some [preprints] that have gotten a lot of attention in the media and then turned out maybe not to be right. One thing we wondered within that question of what kind of science gets drawn on was whether the policy community would do the same thing and dive in on these brand new papers that weren’t vetted. That might not be a bad thing because speed matters in the pandemic. 
But what we really see very strongly is that of all the COVID stuff going up on preprint servers, that stuff has a far, far, far lower chance of being drawn on. The policy documents really strongly emphasize the peer-reviewed work that’s been accepted. That’s interesting—I think it suggests that journals are continuing to play a very important role in helping policymakers select what work to draw upon.
TS: Looking forward to future potential public health emergencies, what lessons do you think we can learn from the data that you’ve analyzed?
BJ: The roadblock is not that policymakers just don’t know about science necessarily or can’t know about it. The roadblock is not that they’re unable to figure out what the right science is—when they cite it, they cite the good stuff. It seems like the roadblock to effective use of science, therefore, in policy is going to depend a lot on whether people are really listening in different governments and different parts of the government. It suggests that there is an idiosyncratic nation-specific roadblock to the use of science in policy. And that of course comports with what we’re seeing and have seen throughout this pandemic.

Severe Allergic Reactions to COVID-19 Vaccine Are Rare: CDC/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KOVOP58
A
s vaccines to protect against COVID-19 continue to roll out across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented a small number of reports of severe allergic reactions from some recipients. A report from the CDC, published Wednesday (January 6) in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, finds that most of these rare events occurred in those with a history of allergic reactions.
As of December 23, nearly 1.9 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine had been administered across the country, according to the report, with 21 verified cases of anaphylaxis that followed, a rate of 11.1 per million doses. Four of the individuals did not have a medical history of severe allergic reactions. Among those who did, seven had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. Epinephrine, the drug used in Epi-Pens, was given to 19 of the patients, and four were admitted to the hospital. Follow-up information was available for 20 of the patients, all of whom have since been discharged from the hospital or have recovered from their reaction.
“The good news is how rare these allergic reactions are and how readily recognizable and treatable they are,” Paul Offit, who serves on an external vaccine advisory committee to the US Food and Drug Administration, tells The Washington Post. “Yes, there’s an extremely small risk, but not a single person has died from the allergic reaction, while plenty of people have died from the virus.”
Everyone who receives the vaccine is advised to stay put for 15 minutes to monitor any harmful side effects, while it is recommended that those with a history of allergic reactions wait half an hour. The report found that the median time to onset of symptoms was 13 minutes. Only one person went over an hour before the reaction occurred, having a delay of 150 minutes. The CDC advises that anyone who experiences anaphylaxis after the first dose refrain from getting the second dose.
“People have a higher chance of getting hurt driving to the clinic for a shot than from the shot itself,” Offit, who codeveloped the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine, continues.
The median age of the patients was 40, with a range of 27–60. Nineteen of the patients were women, and women also make up 61 percent of vaccine recipients, according to the report. There was no common thread among the preexisting allergies listed, which included tropical fruit, nuts, penicillin, and sulfa drugs, among many others. 
The report acknowledges multiple limitations of the study, chief among them that the data came from reports posted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is often an incomplete source of information. There also could be a heightened response in suspecting anaphylaxis, as the vaccine is so new and has been covered extensively in the media. There also could be a lag between when reports show up in VAERS and an accurate count of how many doses have been administered. Finally, the Moderna vaccine was only available for two days before data collection, so very few of those vaccines had been given at the time of the report.
Representatives from the CDC say that the risk of an allergic reaction from the vaccine is worth taking, given how deadly COVID-19 continues to be, as the US surpasses 360,000 total deaths.
“Of course, we all would hope that any vaccine would have zero adverse events. But even at 11 cases per million doses administered, it’s a very safe vaccine,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said at a Wednesday news conference, according to STAT. “We’re in the setting of 2,000 Covid deaths per day. . . . I would say it’s still a good value proposition for someone to get vaccinated.”

cientists are testing if COVID-19 vaccines will protect against newly identified UK and South African SARS-CoV-2 variants, both of which contain an unusual number of mutations compared to other variants of the coronavirus. These mutations are concentrated mainly in the segment of the virus’s genome that codes for the spike protein, which the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines each build immunity to.
This additional research comes as British health secretary Matt Hancock says he is more concerned about the South African variant, known as 501.V2, as it relates to vaccine efficacy than the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7.
“One of the reasons they know they’ve got a problem is because, like us, they have an excellent genomic scientific capability to be able to study the details of the virus,” Hancock tells BBC radio, referring to a conversation with a South African health official. “And it is even more of a problem than the U.K. new variant.”
Spike protein shape shifter
While the UK variant was first detected in September, officials noticed that it was rapidly spreading through the country in mid-December, leading to tighter restrictions on movement and businesses within days. South African officials reported on December 18 that 501.V2 had been largely replacing other strains of the coronavirus as early as November. 
501.V2 carries a mutation in the spike protein called E484K, which is not present in the UK strain, Francois Balloux, the director of the University College London Genetics Institute, says in a statement. “The E484K mutation has been shown to reduce antibody recognition,” he says, which may help the virus bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination. However, he says that the mutation is not sufficient for the variant to bypass the protection provided by vaccines.
John Bell, a University of Oxford immunologist who is on the UK’s vaccine task force, tells Times Radio that he thinks vaccines would work on the UK variant but there is a “big question mark” about 501.V2, as there is still sparse evidence about it.
Experts say mutations of the virus are to be expected. “Viruses mutate and new strains will emerge,” James Naismith, the director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, says in a statement. “The so-called South African strain has a number of changes, and scientists are working flat out to understand their significance. Some of the changes are quite significant and thus scientists are paying a lot of attention. We do not yet know enough to say more than this.”
In the unlikely scenario that the variant significantly lowers a vaccine’s efficacy, Bell estimates that it would take four to six weeks to develop a modified vaccine. “We’re now in a game of cat and mouse,” he tells Times Radio. “These are not the only two variants we’re going to see.”
Do approved vaccines work on 501.V2?
Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal who is working on genomic studies of the variant, tells the Associated Press that studying how effective the vaccines are against 501.V2 is “the most pressing question facing us right now.” 
He and his colleagues are performing neutralizing assays using the blood of people who have been previously infected with the virus and the blood of people who have received vaccines to try to answer this question.
Albert Einstein College of Medicine virologist Kartik Chandran tells The Scientist in an email that it would also be useful to investigate cell-mediated immunity, which is a response driven by T cells and may be less sensitive to mutations in the spike protein than the neutralizing antibody response is.
Like the UK variant, scientists suspect that 501.V2 is more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2 are, as it has rapidly become dominant in the country’s coastal areas. Lessells says he expects the variant will quickly become dominant in Johannesburg, the country’s largest city, and the surrounding provinces.
South Africa is currently experiencing a resurgence of the virus with new cases and deaths rising rapidly, surpassing what the country experienced in its first surge in late July.
After the first cases of the UK variant were detected in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aims to sequences as many as 6,500 samples of the virus per week, compared to the 3,000 per week it is currently sequencing. 501.V2 has not yet been detected in the US.
US Officials Debate Efficacy of Half Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FG TRADE
Update (January 5): On Monday evening, the FDA stated that dosing in the US will occur as planned, based on available data regarding efficacy, saying: “We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster. However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.”

fficials involved with the United States’s Operation Warp Speed—the program tasked with expediting the creation of a vaccine for COVID-19—are discussing the merits of rationing the Moderna vaccine for adults aged 18–55, as is being discussed in the United Kingdom. This would be accomplished either by giving half doses of the first shot or delaying the immunization’s second shot, Moncef Slaoui, the head of OWS, tells CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Ultimately, the Food and Drug Administration will determine if the vaccines can be given on a different schedule, and a decision has not yet been made.
Originally, OWS anticipated that 20 million vaccine doses would have been distributed by the end of 2020. As of January 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 13 million doses have gone out, and 4.23 million people in the US have received at least one dose, primarily frontline healthcare workers and nursing home residents so far. Going off-schedule for lower-risk adults would allow twice as many people to receive their first shot, Slaoui says. The vaccine’s urgency has become more pronounced as a more contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 that originated in the UK has now been found in the US.
If reducing the volume of the first dose is approved by the FDA, the rationing would only affect the vaccine made by Moderna, Slaoui explains, which he claims would still provide the same protection as a full dose. Officials from Moderna have not yet verified if that is the case. Germany is also deliberating holding off on the second shot to spread around more initial doses, while Denmark has already approved the measure, Reuters reports.
Officials from Pfizer and BioNTech released a joint statement last week in response to the UK’s desire to hold off on the second dose from the initial plan of 21 days to as long as 12 weeks after the first. “The safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules as the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design,” the statement reads, according to Reuters.
Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with other medical experts around the globe, say they disagree that rationing would be effective, The New York Times reports. Fauci says that the US will not be following the UK’s lead to delay the second dose, should the British government decide to do that. Still, it will be down to the FDA to decide if altered dosing will be permitted.
Speaking on CNN, Leana Wen, the former health commissioner of Baltimore, agrees with Fauci’s take. “I understand the desire to stretch out the doses that we have and to say, ‘Hey, if one dose can offer some partial protection, why not give it to as many people as we can?’ The problem, though, is that is not how the studies were conducted.”
Human Fetuses Can Contract SARS-CoV-2, but It’s Rare/-/ABOVE: MODIFIED FROM © ISTOCK.COM, ELENA MAKEEVA

rucilla Roberts and Vanda Torous stared at the placental tissue of two babies—fraternal twins—and were stunned by what they saw. The twins had shared the same womb and obviously the same mother, who’d tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during delivery, yet the babies’ individual placentas looked very different, Roberts recalls. The tissue of one of the placentas was severely inflamed, riddled with immune cells. The other one looked healthy. When Roberts and Torous, who are both pathologists at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, ordered tests of the placental tissue for markers of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation-riddled organ appeared to be heavily infected with the virus, while the other one had relatively little viral RNA. 
Neither twin tested positive for the novel coronavirus after birth, Roberts tells The Scientist. “The babies are fine.” The fact that one placenta was heavily infected by the virus and severely inflamed while the other was only mildly infected raises questions about the organ’s role in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to offspring during pregnancy, she notes.
At the time that Roberts and Torous identified the twins’ surprisingly distinct placentas, researchers had begun to gather data suggesting that the virus could indeed pass to a fetus during pregnancy. The most persuasive evidence came from a 23-year-old mother in France. At the time of delivery, her nasal swab, blood, and amniotic fluid all tested positive for the virus, and so did the baby’s nasal swab. The baby boy also developed symptoms of COVID-19, and scans of his brain revealed the organ to be inflamed, with damage to the white matter, similar to what had been reported in adults who suffered encephalitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Not only did that case study demonstrate that a pregnant mom could in fact pass the virus on to her unborn child, it also highlighted concerns that such transmission could have devastating consequences for the baby, says Roberto Romero, the chief maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Detroit-based Perinatology Research Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). After that study was published in July, he explains, one of the most pressing questions in understanding COVID-19 and pregnancy became: “What is the frequency with which mothers pass the virus to the fetus?”
The current data indicate that infected moms-to-be pass the virus to their babies relatively infrequently, perhaps only in about 1 percent of pregnant women who contract COVID-19, though some estimates are as high as 30 percent. With Zika virus, the rate of maternal-fetal transmission is, at a minimum, 10 percent, and with cytomegalovirus, a type of herpes virus, it’s roughly 30 percent in the first and second trimester and as high as 70 percent in the third trimester. The placenta, Roberts’s and others’ studies indicate, may be a better buffer against transmission from mother to baby in cases of SARS-CoV-2 than when the woman is infected with those other viruses. 
Just because the baby doesn’t contract the novel coronavirus in utero doesn’t mean there’s no risk of complications after birth. If a fetus is exposed to inflammation because of the mother’s viral infection, there could be long-term effects, explains Diana Bianchi, a medical geneticist and neonatologist and the director of NICHD. “We don’t know yet.”

Tracking SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the placenta
From the moment she wakes up until seconds before she goes to sleep, pediatrician Elisha Wachman combs the medical records of pregnant mothers slated to deliver their babies at Boston Medical Center, where she works. The instant she sees one of the moms has delivered, she arranges childcare for her kids, coordinates with her collaborators, and rushes to the hospital to retrieve the placenta from a dedicated fridge in the Labor & Delivery ward of the hospital. 
“This has been a nonstop, twenty-four-seven ordeal . . . with many, many nights, weekends, four am stints in the lab,” Wachman says, “because, you know, women do not deliver between nine and five, Monday through Friday.”
Wachman and her collaborator Elizabeth Taglauer, who is also affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital, want to know more about the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Since early on in the pandemic, Wachman, Taglauer, and their research assistant have been collecting and analyzing placentas from women who tested positive for COVID-19 while pregnant. In August, based on PCR tests for viral RNA and examinations of the organs under a microscope, the team reported that all 15 placentas they’d collected from these mothers showed signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in five cases, the virus was passed to the baby—a transmission rate of  about 30 percent.
This result stands in stark contrast to much lower estimates of other studies. In a paper published the month before Wachman and Taglauer’s, Roberts’s team examined 19 placentas from moms who were carrying the virus at the time they gave birth, and only two showed signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while none of the babies tested positive for the virus. Since then, Roberts has looked at more than 50 additional placentas of infected moms and identified five others, including both twins, that showed signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and each of these babies except the twins tested positive for the virus—a transmission rate of 4.3 percent. In Italy, pathologist Fabio Facchetti of the University of Brescia and colleagues found a comparable rate—of 15 women who got a positive SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of delivery, only one (6.7 percent) transmitted the virus to her child—and Facchetti says that additional data he has since collected suggest that this may be an overestimate. An NIH-funded study published in December found no evidence of vertical transmission in babies born to 64 women who tested positive for the virus at the time of delivery.
To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 can pass from a pregnant mother to her unborn child, researchers have been taking a closer look at the placenta under the microscope. They’ve analyzed the fetus-supporting tissue not only for the viral infection but also for immune cells that may be trying to prevent transmission. So far, the data suggest that the virus can pass through the placenta and into the fetal blood, but this type of viral transmission is rare.

An estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in newborns from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seems to agree with Facchetti’s analysis. Released in November, the data show that, of 610 babies tested for the virus at birth, 16 (2.6 percent) were infected. The babies that were infected were primarily born to mothers who tested positive for the virus within a week of delivery. However, the report did not include information on whether or not the placentas of the babies were infected, so it’s not clear that the infants contracted the virus in the womb. 
Researchers haven’t yet figured out why Wachman and Taglauer’s team found such high transmission compared with other estimates to date. It could have to do with the demographics of the women in the study or some other factor, says Roberts, who has reached out to collaborate with the other researchers. She says their findings about the location of inflammation in the infected placentas align with her own.
A closer look at SARS-CoV-2 infection in placentas
When Romero learned about cases of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus over the summer, he and his colleagues began investigating in healthy placental cells the levels of transcription of ACE2, the gene encoding the cell receptor that the virus uses to gain entry into human cells, and TMPRSS2, the gene than encodes an enzyme that cleaves the virus’s spike protein and helps with viral entry into the cell. In the RNA sequencing data, he and his colleagues found transcription of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was exceedingly low, far lower than the transcription of the receptors for Zika or cytomegalovirus. Such low activity of these genes in the placenta, he says, could help to explain why transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to baby is relatively uncommon. 
However, examining the abundance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in SARS-CoV-2–infected and healthy placental tissue seems to tell a slightly different story, according to Wachman and Taglauer’s study. In their infected tissue samples, ACE2 was prevalent, while TMPRSS2 was completely absent in both infected and control samples. Both Romero and Wachman note that the low TMPRSS2 levels might indicate that the virus could be using alternative cellular entry molecules to get into placental cells. ACE2 was even more abundant in healthy tissue than in the placental tissues of infected moms, Wachman and Taglauer found. This pointed to the possibility that the placenta could be downregulating ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly to prevent further viral spread. But, the researchers write, “the findings from this limited descriptive analysis are not sufficient to make any true conclusion on this point.” 
Looking at the spatial distribution of cells in the placenta, Wachman and Taglauer’s team found that cells carrying ACE2 were most prevalent in the outer layer of the syncytiotrophoblast, the protective, glove-like epithelial covering of the placenta that sits closer to the mother’s uterine lining than it does to the developing fetus’ amniotic sac. That’s also where most of the SARS-CoV-2–infected cells were found. Keeping the virus localized there, away from the fetus, Wachman says, may help to explain why transmission rates from mother to fetus are often low, even when the placenta is infected.

Facchetti’s team also found evidence of the virus in the syncytiotrophoblast of the mom-baby pair in which both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There were also signs of inflammation in other parts of the placenta. In the intervillous space, which surrounds the finger-like chorionic villi that house the maternal and fetal blood vessels, for example, the researchers found activated innate immune cells from the mother, hinting they’d come to the placenta to combat infection.
Roberts thinks the buildup of these immune cells might be a distinct histological footprint of SARS-CoV-2–infected placentas. She saw it in many of the placentas she studied, as did Wachman, who had some samples with so much inflammation that the placentas had large, easily visible chunks of white or gelatinous scar tissue that uninfected placentas lacked. Because that kind of inflammation, what’s called intervillositis, in the placenta is rare, “to see it in a SARS-CoV-2–infected mom is a red flag that you might have placental infection,” Roberts says. “And if you have placental infection, you might have fetal, or neonatal, infection.”
In the placenta Facchetti’s team studied, there was a clue as to how SARS-CoV-2 might sometimes spread from mother to the baby. Examining ultrathin slices of the placenta with an electron microscope, he and his colleagues spotted a viral particle inside a white blood cell in one of the fetal capillaries, hinting that the virus was in the mother’s blood that was sent to the fetus. At first, “I did not believe it,” Facchetti says, “since it is not so easy to find.” But slowly, with more imaging, the team became convinced of what they were seeing, and they concluded that the virus was getting into the mother’s blood, probably through the lungs, and then circulating throughout her body and into her baby.
Immediately after birth, that newborn’s lungs didn’t appear to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (a nasal swab gave an inconclusive result), but hours later, the baby boy tested positive for the virus and soon suffered lung damage consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumonia-related symptoms. Facchetti and his colleagues were curious as to why there was a delay in the viral spread after birth. A possible explanation, he writes in an email to The Scientist, is that the fetal lungs are dormant during gestation, with the mom’s lungs working to oxygenate her blood, which is then shared with her baby. After birth, a baby takes his first breaths, and the lungs begin expanding and contracting and pumping blood in and out. Because the baby was quarantined from his mother after birth, his illness indicates that the virus was probably circulating in the baby’s blood and moved into the lungs after birth, Facchetti says. “However, I admit that this is quite speculative.”
Risks to baby of mom’s SARS-CoV-2 infection
The baby in Facchetti’s case recovered quickly, as did the five in Wachman and Taglauer’s study. Others have taken longer to recover. The boy born with neurological abnormalities still had residual injury to the white matter of his brain months after birth, though it was less severe, and preliminary evidence indicates that if a woman gets infected with SARS-CoV-2 earlier in pregnancy, the outcome could be more dire. 
In June of last year, for example, David Baud of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland, reported on a second-trimester miscarriage potentially tied to COVID-19. The 28-year-old mom-to-be was 19 weeks pregnant when she came to the hospital with a high fever, dry cough, mild pain when swallowing, and diarrhea. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a nasal swab, was given oral acetaminophen, and was discharged. Two days later, she returned, with all the same symptoms and now having labor contractions. Ten hours later, she delivered a stillborn child who tested negative for the virus. The placenta, however, tested positive. 
Two days after the birth, the mother again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab, but her blood, urine, and vaginal swab were all negative. Because her blood tested negative for the virus, it’s unclear how it would have made it to the placenta, Roberts says, and it’s a reason why so many more detailed examinations of afterbirths began.

It’s unclear if the mother’s infection caused the miscarriage, Baud concedes. A June study tracking 427 women in the UK who contracted SARS-CoV-2 while pregnant noted that three suffered stillbirths, though a JAMA report published in December found no increase in stillbirths regionally or nationally in the UK during the pandemic. A study published in the same edition of JAMA on two Philadelphia hospitals also found no increase in stillbirths or preterm births. Recently released CDC data, however, show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with preterm birth. Of 3,912 babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 12.9 percent came earlier than 37 weeks gestation. Typically, only 10 percent of babies are born that early in the US. In addition to the spread of the virus from mother to fetus, a maternal infection has the potential to generate antibodies that could be shared across the placenta. However, a study published in December showed that in the third trimester, transfer of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus was significantly lower than the transfer of influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies.
The data are concerning, Baud says. In a report published in October, he noted that MERS and SARS infections during pregnancy were linked with restricted fetal growth and miscarriage, something his team is now watching for in their pregnant patients. They have been testing their pregnant patients monthly for SARS-CoV-2, and for those who do contract the virus, “so far, it seems there is no increased risk of abnormality,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. A smaller study published in JAMA in November backs Baud’s observations: in an analysis of 252 women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 while pregnant, the study authors found no association with adverse outcomes when the women gave birth. Still, Baud notes, “long-term impact and risk of growth retardation need further investigations.”  
Part of the concern is that studies in mice have connected maternal infections with autism-like behaviors in their offspring. And other research has shown that babies born to human moms infected with Zika during pregnancy have suffered from microcephaly. Because there is little known about COVID-19, the long-term effects of being infected while pregnant are unknown, which led the US National Institutes of Health to launch a study of COVID-19 and pregnancy near the start of the pandemic. From March to December, doctors at 12 sites across the country reviewed the medical records of pregnant women; now they’re comparing outcomes of those pregnancies to data from 2019. In addition to the risks that infection may pose to fetuses, the researchers leading the study, called GRAVID (the Gestational Research Assessments for coVID), hypothesize that there will be more complications, such as hypertension and blood clots, in pregnant women. Already, data show that if pregnant women do contract COVID-19, expectant mothers are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, and die than are women of similar age who are not pregnant.
“What’s been terrifying for all of us is that we are essentially learning on the fly,” Bianchi says. “This is a new disease, and it’s vitally important to collect as much data as we can so that we can understand it.”

First US Case of UK SARS-CoV-2 Variant Detected/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
DRAFTER123 
Update (December 31): California officials announced a case of the variant in a 30-year-old San Diego County man who had not traveled outside the country, suggesting the virus was transmitted by someone else in the community. A household contact has also developed symptoms, officials said, and is being tested. Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle tells The New York Times that he expects a similar trajectory of the variant in the US as in the UK: the variant accounts for few cases now, but might constitute the majority of cases in a few months, due to its increased transmissibility.
C
olorado officials yesterday reported the first known US case, followed by an additional suspected case today (December 30), of the COVID-19 variant that has swept across the UK, leading dozens of countries to restrict UK arrivals. Although the variant appears to transmit more efficiently between people, it is no more likely to cause a more severe infection, according to a preliminary report from Public Health England (PHE) released on Monday.
“It didn’t teleport across the Atlantic,” Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage tells The New York Times. The newly reported case “should not be cause for panic,” he says, adding, “it is cause to redouble our efforts at preventing the virus from getting the opportunity to spread.”
Both the confirmed case and the suspected case are members of the Colorado National Guard who had been deployed to help with a COVID-19 outbreak at the Good Samaritan Society assisted living facility in Simla, about 45 miles northeast of Colorado Springs, state health officials announced during a Wednesday news conference. The confirmed case is a man in his 20s that has no travel history, according to a tweet from the office of Colorado governor Jared Polis.
Additional cases with the new variant will be detected in the United States in coming days, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted in a statement to The Washington Post Tuesday. The variant’s apparent increase in contagiousness “could lead to more cases and place greater demand on already strained health care resources,” the agency says.
Researchers had detected the more transmissible variant in at least 17 countries outside the UK as of Tuesday, including Australia, Canada, and South Korea.
“Now I’m worried there will be another spring wave due to the variant,” epidemiologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle tells Associated Press. “It’s a race with the vaccine, but now the virus has just gotten a little bit faster.”
It is unlikely that people who were previously infected with COVID-19 will be reinfected if exposed to the variant, according to the PHE report. Experts say that COVID-19 vaccines will most likely confer immunity against the variant.
The arrival of the new variant “doesn’t fundamentally change the nature of the threat,” Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiologist Justin Lessler tells the Post. “It’s no more deadly than the virus was before, and it doesn’t look like it infects people who are immune.”
Lessler says he would be “astounded” if this were the only case of the variant in the US. “We know that the virus spreads easily and quickly between countries,” he says, and the patient’s lack of travel history indicates “this strain has gotten here sometime in the past, and there are chains of transmission ongoing.”
Preliminary UK contact tracing data suggest that of people known to have been exposed to someone infected with the variant, 15.1 percent became infected, whereas those exposed to someone infected with other strains had a 9.8 percent infection rate. That difference suggests the variant is more contagious, but PHE says it needs more data to confirm this.
PHE’s data mirror the findings in a separate study, published to a preprint server last week and not yet peer reviewed, that estimated that the variant, known as B.1.1.7 or VOC 202012/01, is 56 percent more transmissible but not more severe or lethal than other variants.
Of the 17 mutations found in the variant, eight are in the segment of the virus’s genome that codes for the spike protein that protrudes from the virus and allows it to bind to cellular receptors and infiltrate cells, according to a preliminary report on the variant published December 18. Some scientists theorize these mutations may explain its enhanced transmissibility.
British public health officials first detected B.1.1.7 in September, meaning the variant has had ample time to spread outside the country. Despite having the highest number of recorded cases in the world, the US sequences far fewer SARS-CoV-2 genomes than the UK, leading scientists to suspect that the variant may already have been spreading across the country undetected before yesterday’s announcement. 
Harvard’s Hanage tells the Times that the US would have to improve how it monitors the genetic sequences of viruses to track their spread in real time. “The United States is hobbled by the inconsistency of its approach,” he says. “Unless we turn on the lights, we won’t know it’s there.”
Many scientists say the arrival of B.1.1.7 is a wake-up call. “The lack of virus sequencing and case tracking in the US is a scandal,” University of Massachusetts virologist Jeremy Luban tells the Post.

The pandemic’s toll on the research community
Given the collective pivot the globe took toward addressing the coronavirus pandemic, we’re dedicating a separate post to what we heard from scientists this year—their struggles and triumphs, frustrations and joys.
Aside from research on SARS-CoV-2 itself, the pandemic had huge effects on the scientific community. Tragically, the virus claimed the lives of a number of researchers. Lynika Strozier, whose “hands of gold” could extract DNA from small amounts of starting material and who identified numerous new species, was just 35 when she died of COVID-19. Paleobotanist Brian Axsmith died of COVID-19 at age 57. Paleontologist Robert Carroll, former Stanford University President Donald Kennedy, microbiologist Paul Matewele, former Babraham Institute Director Michael Wakelam, HIV researcher Gita Ramjee, and vascular biologist Stephen Schwartz were also among the 1.6 million people who have died from the disease this year.
While a considerable proportion of researchers found themselves struggling to do their work at times this year, others found themselves laid off or furloughed. Women in STEM appear to have taken the greatest hit to their productivity. Academic job opportunities shrunk and don’t seem to have recovered to the hiring levels of past years. 
Nevertheless, a survey of scientists has found the community resilient in the face of lockdowns and other restrictions, and the astounding accomplishments in the development of drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and research techniques related to the coronavirus are a testament to researchers’ creativity and dedication. Scientists managed to keep their science afloat by turning their homes into wet labs and finding new ways to be productive. Scientific conferences went from cancelled or postponed to completely revamped as virtual events, with broadened inclusivity and fewer carbon emissions from travel.
The world still turned, and burned

With all eyes on SARS-CoV-2, it was easy to overlook other big events unleashed by mother nature. Wildfires burned up and down the US West Coast. In California, blazes damaged field sites and threatened astronomical observatories. And on the other side of the globe, in Australia, efforts to shore up vulnerable koala populations suffered, perhaps irreparably. “There’s been so much research progress in recent years to try and improve the health status of these koala populations,” Natasha Speight, a koala disease researcher and veterinarian at the University of Adelaide in South Australia, told The Scientist in January. “It really is a setback to have so many lost from these bushfires.”
Similarly, a park in Argentina where a long-term study of 20 groups of resident howler monkeys had been ongoing for decades saw at least five groups perish in fires this fall. “All these groups that we found, I knew everything about them. I knew who was the son, the daughter, the mother. The first [few days] I was crying all the time,” Martin Kowalewski, a primate ecologist and the director of the Estación Biológica Corrientes field station, told The Scientist. The fires were thought to have been started intentionally by ranchers to stimulate grassland growth, but they then burned out of control, decimating the reserve where the monkeys lived.
Mitochondria in circulation

In February, scientists reported that they had found functioning mitochondria in people’s blood. Past studies had shown that mitochondrial DNA could be found in circulation, and at times the organelles might get released from cells in response to damage, but entire, respiring organelles in the blood of healthy individuals was a novel observation.
“The whole thing surprises me,” Joel Riley, who studies how mitochondria can stimulate inflammation at the University of Glasgow and wasn’t involved in the study, told The Scientist at the time. “We know that bits of mitochondria can get kicked out of cells through extracellular vesicles [when they are damaged], but whole mitochondria—that’s pretty cool.” The next step is to figure out what the organelles are doing in circulation.

M. VALSTAR ET AL., RADIOTHERAPY & ONCOLOGY, DOI:10.1016/J.RADONC.2020.09.034, 2020.  
Humans continue to be full of anatomical surprises, and this year researchers added to our known components a set of salivary glands in the neck that they named the tubarial glands. The tissue, tucked behind the pharynx, likely went unnoticed because it is difficult to reach during surgery and was discovered with a combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) that uses a radioactive tracer that binds to a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Ordinarily, PSMA PET/CT is used to detect prostate cancer, but lead scientist Wouter Vogel, a radiation oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, told The Scientist in October, “This scan is extremely sensitive for the salivary glands. So we can see more than ever before.”
Inclusivity gains in STEM
© ISTOCK.COM, VICTORIABAR
Although a perennial problem, a lack of equity in STEM gained renewed attention in 2020 as scientists advocated for inclusion, anti-racist action, and awareness of the forces that turn away people from underrepresented groups. Black in X, a collection of initiatives to raise the profile of Black scientists in various fields and support their careers, emerged after a racist incident in May between a Black birder and a white woman who wasn’t following a canine leash law in New York City’s Central Park. Black in Neuro, Black in Astro, Black in Chem, and other groups have since organized virtual events and digital networking. “Now that we can finally see each other, we can now support each other,” Black in Micro co-organizer Ariangela Kozik, a postdoc at the University of Michigan, told The Scientist.
This year, several academic journals also came to recognize that their name-change policies could be harming transgender individuals. Cell Press, for instance, adopted a new policy that allows authors to change the name on their publications. It still requires issuing a correction, with the author’s approval, which can reveal more information than authors might wish to provide. Theresa Tanenbaum, a computer scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has worked on name-change guidance for journals, told The Scientist she advocates for publishers keeping a private record of name changes that would be released only when needed, such as in a legal case.
Alzheimer’s blood test

The first blood test to sample for blood biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer’s disease became available for physicians in October. C2N Diagnostics’s test measures the ratio of two isoforms of the amyloid-β protein, Aβ42 and Aβ40, and the presence of isoforms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) associated with Alzheimer’s risk. “If you asked me [five or ten] years ago if there would ever be a blood test for Alzheimer’s, I would have been very skeptical,” Howard Fillit, the executive director and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, which invested in C2N’s development of the test, told The Scientist. “So the fact that this is on the market now is just amazing.”  
Neanderthal DNA in Africans
© ISTOCK.COM, OLENA YEPIFANOVA
Because modern humans’ interbreeding with Neanderthals took place in Eurasia thousands of years ago, geneticists had assumed that individuals with African ancestry wouldn’t have much Neanderthal DNA in their genomes. Not so. In a study that came out in January, researchers compared African genomes to the Neanderthal reference genome and found a lot more overlap than they had expected—about 17 megabases. 
This is still just one-third of what’s found in the genomes of people with European and Asian ancestry, and likely represents the migration of people from Europe and Asia who carried with them to Africa the genetic legacy of their ancestors’ intermingling with Neanderthals.
Janet Kelso, a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology who was not involved in the study, told The Scientist at the time, “What’s surprising here is the amount. It’s actually a larger proportion than I think people had imagined.”

Much of the world became aware of the disease now known as COVID-19 in January, and impressively, a diagnostic PCR test became available the same month. We’ve since seen an explosion in potential variations on that assay, including saliva tests, which bypass the need for scarce swabs, and a slew of techniques that could be considerably faster and cheaper than PCR, including breath tests, at-home antigen tests, a diagnostic that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR, and even an AI model that detects telltale signs of COVID-19 from CT scans.
New paths in vaccine development
© ISTOCK.COM, SERHEII YAKOVLIEV
While diagnostics gave us hard numbers on SARS-CoV-2’s devastating sweep, the rapid development of vaccines against it allowed us to imagine the pandemic coming under control. mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna were among the early leaders of the vaccine race, training the spotlight on a newer technique that had been attempted for other diseases but had not yet made it to the market before 2020. The principle is to deliver a stretch of viral mRNA to recipients’ cells, which go on to manufacture viral proteins from the transcripts, provoking an immune response.
The year also saw researchers experimenting with other innovative ways of producing vaccines. In one example—which, unlike with mRNA vaccines, would avoid the need for cold temperatures during transport and storage—researchers showed that a flu vaccine delivered orally as a thin film induced an immune response in mice.

STEVE GONG
Collecting data on humans’ brain activity typically requires researchers to put their subjects into expensive MRI or PET scanners, or to affix wires to their skulls for a traditional EEG setup. But advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology—much of it made with an eye toward the consumer market for devices that could be used for applications such as gaming—hold the potential for neuroscientists to gather a wealth of brain activity information as subjects go about their daily activities. The field continued to advance this year with the release of two new BCI headsets, NextMind, which decodes visual attention, and the Neurosity Notion 2, an upgraded iteration of a product that, while designed for coders, can also be used to collect research data.
Those We Lost in 2020/-/For a complete list of our obituaries, see here.
Jeff McKnight (1984–2020)
LAURA MCKNIGHT
Jeff McKnight, a molecular biologist at the University of Oregon, died in October at the age of 36. 
McKnight’s research focused on chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins that controls when and how DNA can be accessed for replication and gene expression. He was one of the earliest researchers in the world capable of directly manipulating its structure, stemming back to his postdoctoral work at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When he had started his own lab in 2016, McKnight said at the time that his “real dream” was to apply his work to the dozens of human diseases that involve some level of chromatin disruption, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s. 
Prior to his death from lymphoma, McKnight had spent months chronicling his diagnosis and treatment on social media, prompting an outpouring of support from fellow scientists. “He had this humility and vulnerability about him that was really endearing,” David Garcia, a molecular biologist at the University of Oregon, told The Scientist.
Lynika Strozier (1985–2020)
KYLE FLUBACKER
Biologist Lynika Strozier, a researcher at the Field Museum and an instructor at Malcom X College, died June 7 at age 35 due to complications associated with COVID-19.
After being introduced to molecular biology as an undergraduate at Truman College, Strozier developed a passion for using DNA to identify new and sometimes cryptic species. For her thesis work as a master’s student at Loyola University, Strozier sequenced DNA from 200 individual birds in Madagascar thought to belong to three species. Instead, she identified several new species that were indistinguishable based only on the birds’ appearance.
Her steady hand and aptitude in extracting usable genetic material from old samples earned the admiration of her colleagues. “Our entire team entrusted Lynika with extracting DNA from old dried plant material of over 15 years and only very little material from which to do so,” Matt Von Konrat, the head of botanical collections at the Field Museum, told The Scientist.
Stanley Cohen (1922–2020)
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER
Nobel laureate and biochemist Stanley Cohen, who led pioneering studies of cell growth factors, died in February. He was 97.
“Stan’s work not only provided key insights into how cells grow, but it led to the development of many drugs that are used to treat cancer,” Lawrence Marnett, the dean of basic sciences at Vanderbilt University, where Cohen taught for 40 years, said to The Tennessean. 
Cohen’s work on different types of growth factors alongside biochemist Rita Levi-Montalcini earned them the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Cohen was honored for his discovery of epidermal growth factor—a protein that stimulates cell growth and differentiation and plays an important role in tumor development—while Levi-Montalcini was acknowledged for first isolating nerve growth factor. Growth factor receptors have since become the target of numerous drugs, such as gefitinib and cetuximab, that slow or prevent the progression of certain cancers.
Angelika Amon (1967–2020)
SAMARA VISE, KOCH INSTITUTE AT MIT
Angelika Amon, a cell biologist at MIT, died on October 29 from ovarian cancer at the age of 53.
Amon dedicated her career to researching the cell cycle and how disruptions to its normal function can lead to cancer. 
During her PhD at the University of Vienna and her subsequent postdoc at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Amon used model organisms such as yeast and fruit flies to study how certain proteins and enzymes direct cells through mitosis.
Later, Amon turned her focus to the study of aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, and chromosome segregation. She found that extra chromosomes disrupt protein folding and cell metabolism, leading to errors in those processes that can drive cancer. 
“More than anyone else I’ve ever met, she was an absolute force of nature,” Matthew Vander Heiden, an MIT biologist and close friend of Amon, told The Scientist. “She just has this larger than life personality—there’s no other way to put it.”
James Taylor (1979–2020)
WILL KIRK/JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
Computational biologist James Taylor, who developed a widely used bioinformatics platform, died in April. He was 40.
“James made huge contributions to open-source, accessibility, and reproducibility,” genomicist Andrew Carroll tweeted following his death. “Anyone who runs a bioinformatics tool on the cloud does so thanks to James’s work.” 
During his PhD at Penn State University, Taylor helped develop the Galaxy Project, a platform that allows researchers to share genomic data without needing to know how to program. He continued refining the platform as he moved from teaching at Emory University to Johns Hopkins University, and since then Galaxy has been used in more than 10,000 publications across disciplines. Prior to his death, Taylor spoke on Twitter of the need “to make transparent, reusable and reproducible analysis pipelines” to address the current pandemic, by developing resources for best practices in sharing and analyzing data.
William Dement (1928–2020)
ED SOUZA/STANFORD NEWS SERVICE
Sleep scientist William Dement, who described a number of sleep disorders and opened one of the world’s first sleep disorder clinics, died in June. He was 91. 
During his graduate studies at the University of Chicago in the 1950’s, Dement studied the physiology of REM sleep and its relationship to dreaming. He later joined the faculty at Stanford University, where he taught for 50 years. There, his focus became the study of sleep apnea and the effects of sleep deprivation. In 1970, he launched the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center and is credited with prompting Congress to establish the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research.
“There are not a lot of people who can say they saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people,” Emmanuel Mignot, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, said in an obituary. “But just by pushing this field forward, making sleep apnea recognized, as well as sleep disorders and sleep deprivation, Bill did that.”
Wendy Havran (1955–2020)
WENDY HAVRAN
Wendy Havran, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute who studied the role of gamma-delta T cells in wound healing, died January 20 at the age of 64.
Havran first became interested in immunology after meeting John Cambier, an immunologist at Duke University, where she completed her undergraduate degree. While she had intended to study medicine, she became enamored of doing research. “It just clicked, and there was no going back,” she told The Scientist in a 2019 profile. “I wanted to understand how the immune system worked.” 
During her doctorate research at the University of Chicago, Havran used monoclonal antibodies  to study CD4 and CD8 surface markers on T cells. Later, as a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, Havran began focusing specifically on gamma-delta T cells, which had only just been described. She was able to map their abundance throughout the body, showing for the first time that they were common in the skin and intestines. In her own lab at Scripps, Havran went on to demonstrate the cells’ ability to heal wounds and suppress tumor growth.
Noel Rose (1927–2020)
JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
Immunologist and microbiologist Noel Rose, whose early experiments established the concept of autoimmunity, died of a stroke on July 30 at the age of 92.
Before his pioneering work, it was believed that the body was incapable of launching an immune response against itself. But as a young medical student at the University of Buffalo, Rose showed that rabbits injected with their own thyroid-derived antigens mounted an immune response that damaged or destroyed the animals’ thyroid. Over the next several decades, he would further unravel the causes and mechanisms of autoimmune diseases, publishing more than 880 articles and book chapters. 
“In every aspect, [Rose] is the father of autoimmunity,” George Tsokos, a professor of rheumatology at Harvard Medical School, told The Scientist in a profile of Rose. “The man opened a whole chapter in the book of medicine.” 
Philip Leder (1934–2020)
LIZA GREEN, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL
Phillip Leder, a molecular geneticist at Harvard Medical School whose research furthered the fields of molecular biology, immunology, and cancer genetics, died in February. He was 85. 
Working alongside NIH geneticist Marshall Nirenberg as a postdoc in the 1960s, Leder developed a technique that confirmed, for the first time, that amino acids were encoded by three nucleotides. Speaking in a 2012 interview, he recalled the excitement of those early experiments. “I would go to bed thinking about the next day’s experiments and then jump out of bed in the morning and rush to the laboratory. It was a lot of work, but the intellectual excitement was enormous.”
Having revealed the genetic basis of protein coding, Leder next went on to map the first complete sequence of a mammalian gene, develop the first recombinant DNA vector system, and discover a cancer-causing gene that led to the development of the first mouse model of cancer, among other achievements. He established the genetics department at Harvard Medical School in 1981 only a year after joining the faculty and served as chair for 25 years.
“Phil Leder was special. Among great scientists, he was special, and among scientists, he was an icon,” David Livingston, a geneticist at Harvard, told The Scientist.
Flossie Wong-Staal (1946–2020)
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO
Molecular virologist Flossie Wong-Staal, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), who first cloned the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), died in July at age 73 due to complications from pneumonia.
When Wong-Staal first entered the laboratory of fellow virologist Robert Gallo as a postdoc in 1973, scientists were skeptical that retroviruses could cause cancer in humans. Wong-Staal’s work helped to overturn this dogma after she and her team identified the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) and showed that it could indeed lead to cancer. Together, she and Gallo published more than 100 papers in 20 years, making Wong-Staal the most-cited woman in science during the 1980s.
As AIDS cases began to spike in the 1980s, Wong-Staal became the first person to clone HIV— the retrovirus that causes the disease—and began studying the functions of its genes, a necessary step towards developing eventual treatments. She left Gallo’s lab at the National Cancer Institute in 1990 to launch the Center for AIDS Research at UCSD, where she spent the next several decades studying the virus and developing treatments, many of which are still in use today.
New SARS-CoV-2 Variant Spreading Rapidly in UK/-/Update (December 21): More than 40 countries have restricted UK arrivals while experts continue to investigate the implications of the variant. Oxford University epidemiologist Peter Horby, who chairs the UK New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, tells a Science Media Centre briefing on Monday, “We now have high confidence that this variant does have a transmission advantage.” Despite the new findings, epidemiologists tell The New York Times that mutations are to be expected and that it would take a matter of years, not months, for a strain to evolve enough to render the current vaccines ineffective.

A
s public health officials worldwide mount vaccination campaigns against COVID-19, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant has rapidly taken hold in the UK, leading scientists to investigate if it carries any implications for the transmissibility of the virus, severity of infection, and success of a vaccine, though experts say it is unlikely to hamper vaccination efforts. 
As of December 13, 1,108 COVID-19 cases with the new variant had been identified, predominantly in the south and east of England, says Public Health England in a statement on Monday (December 14). “High numbers of cases of the variant virus have been observed in some areas where there is also a high incidence of COVID-19,” the statement notes. “It is not yet known whether the variant is responsible for these increased numbers of cases.”
“We are still dealing with very thin evidence at the moment about this variant,” Sharon Peacock, the director of the UK COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK), which randomly sequences positive COVID-19 samples around from the UK and discovered this variant, tells The Independent. 
The group first identified the new variant in late September and began following its spread, but what surprised some experts was its sudden prevalence.
“This lineage came up quite rapidly,” Nick Loman, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of Birmingham and a contributor to COG-UK, tells The Washington Post, noting that there were a “striking” number of mutations in the new variant, compared to the one or two he’s seen in other strains. Still, he notes that there is no proof yet that this variant is spreading faster or causing more severe illness.
Scientists detected 17 mutations in the variant, which scientists have named “VUI – 202012/01,” most in the segment of the virus’s genome that codes for the spike protein that surrounds the virus and allows it to bind to cellular receptors and infiltrate cells. 
Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust biomedical research foundation, released a statement on Monday, calling the development “potentially serious,” though he cautioned that the implications for transmission of the virus and the efficacy of vaccines were still unclear.
“The pressure on the virus to evolve is increased by the fact that so many millions of people have now been infected,” he says. “Most of the mutations will not be significant or cause for concern, but some may give the virus an evolutionary advantage, which may lead to higher transmission or mean it is more harmful.”
COG-UK scientists stress that mutations are very common and that lineages arise and disappear quickly, according to a statement the group released on Monday. 
There are few examples of the variant in other countries and it “does sort of seem to have come out of nowhere,” Loman tells The Independent.
This variant is not the first that scientists have detected in the novel coronavirus—the 614G variant that contains a spike protein mutation overtook the 614D variant in the spring. The mutation does not appear to cause more severe cases of COVID-19, but multiple studies indicate that it could be more contagious.
In the fall, another variant that scientists feared could be less sensitive to antibodies took hold in mink farms, leading several countries to call for the culling of millions of minks to prevent the variant from spreading to humans.
Even as the virus mutates, experts are quick to point out that it’s unlikely that it would mutate in such a way that would render a vaccine ineffective. “It seems hard to see that this virus is going to be able to evolve its way away from vaccine efficacy,” Egon Ozer, an infectious diseases expert at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, tells the Post.
The Top Retractions of 2020/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WWING
A
s 2020 was the year of the pandemic, COVID-19 loomed large in the world of retractions, too. According to our tracker in early December, 39 articles about the novel coronavirus have been retracted from preprint servers or peer-reviewed journals so far—a number we’re confident will grow. (That number does not include the retraction of an article from a Johns Hopkins student newspaper claiming that COVID-19 has had “relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.”) That’s out of a total of more than 1,650 retractions catalogued to date in 2020. Here are our picks for the most significant pandemic-related retractions:
1
The most spectacular flameouts involved a pair of articles that appeared in two of the world’s most prestigious medical journals. Both The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine were forced to remove articles that relied on data from a questionable firm called Surgisphere, which refused to share its results with coauthors and the editors involved. (The Lancet also retracted and replaced an editorial it had published that had cited the ill-fated paper.) Before it was discredited, the paper in The Lancet had tremendous influence, leading to the suspension of clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine. A third, influential Surgisphere study was taken down from the SSRN server at the request of a coauthor. The withdrawal of the preprint, which was about potential benefits of the antiparasitic drug ivermection, received little fanfare, let alone a retraction notice.

Although The Lancet article’s conclusions on hydroxychloroquine were ultimately disregarded, numerous studies to follow determined that the drug is ineffective against COVID-19. The dubious therapy, which President Donald Trump boasted of having taken, was also the subject of this preprint, which was withdrawn in May—but not before the Fox TV personality Laura Ingraham touted the study, as did Didier Raoult, the French scientist whose work with hydroxy early in the pandemic sparked widespread, if misguided, optimism about its use. A version of the paper that relied much less heavily on hydroxychloroquine in its conclusions was published in October in a special issue of a journal that Raoult edited. (So far, none of Raoult’s papers on the drug have been retracted, although an Elsevier-commissioned review of one of them found it to have “major methodological shortcomings” and be “fully irresponsible.” He did have an obviously unrelated 2013 paper retracted this year from PLOS ONE for suspicious images.)

Hydroxychloroquine also was at the heart of a clever “sting” operation by a pair of researchers in Europe who were alarmed by what they believed to be predatory behavior by the Asian Journal of Medicine and Health (AJMH), which had published a roundly criticized paper heralding the drug. They published a sham paper in the AJMH purporting to find that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was “unexpectedly deadlier than push-scooters,” and that hydroxychloroquine might be the “unique solution.” The journal reacted indignantly to being called out, retracting the hoax article, but left the initial paper intact—which was fine with the jokesters, one of whom told us, “yes the article deserves to be withdrawn—but it should NEVER have been published in the first place, that’s the beauty of the story.”

The same week as the Lancet and NEJM Surgisphere retractions, the Annals of Internal Medicine backtracked on a highly-cited paper it published in April that purported to find that masks were ineffective at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The article, which became a media—and social media—star, was woefully light on data, based in fact on just four subjects.
5
If lack of data was a problem for some papers, others suffered from a complete lack of common sense. Like this article, which claimed that COVID-19 resulted from 5G telecom energy. The quickly retracted paper earned the title of the “worst paper of 2020” from data-sleuth Elisabeth Bik.
6
In the category of “not retracted but should never have been published,” we’ll offer up this book chapter, which claims that the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic hitched a ride to Earth on a meteorite.
7
Sticking with fantastical thinking, Science of the Total Environment must have been in that headspace when it published this paper claiming that wearing amulets could ward off COVID-19 (pro tip: they don’t). After an uproar on Twitter, the coauthors of the article called for its retraction, although the journal has yet to definitively remove—or replace—the work.
8
PLOS ONE issued an expression of concern for a paper it published in September suggesting that vitamin D might protect against severe COVID-19. The move came after criticism on Twitter by Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist in Sydney who pointed out, among other issues, that the study relied on a small number of patients and appeared to show a null result.
9
After a preprint they relied on for epidemiological data from China was withdrawn, researchers at Imperial College London corrected a paper that, in the words of The Washington Post, “helped upend U.S. and U.K. coronavirus strategies.” The study projected that COVID-19 would kill half a million people in the UK, and more than 2 million in the US, if restrictions were not put into place, which prompted the UK government to implement social distancing and isolation measures. The authors told us they were confident that data available later had affirmed their overall findings.
10
Cellular & Molecular Immunology took three days to accept a paper about how COVID-19 might infect white blood cells—similar to HIV’s strategy—and then took three months to retract it after a researcher sent them a letter critiquing the study. The critic, Leonardo Ferreira, tweeted that “no primary #human #Tcells were used & the #flowcytometry data for #viral #infection were egregiously misinterpreted.” In the time before it was retracted, according to Altmetric, it earned coverage in New York magazine and other mainstream outlets, and was the subject of thousands of tweets. 
It wasn’t all COVID-19
1
Some journals used 2020 to purge what readers perceived to be offensive articles. In June, the venerable German title Angewandte Chemie retracted (without saying as much, until later) an essay by Brock University researcher Tomáš Hudlický, which lamented efforts to diversify his field. Sixteen members of the journal’s editorial board resigned in protest, and two were suspended.
2
The Journal of Vascular Surgery found itself in hot water after publishing an article arguing that physicians who posted pictures of themselves in casual clothes or bathing suits were acting in a “potentially unprofessional” manner. The essay, panned as out of touch and misogynistic, triggered the #medbikini movement on Twitter—and, eventually, an apology from the journal. 
3
Among the authors of the 5G–COVID-19 paper was Massimo Fioranelli, whose name also appeared on five other now-retracted articles in a special issue of the Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences devoted to global dermatology. One of those asserted that “A black hole at the center of earth plays the role of the biggest system of telecommunication for connecting DNAs, dark DNAs and molecules of water on 4+N- dimensional manifold.”
4
One notable case was that of Jonathan Pruitt, a scientist in Canada who studies the sociology of spiders. Earlier this year, one of Pruitt’s coauthors became concerned about the veracity of his data, setting off an investigation that has led to eight retractions and counting.
5
The Pruitt case was one of at least a few examples in which affected scientists publicized their retractions widely, in a refreshing move. “I’m starting the year off with something I didn’t expect to ever do: I’m retracting a paper,” Kate Laskowski, a Pruitt coauthor, announced on her blog. And Nobel Prize winner Frances Arnold of Caltech announced a retraction from Science before the retraction notice was even published.

Key Genes Related to Severe COVID-19 Infection Identified/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

ore than a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected, researchers are still trying to understand why some people infected with the virus become critically ill, while others have little to no symptoms. Scientists have turned to look at the genes of patients with severe COVID-19 to understand if their bodies mount an immune defense differently than healthy patients do. A genome-wide association study published in Nature on December 11 finds that variants of five key genes responsible for antiviral immunity and lung inflammation are associated with severe COVID-19. 
The findings offer potential therapeutic targets to create an effective COVID-19 treatment. “Our results immediately highlight which drugs should be at the top of the list for clinical testing,” Kenneth Baillie, a consultant in critical care medicine and a senior research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, tells Reuters. 
Baillie and his colleagues analyzed the DNA of 2,244 patients across 208 UK intensive care units and compared it to matched controls who did not have a positive COVID-19 PCR test on file. They identified eight loci where variants were more common among the intensive care patients, of which five were in genes linked to the immune system—IFNAR2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9, and CCR2.
See “The Immune Hallmarks of Severe COVID-19”
An analysis looking into the relationship between the activity of certain genes and severe COVID-19 pointed to a lower expression of IFNAR2, a gene that encodes a building block of a receptor for interferons, which act as emergency flares to warn the immune system of an intruder and have been a target for researchers hoping to develop a COVID-19 treatment. However, administering interferon to hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not reduce mortality, according to a large clinical trial published earlier this month.
The researchers also homed in on a possible link between severe COVID-19 and higher expression levels of TYK2 and CCR2, which encode proteins used in cytokine signaling, which drives inflammation and can lead to lung injury. The anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib, typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, inhibits the protein encoded by the TYK2 gene and has shown promising results in treating COVID-19 when paired with remdesivir, a broad spectrum antiviral that has shown limited effectiveness against the virus by itself, according to a study published December 11 in The New England Journal of Medicine.
See “AI Is Screening Billions of Molecules for Coronavirus Treatments”
While the Nature study may offer clues for the genetic underpinnings of severe COVID-19 infection, finding an effective treatment in humans may still be years away. “There is no guarantee that when a gene is found, targeting that gene will result in therapeutic efficacy,” Tom Hemming Karlsen, a physician at the University of Oslo who did not participate in the new work, tells The Washington Post. “What genetics studies like this then do is they help us find very specific starting points” for further investigation.
The authors' investigation indicated that there is a causal role for IFNAR2 and TYK2. Sara Clohisey, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh and a coauthor of the Nature study, notes that there are likely many other factors beyond these gene variants that contribute to COVID-19 disease severity.
“A chunk of the answer is in our genes,” but “it’s unlikely that a single element is fully responsible for the development of severe COVID-19,” she tells the Post. “It’s more likely to be a combination of factors,” which may include genetics as well as age, obesity, gender, and other characteristics.
Correction (December 15): A previous version of this article misinterpreted Sara Clohisey's comments about the causality of her findings. The Scientist regrets the error.
Conference Linked to as Many as 300,000 COVID-19 Cases: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

T
he United States had its first coronavirus superspreader event during a two-day conference in Boston organized by the biotech company Biogen in February. Genetic testing has revealed that what began with 99 people who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the event, another 205,000–300,000 cases subsequently resulted as the attendees returned home to 29 states and several other countries, carrying the virus with them, according to a study published in Science on December 10. 
A national database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and contact tracing has allowed the authors to track which strains were being transmitted. As The Boston Globe reports, the proportion of the pandemic attributed to the conference is roughly 1.6 percent of all US COVID-19 cases. 
By performing genetic analyses from 28 of the infected conference-goers, researchers were able to identify the viral strain that circulated among them and that then spread around the country. They found that the strain from the conference hadn’t been seen in the US before that, only in France.
The conference was held February 26 and 27, weeks before any state declared stay-at-home orders or other measures to curb COVID-19 transmission. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, there were only three presumptive cases in the first week of March and the state’s Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel said at the time that there was low risk in Massachusetts.
“It’s a cautionary tale,” Bronwyn MacInnis, a genomic epidemiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a coauthor of the paper, tells The New York Times. “When we hear these stories of clusters where 20 or 50 or 100 were affected, that does not account for what happens after.”
Soon after the cluster of cases was tied to the event in the spring, Biogen partnered with the Broad Institute to create a biobank to learn as much as possible about COVID-19 through blood samples from Biogen employees and their close contacts. The company has maintained a presence in COVID-19 research.
See “Biogen Uses its Own Superspreader Event to Aid COVID-19 Research”
“Tremendous progress has been made since the start of the pandemic to gain a better understanding of this novel virus and its transmission, develop vaccines, and investigate potential treatment options,” reads a Biogen statement to the Globe, following the publication of the study. “As a company rooted in science, we understand the value of the data that came from the first wave of the pandemic in the Boston area and we hope that information gleaned from these data will help continue to drive a better understanding of the transmission of this virus and efforts to address it.”
The authors expressed in various news reports that while the strain is unique, it isn’t more virulent than others.
“The conditions that allow these super-spreading events to occur are very much still with us and will continue to be with us for a long time,” lead author Jacob Lemieux of the Broad Institute tells the Times, warning about the upcoming holidays. “Maintain social distancing, wear masks whenever possible and avoid indoor gatherings.”
Study Estimates 76 Percent of Brazilian City Exposed to SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DANIEL FIGUERIEDO
I
n a study published in Science December 8, a group of researchers estimate that 76 percent of the population of Manaus, the first Brazilian city to be hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, could have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far, based on antibodies present in samples from blood banks. The report also estimates that in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, that percentage is much lower, accounting for 29 percent of the population. According to the paper, these results highlight the failure of Manaus to control the spread of the virus. 
The findings are based on the analysis of samples from donor blood centers. Because Brazilian law establishes that blood banks should keep samples for six months, the researchers were able to go back in time and trace the unravelling of the pandemic between February and October. In the case of Manaus, they observed that the proportion of blood donors with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was around 5 percent in April, but increased steeply to almost 40 percent in May. After adjusting the results for age and sex, for the sensitivity of the test, and for the decay in antibodies in the samples, the researchers extrapolate that by June, 66.2 percent of the population had been infected, a figure that rose to 76 percent by October. An average of around 900 to 1,000 samples were analyzed for each month and city.
“The sixty-six percent figure sets the theoretical threshold for herd immunity, but cases are still increasing in Manaus,” says Ester Sabino, an immunologist at the University of São Paulo and lead author of the study.
An early version of the paper, uploaded to a preprint repository in September, stated that the high presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population meant that Manaus would have achieved herd immunity. The manuscript was met with fierce backlash by part of the medical and scientific community, who considered that such a claim could make the population take fewer precautions and could be used by politicians to lift restrictions. Just a few days after the preprint came out, the city experienced a second wave of cases after a period of stability. While both events happened too close in time to be causally connected, the paper may have contributed to a delay in the response and a failure to acknowledge the severity of the situation, according to news outlet Amazonia Real.
With COVID-19 cases continuing to be very high in Manaus, and nearly all intensive care unit beds currently occupied, there is clearly a substantial amount of the population still vulnerable.
To address this criticism, the peer-reviewed version of the study has downplayed the statements referring to herd immunity, noting that “prior infection might not confer long-lasting immunity.”
“It looked like we had said that by reaching herd immunity the epidemic was over, but that was not what we meant, so we rewrote the text to try to improve that,” says Sabino.
Located in the heart of the Amazon forest, hundreds of miles away from the country’s economic and political centers, Manaus is an industrial city with a population of more than 2 million. 
Since the pandemic started, the city has had more than 73,000 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 and some 3,000 deaths, according to official figures. However, experts agree that the real figures are probably much higher, as few tests are performed. The shocking photographs of mass graves in the city’s cemetery back in April were some of the earliest graphic testimonies of the severity of the pandemic. According to a study published in a Brazilian journal, the number of total deaths in Manaus in April was more than 4.5 times higher than in previous years.
Extrapolation from blood donors
All the experts who spoke with The Scientist agree that the main limitation of this new study is that blood bank donors are not representative of the total population. The researchers adjusted for some of the demographic skew in the sample by comparing it to the population census, but the approach is far from perfect.
Jesem Orellana, an epidemiologist from Manaus who works at the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, a public research institution, notes the prospect of a free COVID-19 test upon donating blood may have prompted specific groups of people to contribute.
“Many people may have donated blood to know their serological status, especially those who suspected they had been infected and with less financial resources,” Orellana says. He adds that the blood center even partnered with Uber to offer a discount to donors heading to the facility. All of this might have influenced the outcome of the study.
See “Researchers in Brazil Struggle to Get Solid COVID-19 Death Counts”
Another challenge for the researchers was dealing with antibody waning. The kit used in the study was able to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 fairly well if the patient had been infected recently. But as weeks passed, the signal became weaker and more difficult to identify, according to the study.
To overcome this, the authors developed a mathematical model to correct for cases that were likely positive based on a weak antibody signal, but overlooked by the assay. This proved especially important for the samples from Manaus, as most infections appear to have happened in the early days of the pandemic, around April. People who were infected in April or May, but donated in September or October, had by then experienced a decay in the number of antibodies, which made it difficult for the researchers to identify these cases as positive.
In São Paulo, where the infection curve was more contained, this correction wasn’t so relevant for the calculation, according to the authors, as the antibody waning from old infections was compensated by new infections.
The pandemic in Manaus
In Manaus, the study has been received with skepticism by the scientific and medical communities. The extensive media coverage that the early September version of the study received, filled with claims that the city had reached herd immunity, made it increasingly difficult for health officials to convey the need for keeping restrictions and social distance measures. Political decisions in the region, such as reopening schools, were influenced by the study, according to the magazine Época. So while the new version of the study puts less weight on herd immunity, many still worry that the paper may do more harm than good.
Cristiano Fernandes, the technical director of the Fundação Vigilância e Saúde do Amazonas, a department of the State Health Secretariat that has been at the frontline of the pandemic response, criticizes the paper’s repeated use of the term “unmitigated” to refer to how the pandemic unfolded in the city.
“Saying that Manaus did not have a mitigation plan to restrain the disease is just not true. To make such a claim was inelegant and unnecessary, to say the least,” says Fernandes, who notes that there might have been other factors that contributed to the severity of the pandemic in Manaus.
One of the factors pointed out by Fernandes is the existence of at least eight different strains of the new coronavirus circulating in the state where Manaus is located. This suggests that the virus arrived through multiple paths, which could have amplified the development of the pandemic in the city.
According to several researchers who spoke with The Scientist, the city’s precarious health system may have also played a role in the pandemic response. Despite its size and wealth, Manaus has few intensive care unit beds, which serve not only the city, but the whole state of Amazonas, an area which is approximately 3.5 times bigger than California.
“Manaus absorbed a high load [of patients] from the municipalities in the interior [of the state], where there is no appropriate health infrastructure,” says Felipe Naveca, an epidemiologist at the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz who was critical of the new study. “There are still many questions and few reliable answers.”
A previous study using serological household surveys estimated that in June, 14 percent of the population had been infected—much lower than the 66.2 percent figure found in this new study for that month. While the household survey also has some limitations, the disparity between the studies calls for caution in interpreting the results.
Microbiologist Natalia Pasternak, the director of the Instituto Questão de Ciencia, a private organization that promotes scientific integrity and has been monitoring the pandemic in Brazil since its early days, describes the study in a positive light. However, she warns that the 76 percent figure should be seen as an estimate. With COVID-19 cases continuing to be very high in Manaus, and nearly all intensive care unit beds currently occupied, there is clearly a substantial amount of the population still vulnerable.
“I think we need to stress that herd immunity will only be achieved through vaccines,” says Pasternak.

AI-Assisted Cough Tracking Could Help Detect the Next Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

hen Joe Brew worked for the Florida Department of Health as an epidemiologist for two years starting in 2013, he helped with syndromic surveillance, meaning he had the arduous job of reviewing the symptoms of patients coming into the emergency departments from all across the state. The goal of such work: to detect an abnormal spike of symptoms in an area that may indicate there’s a public health concern. 
Public health authorities worldwide continue to use this type of surveillance. The outbreak of a novel pathogen in Wuhan, China in late 2019, for instance, was in part detected by a large uptick of patients coming to the hospital with symptoms of a respiratory infection, with unknown etiology. But Brew says this system fails to prevent the transmission of a virus like SARS-CoV-2 because by the time patients arrive at the hospital, they have likely already been infectious for a matter of days. COVID-19 tests, too, often fail to return a result in time for patients to properly isolate while they’re infectious.
This realization led Brew to turn to a device that billions have in their pockets—a smartphone—to provide public health authorities with real-time symptomatic data from the community. Brew and several colleagues founded Hyfe, a free phone application that uses artificial intelligence to detect and track users’ coughs, a hallmark of many respiratory conditions including COVID-19. 
Cough has long been a symptom that physicians record, yet the method for monitoring it is typically limited to a self-report during a clinic visit.
“The way you beat COVID is by acting fast—by being ahead of it,” says Brew, who is now the CEO of Hyfe. “Those places that very quickly identified clusters and outbreaks were able to shut things down and basically control the pandemic even without a vaccine.”
People who are curious to monitor their cough frequency trends, say, if they have a respiratory condition or want to share these data with loved ones or medical professionals, can download Hyfe onto their smartphones. When the application hears a loud, abrupt noise, such as a cough, it captures that approximately half-second snippet of sound and converts it into a 3-D image called a spectrogram that represents the pitch and intensity of the sound over time. The spectrogram is then processed through a machine learning algorithm known as a convolutional neural network, which has been trained on a dataset of more than 270,000 sounds—a cough, laugh, grunt, burp, or a fork hitting a plate, for example—that two human listeners have labeled as a cough or not a cough that help the algorithm determine whether the abrupt noise was, indeed, a cough. The app also learns an individual’s unique cough, so if the app detects another person’s cough that significantly deviates from their previous coughs, it won’t log it.
Brew and a team of scientists aim to take this concept into the field to see if they can detect an outbreak of an infectious respiratory pathogen. Their pilot project will examine the cough data at a community-wide level in a small municipality on the outskirts of Pamplona, Spain.
A spectrogram, which is a visual representation of audio frequency and intensity over time, that shows an archetypical cough. Hyfe converts snippets of users’ suspected coughs into these images and processes them through a machine learning algorithm to determine whether the sound is a cough.
HYFE
“There’s a lot of people thinking about diagnostics, but everyone is thinking individually,” ISGlobal Barcelona Institute for Global Health epidemiologist Carlos Chaccour, who is leading the study, tells The Scientist. “But so far, the community perspective has not been pursued.”
While Brew admits that there could be many non–infectious disease causes for a cough—air quality, asthma, allergies, fumes from cooking, to name a few—he says the lack of specificity is a feature not a bug. In the case of wastewater surveillance, which is another tool for public health officials to use to indirectly detect and monitor the spread of infectious disease, “you’re already looking for the virus, and you’re already in an epidemic situation,” he says, whereas Hyfe could, in theory, detect a surprise flare-up from an novel disease before it progresses to that point.
The great thing about this cough monitoring is it will be passive—the patient won’t actually have to do anything.
—Alyn Morice, Hull York Medical School
Chaccour and his team have enrolled more than 60 people in the community so far and aim for as many as 500 to test the concept. As part of the study, participants grant researchers access to their hospital records and their Hyfe data to determine if a rise from a baseline level of coughing among the participants correlates to more diagnoses of respiratory conditions, including COVID-19. 
If Hyfe can successfully demonstrate that its detection of a higher community incidence in coughing precedes more respiratory diagnoses in the clinic, Chaccour says, he envisions users could then view a heat map of anonymized data showing which communities have the highest prevalence of coughing—a tool that could come in handy for public health officials but also people hoping to understand the risk of infection in a community.
A missed opportunity
Cough has long been a symptom that physicians record, yet the method for monitoring it is typically limited to a self-report during a clinic visit. Previous research suggests that patients often underreport how much they cough, which has led epidemiologists such as Brew to think that there is untapped potential in using cough data.
Alyn Morice, who is the head of respiratory medicine at Hull York Medical School in the UK and specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of cough, says that patients answering questionnaires are entirely unreliable. He’s even seen patients fabricate data from peak flow meters, portable devices that patients use at home to measure how efficiently air flows through their lungs.
“The great thing about this cough monitoring is it will be passive—the patient won’t actually have to do anything,” he says.
University of Washington infectious disease expert Peter Small, who has advised Hyfe and provided seed funding to the firm when he was the senior health director of global health technologies at Global Good, tells The Scientist he is optimistic about this new frontier of technology, particularly in the context of eradicating tuberculosis. “Patients seek care very late in the disease and part of that is because we, as a society, tend to ignore cough in adults,” he says. 
With the help of AI-assisted cough tracking, he envisions a world in which users who have been coughing at a higher rate than normal for, say, two weeks would receive a text notifying them of their symptoms with directions to a public clinic that can test them for tuberculosis.
Even in patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis, Small says, the technology could show patients’ recovery progress. “I’ve been around a lot of TB patients and it’s a very disconcerting diagnosis,” he says. “Even though it’s almost always curable, it’s psychologically difficult on patients, and having objective evidence that their cough is getting better can help with their spirits.”
Cough counting would have been interesting in 1990, but right now we have some five billion humans carrying a microphone with them at all times every day, everywhere.
—Joe Brew, Hyfe
The Hyfe group is not the only one working to integrate cough into a more effective public health tool. Morice, for instance, developed an alert system using cough tracking through an external monitor users wear around their necks for impending chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations—severe episodes that can often lead to hospitalization. His research team detected 45 percent of these flare-ups an average of four days prior to diagnosis, according to data they presented at this year’s European Respiratory Society virtual conference. With early intervention, patients who take steroids or bronchodilators can prevent or lessen the severity of these exacerbations, Morice says.
“If you’re able to prevent hospital admissions in these folks, it’s much better for the patient but it’s also much better for the health economy because [treating the] exacerbation is an expensive thing,” he says.
An MIT group tried to develop a tool to determine if it’s possible to identify a COVID-19–specific cough. The researchers processed more than 70,000 forced-cough audio samples, of which 2,660 were submitted by people with COVID-19, through a machine learning algorithm, which they claim accurately identifies 98.5 percent of coughs from people who were confirmed to have COVID-19, including 100 percent of forced coughs from those who were asymptomatic, according to their paper published in October in IEEE Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology. 
In other endeavors, researchers are soliciting healthy and COVID-19–infected individuals to help train their AI models to eventually allow users to understand if they have the virus based on their cough. These projects include a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation–funded initiative, Cough Against Covid, at the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai, the University of Cambridge’s COVID-19 Sounds project, and the Coughvid project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne.
Morice remains skeptical of apps that claim they can diagnose users’ coughs: “Frankly, I don’t believe them. You can tell a wet cough from a dry cough, but that’s about it from the cough sounds.” Several coauthors of the MIT study declined requests for an interview to discuss their work.
Brew says he not only wants to better understand the acoustic signature of different ailments, but also track the diurnal pattern of cough—do people with COVID-19, for example, tend to cough more during a certain part of the day or night? “When do they begin coughing? Does a change in cough frequency indicate a certain prognosis?” Brew asks. “These are super basic questions that no one really knows [the answer to] at this point.”
Privacy concerns of recording audio
More than 40 countries and 21 US states and territories use official state-sponsored COVID-19 applications that aid contact tracers in stemming the spread of the virus. Despite the promise of these apps, few people in the US have downloaded them, in part because users worry about handing over their detailed location history to their government, says Chaccour. 
Any app monitoring cough would also require permission to record audio through users’ smartphones and, in Hyfe’s case, track their location to measure cough at a community level. Brew says he hopes to reassure users that the app would only record roughly half-second snippets following an abrupt noise. Still, he says he thinks there needs to be some value offered back to the user. One idea is to design a dashboard of users’ personal data akin to what Fitbit does with step counts. “Nobody cared about step counts 15 years ago until Fitbit made it trendy,” he says.
To Chaccour, if the technology proves useful, the end goal is not to provide it to governments, but perhaps to third-party companies such as Apple or Google, which can integrate it into their phone operating systems. He’s noticed that in Spain, people aren’t very trustful of the official government COVID-19 app, but they don’t mind their phones listening for users to summon the voice assistant or tracking how much they’ve slept.
Brew says he thinks the present moment is a perfect opportunity to roll out the technology. People care about public health and “cough counting would have been interesting in 1990, but right now we have some five billion humans carrying a microphone with them at all times every day, everywhere.”

ome people may have been infected with the novel coronavirus as early as December 13, more than a month before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of the virus, according to a study published online November 30 in Clinical Infectious Diseases, in which researchers analyzed blood samples from American Red Cross donations. The findings provide further evidence that the virus was spreading around the world well before public health officials and researchers thought it had started circulating.
The Red Cross had originally collected the blood samples to test for exposure to mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus and the study authors used them to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, Susan Stramer, an American Red Cross virologist and a coauthor of the paper, tells The New York Times. 
Among the 7,389 samples, 106 had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 39 were collected from California, Oregon, and Washington between December 13 and December 16. Another 67 were collected from Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin between December 30 and January 17.
Of 90 samples the researchers could perform follow-up tests on, 84 showed some evidence of antibodies blocking SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2, a receptor the coronavirus uses to enter host cells.
Positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests suggest a prior COVID-19 infection, but they do not provide definitive proof, as prior exposure to other coronaviruses—some of which can cause a common cold—can produce a false-positive result. The authors conclude that it is unlikely that all 84 samples represent false positives, and therefore at least some reflect COVID-19 infections in December or early January.
Even though the authors tried to measure antibodies that were specific to SARS-CoV-2, cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses can’t be ruled out, George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not affiliated with the study, tells Live Science. He also notes that even if these results show actual COVID-19 infections, the researchers cannot determine where the participants acquired the infection—some blood donors could have recently traveled to China and became infected there, for example.
University of Washington epidemiologist Trevor Bedford, who has been using genetics to understand the timing and location of SARS-CoV-2 spread and was not involved in the study, writes in a Twitter thread that seasonal coronaviruses tend to circulate more often in the winter. He adds that antibody concentrations are typically higher in those recently infected compared to random healthy adults, suggesting that there could be a high false positive rate. Even if the results are accurate, then by extrapolation that would mean there were millions of infections in the general US population, which would have been accompanied by a higher excess death rate, he writes, something that wasn’t observed until March.
To better understand how often false positives occur, the researchers will look at blood samples from prior years to see whether they, as expected, would not show antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, Stramer tells the Times.
“We’re looking at the echoes of somebody’s infection,” Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security immunologist Gigi Gronvall, who was not affiliated with the study, tells USA Today. “I think we have pretty high expectations for the immediacy of our data and . . . the origin of diseases tends to be more murky and require months and years of investigation.”
Opinion: Emergency Use Authorizations Are a Threat to Science /-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TAIZHAN SAKIMBAYEV 
A
few weeks ago, the World Health Organization rejected the use of Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. This decision is in direct contrast to the US Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization (EUA) of the drug, and President Donald Trump’s glowing endorsement. It’s also a reflection of the steep price of EUAs—the price of undermining medical science.
The FDA can grant an EUA to a drug to treat COVID-19 to facilitate the distribution of new therapeutics when there are no alternatives. EUAs are an important tool during the early stages of any pandemic because they loosen restrictions on novel treatment options. The problem is that they end up interfering with clinical trials that would provide the best evidence on whether these drugs are safe and effective.
The EUA means it is “reasonable to believe” that the drug “may be effective.” This “may be effective” standard is a much lower level of evidence compared to the “effectiveness” standard the FDA uses for product approvals. In addition to remdesivir, the FDA has granted EUAs to three therapies: convalescent plasma, a monoclonal antibody drug called bamlanivimab, and, most recently, Regeneron’s cocktail of monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, the very ones taken by President Trump when he contracted SARS-CoV-2. The FDA previously granted and revoked EUA status for hydroxychloroquine.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for developing new drugs and vaccines. Patients are randomly assigned to either the control group receiving a placebo or to the treatment group receiving the experimental drug. RCTs are the foundation for the “first, do no harm” tenet of medical practice—for ensuring a drug’s safety and making informed decisions about whether the benefit of a new drug exceeds its dangers. But in a rush for COVID-19 treatments, we started throwing spaghetti on the wall, looking to see what sticks. And some, such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesvir, aren’t sticking, and things are getting messy.
Too many COVID-19 EUAs enhance the politicization of medical science and pollute the water for future research to get long-term answers.
In the case of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is often prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, its use to treat COVID-19 was highly publicized, politicized, and polarized. The FDA granted hydroxychloroquine EUA status on April 27, and less than two months later, on June 15, it was revoked after it became clear that at least one study supporting its use was based on questionable data and new scientific evidence showed that it had little to no effect in treating COVID-19 patients. Other research even indicated adverse events in patients who took it.
In all cases, even if a drug does turn out to be effective, granting a therapy EUA before it has completed clinical testing undermines the data and stunts the ability to properly collect and analyze that information to ultimately inform treatment decisions. When the FDA granted an EUA for remdesivir, our clinical trials on the drug came to a stop. Patients are less inclined to join a trial, in which they may or may not receive the drug, when they can just ask and receive the treatment that has been granted EUA status. And it’s unethical to ask a patient to participate in a clinical trial in which they may not receive treatment that has been approved by the FDA.
According to ClinicalTrials.gov, there are a few “active” clinical trials for current COVID-19 EUA therapies, and their progress and enrollment numbers are unknown. While EUAs are much needed, there should be more rigorous guidelines put in place to ensure that the clinical trials run their course before an EUA is granted. And, if an EUA is granted before that can happen, there needs to be a clearly defined plan to properly study the therapy post-authorization with new, updated protocols.
With respect to the COVID-19 therapies that have or will receive an EUA from the FDA, the good news is that authorization is temporary. The status can be revoked at any time, and such products have to be subjected to rigorous RCTs before receiving long-term FDA approval. What needs to be done now is to sort through the existing treatment options to determine which ones really work. President-elect Joe Biden’s administration should form an advisory panel to evaluate and reach some agreement on enabling and prioritizing studies of EUA treatments. This panel would establish priorities based on the limited data available on the COVID-19 drugs that have been granted EUA and new agents as they become available.
Sorting through this will be difficult because it creates ethical, financial, regulatory, and medical dilemmas. Patients need and require treatments and it is the doctors’ moral responsibility to “first, do no harm” and care for their patients with whatever treatments are at hand. Drugs cost money and clinical trials offer the potential treatments for free, while many insurance companies may not foot the bill for experimental EUA treatments. But if the use of multiple EUA drugs continues, without proper rigorously controlled clinical trials, we may never learn what is most effective and least harmful. Too many COVID-19 EUAs enhance the politicization of medical science and pollute the water for future research to get long-term answers. Going forward, we need approved therapies and national guidance on COVID-19 care and treatment.
Kevin J. Tracey is the president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, where Christina Brennan is the vice president of clinical research. At the start of the pandemic, Tracey and Brennan established a 200-person COVID-19 Clinical Trial Unit (CCTU) at the Feinstein Institutes to conduct controlled clinical trials to study the safety and efficacy of experimental COVID-19 therapies. Under their leadership, the research center has initiated seven clinical trials and programs and enrolled more than 1,200 participants.
Correction (December 6): This story has been updated to reflect that remdesivir is made by Gilead Sciences, not Regeneron. The Scientist regrets the error.
Infographic: A Cellular Defense Against Ebola Virus/-/O
verexpressing the transcription factor CIITA in cultured human cells turns on a gene called CD74, producing the protein p41, which binds to cathepsin proteases in the endosome (left). When the cells are exposed to an Ebola-mimicking virus, the p41-bound cathepsins are unable to cleave off the virus’s glycoprotein, stopping it from fusing with the membrane and thus trapping it inside the endosome. Later, the virus is likely brought to lysosomes and destroyed (not pictured). In a cell where CD74 is not overexpressed (right), cathepsins cleave the virus’s glycoproteins, enabling it to fuse with the side of the endosome and release its genetic material into the cytosol.

2020 Top 10 Innovations/-/ ABOVE: © THE SCIENTIST STAFF

e know the old saw: necessity is the mother of invention. Well, 2020 has shown us that a global pandemic is one serious mother. Typically, our Top 10 Innovations competition focuses on laboratory technologies, tools designed to plumb the mysteries of basic biology. But as biologists turned their sights to understanding SARS-CoV-2, the innovation landscape changed accordingly, with new tools developed and existing technologies bent to address the pandemic. So this year at The Scientist, our annual contest incorporates inventions aimed at understanding and ultimately solving the COVID-19 problem.
Among our independent judges’ picks for 2020’s Top 10 Innovations were core laboratory technologies—such as a single-cell proteome analyzer and a desktop gene synthesizer—alongside pandemic-focused products, including a rapid COVID-19 test, a tool that can capture antibody profiles from the blood plasma of convalescing coronavirus patients, and a platform for characterizing glycans in the spike protein that studs the surface of SARS-CoV-2. The competition among stellar submissions was so steep that this year’s Top 10 actually contains 12 products, thanks to a couple of ties.
As challenging as 2020 has been for all of us, this tumultuous year has given birth to promising products and approaches for elucidating the complex world of biology. And even more than that, 2020 has shown that the scientific community, when faced with a shared problem, can rise to the challenge and come together to refocus, research, and innovate. Here, The Scientist presents the tools and technologies that make up this year’s Top 10 Innovations. 
AbCellera Celium™
ABCELLERA
In late March, biotech firm AbCellera hosted a call with 40 researchers to review the data they’d collected on potential antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Using AbCellera’s high-throughput microfluidics and single-cell analysis tools to probe samples of COVID-19 patients, the company’s team had deciphered the genetic sequences encoding hundreds of antibodies that might treat the disease. Sifting through all of that data by hand was tedious, though, so the team fed it into Celium, a data visualization tool that intersects more than a million high-quality data points for those antibodies to reveal which ones might work best in patients as a potential therapy. In real time, on the call, the researchers used Celium to probe those relationships and home in on the LY-CoV555 antibody that, months later, entered clinical trials as a possible COVID-19 treatment, says Maia Smith, lead of data visualization at AbCellera and creator of Celium. “I think that kind of says it all.”
Before Celium came on the market in 2017, scientists working with AbCellera to find antibodies would get back complex spreadsheets of data that were difficult to navigate, and it was hard to know where to start, Smith says. Using Celium, data are presented in a visual format and the tool “helps you identify the right molecule for your needs,” Fernando Corrêa, a protein engineer at Kodiak Sciences in Palo Alto, California tells The Scientist. He’s partnered with AbCellera to identify antibodies to treat retinal diseases, and says the company’s package of microfluidics, single-cell analysis, and data visualization tool “streamlines the process of antibody discovery in a user-friendly manner.”
KAMDAR: "AbCellera’s response to the pandemic underscores the real power of the Celium platform at the intersection of biology and AI to make new antibody discoveries at a blazing speed."
Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 Test
ABBOTT
Since 2014, Abbott’s ID NOW system has helped physicians detect influenzas A and B, strep A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and most recently SARS-CoV-2, in less than 15 minutes. The toaster-size device works by heating nasal samples in an acidic solution that cracks open the envelope of the viruses, exposing their RNA, which ID NOW amplifies at a constant temperature instead of the heating and cooling cycles that PCR machines use. Gaining emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in late March, the COVID-19 ID NOW test was one of the first tests accessible to the US public.
Norman Moore, Abbott’s director of scientific affairs for infectious diseases, says the test’s short turnaround time is critical to stopping viral spread. “You’re the most infectious early on—and if we don’t have that result in that timely fashion, what does it help if a molecular test comes back two weeks later?” he tells The Scientist.
With more than 23,000 ID NOW devices in use in the US, mainly in urgent care clinics and pharmacies, Moore says his team is developing tests compatible with the platform for other infectious diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections.
J.D. Zipkin, chief medical officer of GoHealth Urgent Care, which partnered with San Francisco International Airport to administer the ID NOW COVID-19 test to travelers, calls the test a game changer. “[Abbott] took a platform that’s already really good at detecting very specific disease states and applied it to the biggest pandemic need that we have in this country,” he says.
The ID NOW platform costs $4,500 and each COVID-19 test costs $40.
CRUICKSHANK-QUINN: “The ability to receive COVID-19 test results from a throat or nasal swab in under 15 minutes can provide hospitals, schools, or any other institution with the ability to quickly test persons to determine those who would need to self-isolate at home. Since it is light-weight and portable it can be used in the field and at mobile sites like drive-thru testing locations."
BioLegend TotalSeq™-C Human Universal Cocktail v1.0
In 2017, researchers from the New York Genome Center published a new approach called CITE-seq that allows scientists to assess proteins in individual cells at the same time they are doing single-cell transcriptomics. CITE-seq works by linking antibodies with oligonucleotides that can eventually be sequenced to reveal whether target proteins were present and joined to their corresponding antibodies. Life science company BioLegend licensed CITE-seq and developed the TotalSeqTM-C Human Universal Cocktail v1.0, a collection of 130 oligo-linked antibodies for massive screening of the cell-surface proteins of individual cells, for use on a single-cell sequencing platform from 10X Genomics.
BIOLEGEND
In contrast to proteomics approaches based on visual assessment of tagged proteins, “there’s no theoretical limit anymore as to how many proteins you can [screen for],” says BioLegend’s Head of Proteogenomics Kristopher “Kit” Nazor, adding that the company is already working to expand the number of antibodies included in the cocktail. “That increases the opportunity for unbiased discovery massively.”
“It’s groundbreaking in many ways,” says immunologist and genomicist Alexandra-Chloé Villani of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University. Like many researchers, Villani, who is one of the coordinators of the immune cell segment of the Human Cell Atlas, pivoted this year to studying COVID-19. She has already used BioLegend’s cocktail, launched in early August at a price of $5,350 for five single-use vials, to analyze blood samples from nearly 300 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
“When you have surface protein and RNA in the same cell, it really helps us to derive a more granular definition of the immune cells involved” in response to infection, says Villani. “I actually know a lot of colleagues across the United States and Europe that have used this same panel to analyze their COVID cohorts . . . which means we’ll be able to combine all of our data and compare. And that’s incredible.”
MEAGHER: “This is a really nice merging of next-gen sequencing as a digital readout for sequence barcodes and single-cell barcoding technology to enable single-cell quantitative proteomics."
Seven Bridges GRAF™
SEVEN BRIDGES
The release of the human reference genome in 2013 was a tremendous leap forward for biology, but as far as actually representing humanity, it fell quite short. Our genomes are rife with variants not present in the reference genome, which was built from a small sampling of individuals, primarily of European descent. To account for human genetic diversity, bioinformatics firm Seven Bridges has developed a genomic analysis platform called GRAF that attempts to include all possible iterations of genetic sequences at any given locus. The resulting GRAF/Pan Genome Reference is a graph of the known variants at particular points in the genome, rather than a linear reference sequence. When genomes are aligned to the GRAF reference, any deletions, insertions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or other variations are therefore not missed as they might be when aligned to the linear reference genome.
With the goal of boosting the presence of underrepresented groups in genomic research, Seven Bridges announced in June that access to its GRAF Germline Variant Detection Workflow and GRAF/Pan Genome Reference would be free to academic researchers. “This is the first production-grade workflow that incorporates ancestry information and diversity of the human genome to provide improved variant calls and alignment,” says the company’s chief scientific officer, Brandi Davis-Dusenbery.
“The hope is that, by accounting for that complexity in the analysis, you will see things you were missing,” says Bruce Gelb, the director of the Mindich Child Health and Development Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. “That’s been an idea floating around for a few years, but nobody prior to what Seven Bridges is doing implemented a graph-based approach that is practical. They’re the first to do that.”
Gelb has been using the GRAF platform to search for variants related to congenital heart defects and comparing those variants to what turns up when he uses traditional sequence analyses. So far, he says, it appears that GRAF is identifying some variants that would otherwise have been overlooked.
CRUICKSHANK-QUINN: “The fact that Seven Bridges GRAF is being made freely available to academic institutions will certainly pave the way towards precision medicine by allowing research advancement in under-represented populations without the struggle of cost to academic researchers."
OXGENE TESSA
OXGENE
A central challenge to delivering gene therapies to patients’ cells is the cost of making adeno-associated virus (AAV), a common vector for genes of interest, says Ryan Cawood, CEO of UK-based biotech company OXGENE. “The first AAV gene therapy product that was approved in the EU cost a million pounds per dose,” he says. “If you wanted to treat a disease [with a therapy targeting a large organ] that you could apply to thousands of people, you just simply couldn’t make enough of it at a cost that would make it viable.”
Currently, Cawood says, batches of cultured human cells are transfected with multiple plasmids to induce them to make the AAV vectors containing a selected gene. But the plasmids are expensive to make, and the transfection process isn’t very efficient. By contrast, infection with adenoviruses naturally induces cells to activate replication of AAVs. The problem is, the adenoviruses also replicate themselves and contaminate the resulting AAV product. To get around this issue, OXGENE devised a genetic switch that shuts down an adenovirus’s activity halfway through its life cycle within a cell, so that it programs the cell to churn out AAV particles but not to make adenovirus. “When the virus goes in, you only get AAV coming out; you don’t get any more of the adenovirus coming back out,” Cawood says. The company began selling its research-grade viral vector, which it calls TESSA, in September, and plans to begin offering clinical-grade material next year, he adds. The cost for the research-grade vector starts at £5,000, and depends on the size of the batch of cells to be infected.

Codex DNA BioXp™ 3250 System
CODEX DNA
Biotech firm Codex DNA released the BioXp™ 3250 system in August 2020 as a follow-up to BioXp™ 3200, released in 2014. The automated platform for on-demand DNA assembly and amplification allows researchers to synthesize genes and genomes faster than ever, with the potential to accelerate the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, says Peter Duncan, director of product management at Codex DNA. The equipment can be used on cancer cells or a variety of infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2.
Without BioXp™ 3250 or its predecessor, labs that want to synthesize DNA fragments, clones, or whole genomes have to send samples out to be processed by a third party. In addition to having to deal with transit, such processing could take weeks or months. With the BioXp™ 3250, priced at $100,000, DNA sequences up to 7,000 base pairs in length can be assembled in a matter of days, with the push of a button.
Rather than having to code genetic script on a computer for specific experiments, customers can order a module that comes in about two days, ready to go. The module has a barcode containing all the necessary information; when scanned by the device, instructions for synthesizing the desired DNA are uploaded. A lab technician merely needs to insert the module into the device and press start, Duncan says.
“The BioXp has enabled us to perform simple subcloning steps hands-free,” Mark Tornetta, VP of Biologics Discovery at Tavotek Biotherapeutics, tells The Scientist in an email, describing how the lab uses the device to generate NGS libraries. “All of these methods [that are run] on the BioXP save us time and cost to perform.”
BLAINEY: "Democratizing gene synthesis by placing capability in individual labs for faster turnaround and lower costs at high throughput."
IsoPlexis Single-Cell Intracellular Proteome 
ISOPLEXIS
The Single-Cell Intracellular Proteome solution from IsoPlexis grew out of several labs at Caltech, all seeking better ways to monitor protein-protein interactions
in cancer cells with the goal of developing targeted treatments. With traditional methods such as Western blot, mass spectrometry, and flow cytometry, only a couple of protein types can be tracked at a given time. With Isoplexis’s system, launched in July, researchers can monitor 30 or more protein pathways, with results available on the same day.
With previous technology, phosphorylation was used to identify the function of the individual proteins, with no insight as to how they work together. The Single-Cell Intracellular Proteome reveals the function the same way, but is also able to provide the context of entire protein signaling pathways, uncovering how the network operates as a whole.
Understanding the entire network of cellular pathways allows researchers to better understand the downstream effects of aberrant cells, says Sean Mackay, CEO and cofounder of IsoPlexis. In cancers, he adds, this approach helps evaluate the efficacy of targeted treatments such as antibody therapies or small-molecule drugs.
“Such pathways basically define how cells are activated, [which] is particularly important for cancer, where activated phosphoprotein signaling is not only a hallmark of cancer,” says James Heath, who ran the Caltech lab that created the technology eight years ago, “but is a major focus of targeted inhibitors.”
MEAGHER: "The Single-Cell Intracellular Proteome solution uses innovative microfluidics to scale down what looks like well-established ELISA chemistry down to the level of single cells."
GigaGen Surge
GIGAGEN
Scientists have used intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to treat immunodeficient or immunosuppressed patients and convalescent plasma to treat infectious diseases for more than a century. And plasma is one of many treatments now being tried for COVID-19. But biological samples drawn from donors are not the most standardized therapeutics. Enter GigaGen’s Surge platform, which uses single-cell sequencing to “capture and recreate” libraries of antibodies from blood donors. To create these libraries, the company runs donors’ blood samples through the Surge platform to isolate individual antibody-producing B cells into microdroplets and extract the RNA that encodes the antibodies. From these genetic sequences they can create a “blueprint of that person’s immune system,” says GigaGen CEO David Johnson.
Company researchers then select some of those antibodies to engineer in mammalian cells to create a recombinant antibody treatment, which they say is much more potent than convalescent plasma or IVIG, based on in vitro experiments and tests in animal models. GigaGen does not currently plan to sell Surge, but rather has been using the platform to develop treatments for cancers, immunodeficiency disorders, and, most recently, COVID-19. GigaGen hopes to start clinical trials on their COVID-19 treatment, which uses more than 12,500 antibodies from 16 donors, in early 2021. The goal of Surge is to “tease apart the complexity of the immune system,” says Johnson, and then tailor antibody treatments that elicit the strongest response.
Fred and Vicki Modell, who founded the Jeffrey Modell Foundation after their son Jeffrey died at 15 due to complications from primary immunodeficiency, say they have been searching for an alternative to IVIG, which is sometimes in short supply and can lead to side effects in many patients. “[GigaGen] is giving the greatest gift of all—they’re giving hope to [immunodeficient] patients,” Fred Modell says.
CRUICKSHANK-QUINN: "By combining single-cell emulsion droplet microfluidics technology, genomics, and protein library engineering, this antibody drug therapy, if successful, could revolutionize COVID-19 treatment as well as treatments for many different diseases."
10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression
10X GENOMICS
A few years ago, 10X Genomics launched an assay, ATAC-seq, to identify regions of open chromatin in single cells; the product won a spot in The Scientist’s 2019 Top 10 Innovations. According to product marketing manager Laura DeMare, it wasn’t long before customers were clamoring for more, with feedback to the effect of, “‘This is great, but we’d really love to get the gene expression information and the ATAC-seq information in the same cell.’” In September, 10X rolled out Chromium Single Cell ATAC + Gene Expression, which harvests both epigenetic and gene expression data from individual nuclei.
The platform tags mRNA and open chromatin fragments from each nucleus with DNA barcodes, DeMare explains, and the nucleic acids are then amplified and analyzed. “You can begin to actually link which regulatory elements in the genome are turning on or off genes,” she says. It costs approximately $2,400 per reaction for the reagents and a microfluidic chip.
Ansu Satpathy, an immunologist at Stanford University School of Medicine and a former postdoc of ATAC-seq codeveloper Howard Chang, tells The Scientist that he’s using the new assay to investigate the effects of epigenetic changes associated with T cell exhaustion in tumor samples biopsied from cancer patients. When exhausted, T cells become less effective at battling cancer, and “what we’re doing now with the RNA and ATAC method combined is asking, How do each of those molecular switches regulate genes that lead to this dysfunctional outcome in the cell?” Satpathy says.
KAMDAR: "This approach allows, for the first time, the simultaneous profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome from the same single cell, enabling a better understanding of cell functionality."
10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution
Over the last several years, single-cell transcriptomics has provided a wealth of gene expression information for individual cells and cell types. Now, 10X Genomics advances the newer technology of spatial transcriptomics, which provides whole transcriptome data for just one or a few cells, and reveals exactly where in a tissue sample that gene expression is taking place. The Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution, launched in October 2019, exposes 55-micrometer areas at 5,000 locations within a tissue sample to mRNA-binding oligonucleotides, and overlays the resulting gene expression data with histological images.
10X GENOMICS
The technology was developed and originally marketed by Swedish company Spatial Transcriptomics, which 10X Genomics acquired in 2018. Then 10X developed the product further before launching Visium last year. The Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution, which sells for $1,000 per sample, has smaller and more densely packed spots—and five times more of them—than it did when the company inherited it, says Nikhil Rao, 10X Genomics’s director of strategic marketing for the spatial platform. This increases resolution, he explains. “We also improved the sensitivity of the assay dramatically, being able to pick up tens of thousands of unique molecular identifiers per spot.”
Rao says that many of Visium’s users focus on neuroscience, studying neurodegenerative diseases, for example. But the product is also being used in developmental biology, oncology, and immunology. Johns Hopkins University computational biologist Elana Fertig has used Visium to understand how a cancer can resist treatment. “By virtue of having the spatial information of these cells, you can really figure out the molecular mechanisms where they interact directly, because you can see if the cells are interacting physically,” she explains.
MEAGHER: "This is another frontier in biology: not just single-cell or few-cell gene expression, but now collecting gene expression data with spatial resolution at the level of a few cells."
Inscripta, Inc. Onyx™ Digital Genome Engineering Platform
INSCRIPTA, INC.
While CRISPR-based genome editing has become a widely used technique in labs all over the globe, there are research questions that require a scale of nucleotide tinkering that can be cumbersome, if not prohibitive, for some labs. Inscripta Inc.’s Onyx™ Digital Genome Engineering Platform offers a solution—fully automated genome-engineered libraries with hundreds of thousands of single edits in microbial genomes. The benchtop device, which launched in October 2019 and sells for $347,000, allows users to plant desired variants in the DNA of E. coli bacteria and S. cerevisiae yeast, and the instrument takes care of the rest. 
The platform combines everything from the algorithms for optimizing the editing process to the microfluidics for handling cells to the reagents themselves. “Biologists don’t have to worry about the technical optimization anymore and can go ahead and focus on any problem in biology now,” says Nandini Krishnamurthy, the vice president of applications development at Inscripta.
Shelley Copley, a molecular biologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, is an early tester of Onyx. She’s using it to examine the effects of synonymous mutations, those that don’t change the resulting protein, on fitness in E. coli. “The high-throughput part of it is critical to be able to address this,” she says. Rather than attempt to engineer each mutation she wants to examine one by one, Onyx enables Copley to generate all 50,000 variants. Her team can then move straight to the fitness assays. “I don’t know of any other technology that can do it.”
KAMDAR: "CRISPR is a powerful tool for editing genomes and allowing functional assessments that can elucidate causality and improve our understanding of genome biology. But those outcomes will not be achieved without overcoming a number of the technical and scalability challenges. This is what the Onyx Digital Genome Engineering Platform enables."
MOBILion SLIM
DANIEL JEFFREY STUDIOS
John McLean, a bioanalytical chemist at Vanderbilt University, wants to know exactly what’s in a puff of gas, down to a vaporized blood or tissue sample’s very last lipid molecule. For years, he has used mass spectrometry to catalog compounds in a sample by weight. Sometimes different molecules can have the same mass and the same atomic composition, making it hard to distinguish them. Ion mobility separation runs gas samples down meter-long tubes to differentiate molecules by shape and structure, getting around the mass issue. But because the technique was designed decades ago, it hasn’t achieved the same resolution as mass spectrometry. To achieve a similar resolution, the ion separation instrument would need a 13-meter tube.
Making a linear tube that length is impractical due to constraints on lab space. So a few years ago, Richard Smith of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and colleagues began brainstorming ways to get ions to turn corners. That discussion led to the development of MOBILion’s SLIM, or Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulation, an instrument with a 13-meter track cut as switchbacks in two circuit boards that fit in a 3-meter-long box; the device provides data on the size and shape of compounds in samples in minutes. SLIM “reveals the unseen,” says Laura Maxon, MOBILion’s head of business development and corporate strategy, “without the sacrifice of time.” This first iteration of SLIM, which MOBILion began deploying as a Beta version to early adopter collaborators the second quarter of 2020, is built for scientists in a pharmaceutical or clinical research academic environment. The price is competitive with existing technologies, she notes, and the company plans to design the instrument for use in the clinic to identify biomarkers of disease. 
“What we’re seeing today, from MOBILion on SLIM, is just the tip of the iceberg,” McLean says. “There’s a lot of untapped potential . . . from an analytical standpoint,” so “people should really expect huge advances for these technologies.”

THE JUDGES
Paul Blainey
Associate professor of biological engineering at MIT and a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.

itting down to write this editorial, I thought I would look back at the one I wrote for our first issue of 2020 to get a sense, at the end of an extremely unpredictable and disconcerting year, of how I was feeling going into it. “In those halcyon days of boyhood, one date stuck in my mind as ‘the future’—2020,” I wrote in The Scientist’s January/February 2020 issue. “That year, difficult to imagine but endlessly entertaining to dream about, was when everything would be different. World peace would be a reality. Technology would solve humanity’s and the planet’s ailments. And yes, cars would fly.”
I knew that my childish fantasies had failed to materialize well in advance of last January, but early in the year I had no idea how wrong I would be about 2020. This year has shown us all that, despite humanity’s decades of scientific, technological, and social progress, nature (human and otherwise) still harbors the power to bring us to our knees. We also learned that the time required to go from futuristic dream to dystopian nightmare is the veritable blink of an eye.

I, like the rest of us, have been trying my best to cope with the harsh new realities of the worst infectious disease pandemic in a century. One of the things that buoyed my spirit in the darkest hours was the sense that the life science community was rising to the challenge of COVID-19, with several labs pivoting to study the disease and the virus that causes it; drug companies and independent scientists speeding the development of tests, treatments, and vaccines; and researchers anticipating the need to study the societal and mental health effects of the pandemic. Other times, despondency took over, as news of publication misconduct surrounding COVID-19 broke and it became apparent that, in some countries, policy and science regarding the appropriate path toward coronavirus mitigation were seriously out of step.
Still, as I reflect on 2020, I see the heartbeat of research pulsing through the turmoil, even when science was sidelined, ignored, or contravened. Evidence of discovery in the face of numerous challenges can be seen in the pages of this issue, where we highlight the winners of our annual Top 10 Innovations competition (see page 38). Several of the winning submissions—including a rapid and portable SARS-CoV-2 test and antibody kits to help characterize the plasma of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, to name but a couple—address the pandemic head-on. Other winning products represent advanced development of tried-and-true laboratory technologies, such as microfluidics and single-cell analyses, that could potentially help battle the scourge of COVID-19.
And in mid-November, as I write this piece, news broke about the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being reportedly more than 90 percent effective in Phase 3 trials. These results are preliminary, but the scientific community and the world are responding with all the hope and positivity that one might expect.
It is my sincere hope that 2021 will be a better year than 2020. If this is to happen, research must continue to forge ahead, unimpeded by politicization and supported by the public, governments, and private parties alike. Never before has it been clearer that evidence, logic, and science are the keys to delivering us from the suffering of the past several months and the months to come.
We at The Scientist look forward to a new year and to following and reporting on the innovation and discovery that rise from the ashes of 2020. There will be much to keep tabs on, from continued vaccine development and testing to the long-term biological impacts of COVID-19. As case numbers rise around the world, and especially in the US, we know that there are more challenges and heartbreak ahead. But we will keep a close eye on the possible paths out of this pandemic, with science as our touchstone and navigator.

Blood MicroRNA Patterns Linked to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BUNDITINAY
F
ormerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome has long been neglected by physicians, researchers, and funding agencies, not least due to its mysterious causes. It’s often hard for patients to find doctors who can diagnose ME/CFS, a widespread condition characterized by debilitating post-exertion fatigue and other symptoms. 
A new study appears to make headway toward solving those difficulties. A recent analysis from more than 40 ME/CFS patients reports that a disease-specific stress test leaves a distinct signature of 11 microRNAs in their blood that change in abundance compared with blood drawn before the test. Most of these microRNAs are involved in regulating immunity, supporting the idea that immune dysfunction plays a key role in the disease’s pathology. The findings lay the groundwork for developing a molecular diagnostic test for the disease, the authors write in their study, which was published on November 12 in Scientific Reports.
Although the findings need to be replicated in larger cohorts, “I think there are many strengths here,” remarks Mady Hornig, an immunologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who wasn’t involved in the research. “There’s a lot here, in terms of the findings, that are really intriguing and important clues.”
MicroRNAs are short nucleotide snippets that act inside cells to regulate gene expression and have garnered much research interest over the past decade as potential diagnostic tools for several conditions in which they’re dysregulated. To Alain Moreau, who specializes in the molecular genetics of musculoskeletal diseases at the University of Montreal and the Sainte-Justine University Hospital, they were an attractive focus for exploring ME/CFS, in part because microRNAs also circulate in the blood, providing an easily accessible source of gene-regulatory information. 
Previous studies have flagged distinctive circulating or cellular microRNAs in ME/CFS patients, but some had very small sample sizes or didn’t compare patients with appropriate controls, making the data often hard to interpret, Moreau says. He and his colleagues wanted to overcome these issues, while also looking for microRNAs tied to specific symptoms in the condition, which he says he hoped would yield robust biomarkers. 
The hallmark symptom of ME/CFS is post-exertional malaise (PEM), a worsening of fatigue and other symptoms following physical or mental exercise that can leave patients bedridden for weeks. The researchers sought to probe microRNAs associated with this symptom, but to spare patients a full-blown bout of PEM in the clinic, Moreau’s team figured out that they could use a therapeutic massager—an inflatable arm cuff that exerts gentle pulsating compressions—to induce a milder form of PEM, as evidenced by headaches, muscle pain, and profound fatigue that patients reported in later questionnaires.
Starting with 11 severely affected, housebound ME/CFS patients, the team drew plasma samples before and 90 minutes after this challenge and screened for differences in levels of microRNAs. Computational analysis revealed 17 microRNAs whose levels had changed significantly after the test; their response also differed from that of eight age- and sex-matched healthy individuals who had been subjected to the massager but didn’t report any PEM symptoms.
Repeating this analysis in a larger cohort of 32 ME/CFS patients and 17 matched controls, the team discovered the same response patterns for 11 microRNAs. In fact, a machine learning algorithm the researchers trained could correctly diagnose someone with ME/CFS based solely on the change in concentration of these microRNAs after the massage intervention. “We were unable to misdiagnose a [healthy] control as ME/CFS, or inversely, ME/CFS as a control,” Moreau says.
The need for diagnostics and drugs for ME/CFS
There’s an overwhelming need for definitive diagnostic tests for ME/CFS, says Frances Williams, a genomic epidemiologist at King’s College London who wasn’t involved in the research. Diagnosis is currently made by excluding other conditions, which is difficult, time-consuming, and a frustration for patients. The fact that Moreau’s team could replicate their results in a larger cohort is encouraging, but she says she doubts that microRNAs will form a standalone test for ME/CFS, simply because of the genetic and epigenetic complexity of the disease. However, microRNAs “could be helpful in combination with other things,” she says.
Hornig says the test has many strengths in terms of translating it for use in a clinical setting. For one, its focus on free-floating sequences in the blood makes it technologically simpler than a technique used in a previous study that requires extracting microRNAs from inside blood cells. She also praises the team’s PEM-inducing stressor, which reflects the sensitivity of severely affected ME/CFS patients to their sensory environment, but is less taxing than physical exertion “and respectful of the patients’ experience and fears,” she says.
We were unable to misdiagnose a [healthy] control as ME/CFS, or inversely, ME/CFS as a control.
—Alain Moreau, University of Montreal and Sainte-Justine University Hospital
Moreau encourages other institutions to replicate the results. The findings will require validation in larger cohorts to ensure the test can diagnose patients with all subtypes of ME/CFS, different stages of the disease, and those from a variety of regions and ethnicities. Hornig adds it’s also important to investigate differences with the results of other studies—for instance, previous work on cellular microRNAs in ME/CFS suggested disparities in how men and women responded to exercise, whereas Moreau’s results found no sex-based differences. She’s also curious about where the microRNAs come from, suspecting immune cells or muscle tissue as possible origins. “This opens a lot of questions.” 
Using a different algorithm, Moreau’s team found that they could cluster the patients into four discrete groups based on the precise pattern of their microRNA responses to the PEM challenge. Interestingly, these groups happened to also share clinical features—one group, for instance, had markedly severe symptoms. To Moreau, this indicates that different mechanisms operate in different subsets of the disease, which could help explain why drug trials for ME/CFS patients have so far been largely inconclusive. But he says he hopes to use microRNA data soon to match patients with drugs they’re more likely to respond to. His team suspects, for instance, that the immunomodulating drug rintatolimod, which activates Toll-like receptor 3, might not be effective in patients with high levels of microRNAs that impede the transcription of that receptor. “I [hope] the test will open the door to more . . . precision medicine in the field of ME/CFS,” Moreau says.
To Williams, the major value of the study lies in an analysis Moreau’s team conducted with the microRNA data that untangles the molecular pathways the 11 sequences are involved in.
This revealed that 7 out of the 11 microRNAs were involved in regulating immune functions, which “certainly fits with one arm of the research that suggests that immune activation is very important in leading to chronic fatigue,” she says.
An additional network analysis flagged the key genes each microRNA is associated with and other diseases they’ve been linked to, which included viral infection, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairments. “Using a network approach, you can start to shed light on which cellular processes are important. And then if that ties in with what we know already about the cellular processes in ME/CFS, then that all begins to paint a bit of a picture.”
The findings are relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing numbers of “long-hauler” patients left with enduring fatigue symptoms, a phenomenon that has many experts concerned that the coronavirus could trigger ME/CFS in a subset of infected people. The pandemic “will bring a huge number of new [ME/CFS] patients, and some of them are relatively young. That will create some devastating impacts for themselves and their families,” Moreau says. “That’s why we need to hurry and hope that we will convince governments and funding agencies to [put more funding into the field].”

The Promise of mRNA Vaccines/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SERHEII YAKOVLIEV
E
arlier this month, the world finally received some good news about COVID-19. Interim results from Phase 3 clinical trials revealed that two vaccine candidates—one from the Pfizer and BioNTech and another from Moderna—were more than 90 percent effective. In addition to sharing what appears to be very high efficacy, the vaccines have something else in common: they are both made with messenger RNA (mRNA).
mRNA vaccines work by providing the genetic code for our cells to produce viral proteins. Once the proteins, which don’t cause disease, are produced, the body launches an immune response against the virus, enabling the person to develop immunity. mRNA can theoretically be used to produce any protein, with the upside that it much simpler to manufacture than the proteins themselves or the inactivated and attenuated versions of viruses typically used in vaccines, making it an appealing technique, says Norbert Pardi, an mRNA vaccine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.
The concept of using mRNA to produce useful proteins to fight disease has been around for decades. But until now, no vaccines using this technology have made it this far in clinical trials. The success of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines “is really good for the RNA field, because until very recently, there were just a handful of people who really believed in mRNA vaccines,” Pardi tells The Scientist. “We now have the chance to really prove [their usefulness] in an actual outbreak situation.”
Overcoming obstacles to mRNA vaccines
In an early proof-of-concept of using gene-based therapeutics to produce the proteins needed to fight disease, published in 1990, scientists reported that in mice, cells successfully produced proteins encoded in injected RNA or DNA. The method was potentially revolutionary: It could, in theory, be used to engineer any protein the body needed to boost immunity against pathogens and fight diseases such as cancer and rare genetic conditions.
I would predict, and others have too, that this will beckon a new era for the application of mRNA towards infectious diseases, particularly as rapid response platforms to help deal with outbreaks.
—Nick Jackson, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)
Despite its promise, there are challenges associated with working with mRNA. Ordinary mRNA produces only low levels of proteins, and the molecule degrades too quickly inside the body to make it suitable as a therapeutic. On top of that, RNA can trigger an immune response that’s independent of the response to the protein it encodes. “If you just inject foreign RNA into people or animals, you can induce a very serious inflammatory response,” Pardi says. He adds that this is our bodies’ defense mechanism against viruses, which can use either DNA or RNA to store their genetic information.
Because of these problems, the uptake of this technology was slow, and many scientists chose to instead focus on developing vaccines with DNA, which is more stable and easier to work with, says Margaret Liu, the chairman of the board of the International Society for Vaccines and a pioneer of gene-based vaccines. (Liu is on scientific advisory board of the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, which developed AstraZeneca’s vaccine for COVID-19.)
A few key technological advances have contributed to the success of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. In the early 2000s, mRNA vaccines got a boost when a pair of scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, discovered that by altering the building blocks of RNA—nucleosides—they could address some of key limitations of the technique. In a seminal 2005 paper, they reported that modified, synthetic nucleosides could both increase protein production from the mRNA and drastically suppress the immune system’s reaction to the mRNA molecules themselves. (Karikó is now a senior vice president at BioNTech.)
“I think pretty much everyone acknowledges this as the big breakthrough [for mRNA vaccines],” says Liu.
Scientists still needed a method to fortify the mRNA against rapid degradation after injection, however. Pardi, along with Karikó and Weissman, helped identify a solution: by encasing mRNA in small bubbles of fat known as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), they were able to protect the molecule and enhance its delivery into cells.
“The really difficult challenge for the field for the last at least four to five years has been the delivery [of the mRNA],” says Nick Jackson, the head of programs and technology at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organization providing funding for many SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including Moderna’s. “It’s really been thanks to the incredible innovation around LNPs that has finally shown the validation of this platform and opens the floodgates to mRNA potential.”
“Exciting times for RNA vaccines”
Scientists have clinically tested mRNA vaccines for a wide range of infectious diseases, including rabies, influenza, and Zika. Until now, none have made it past small, early-phase clinical trials. The two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are “by far the most advanced,” Liu tells The Scientist. “None [of the others] were as promising as what we’ve seen.”
In fact, the SARS-COV-2 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna far exceeded expectations. The reported efficacy of more than 90 percent for both surpasses the US Food and Drug Administration’s 50 percent efficacy cutoff for considering a vaccine for emergency use authorization (EUA).
The results for Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine “are really quite good, I mean extraordinary,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told The Washington Post earlier this month. (NIAID collaborated with Moderna on the other SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.)
Why these vaccines seem so effective while previous attempts against other pathogens haven’t appeared as promising remains an open question. One simple reason, according to Liu, might be the sheer volume of resources that were poured into developing them. Liu also hypothesizes that one explanation for the high levels of efficacy is that the vaccines might be triggering a nonspecific inflammatory response to the mRNA that could be heightening its specific immune response, given that the modified nucleoside technique reduced inflammation but hasn’t eliminated it completely. On the flip side, she adds, this may also explain the intense reactions such as aches and fevers reported in some recipients of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. (Others have suggested that the lipid nanoparticle is responsible for these severe, but transient, side effects reported in some trial participants.)
Ultimately, it’s too early to say why these vaccines so far appear to work so well. “These do remain interim results. They do remain unpublished. And we still need to see the extensive safety databases associated with these products,” Jackson says. There are also issues to sort out, such as concerns about needing to store the vaccines in freezers—especially in the case of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs to be kept at –70 °C. (Another mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, developed by the German company CureVac, can be stored at 5 °C. That vaccine, which is based on non-modified mRNA, is in a Phase I clinical trial.)
Still, the early success of the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 have scientists optimistic about the future of this technology. “These are really exciting times for RNA vaccines,” Pardi tells The Scientist. In addition to applications in infectious diseases, researchers in both academia and industry have been pursuing the use of mRNA vaccines to harness the immune system to fight cancer. One of the biggest benefits of the mRNA platform is its flexibility, Pardi says—for example, he is currently investigating ways to encode multiple viral proteins into a single vaccine, which could help produce a more potent immune response against a virus.
Now that mRNA vaccines have revealed their potential, many more vaccine makers will likely develop an interest in the technique, according to Jackson. “I would predict, and others have too, that this will beckon a new era for the application of mRNA towards infectious diseases, particularly as rapid response platforms to help deal with outbreaks.”
SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Variant May Be More Transmissible/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
FREEZELIGHT
B
efore March, most of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that researchers worldwide isolated and sequenced encoded an aspartic acid (D) at residue 614 of the viral spike protein. By April, the majority of viral sequences harbored a single mutation in the genome converting the D to a glycine (G). Presently, the 614D variant has been all but replaced by the 614G variant globally.
These findings, described in a study published in Cell in August, and corroborating evidence from other groups have led scientists around the world to investigate whether the rapid shift in representation of circulating viral strains is based on random introduction by a group of mobile founders or if it indicates that 614G provides some sort of selective advantage to the virus—making it more infective, for instance. 
An answer to this question would have big importance to addressing the pandemic, according to Jessica Plante, a virologist at the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch, because “a random event is unlikely to have massive epidemiological consequences.” On the other hand, she says, “if the virus is truly more infectious, or if the virus is causing more severe disease, that’s something that we need to be able to verify very quickly, so that the public health side can realize that a more contagious or a more severe form of the virus is now spreading.”
Several studies published this fall point to the latter, that 614G transmits more readily than 614D.
In a paper published in Cell November 18, researchers evaluated more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the United Kingdom between January and June. As in other places, 614G became the dominant variant in late March in the UK, after multiple independent introductions, mostly from people who had traveled internationally. The authors also confirmed that 614G is not associated with infection severity and observed that younger patients were more likely to have 614G and have higher viral loads. Their results support the idea that 614G is under positive selection and likely affects virus transmissibility.
“Even with that massive data set, we were almost pushing the limit of the ability to identify that this effect was there,” coauthor Thomas Connor, a genetic epidemiologist at Cardiff University in Wales, tells The Scientist. Detecting such a subtle change in infectivity would be much more difficult with a smaller sample size.
What they suggest is that the patterns that we see are consistent with a selective advantage, and that this gene mutation arose and has now dominated because it is likely an adaptation [to] humans.
—Nathan Grubaugh, Yale School of Public Health
“A lot of groups—including [in] this study, which is by far the largest sample number in any of the studies published to date—were looking at the increase in this particular variant over time. But what makes this new study really exciting is that they had done it all within a small population, so all within the UK,” rather than amassing samples from around the world, which increases the possibility of additional confounders, says Judd Hultquist, an infectious disease researcher at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, who did not participate in the work.
“Their ability to sample this particular population with great depth allowed them to track multiple independent introductions of the same viral variant into the population,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. “Seeing the same trend emerge after multiple independent introductions allowed them to make conclusions about how these different viral variants spread.”
“What they suggest is that the patterns that we see are consistent with a selective advantage, and that this gene mutation arose and has now dominated because it is likely an adaptation [to] humans,” says Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health who did not participate in the work. “We’ve seen in the past where you have something from an animal population that spills over into humans, it’s going to slightly adapt to be better in the system.”
That apparent heightened contagiousness of 614G could be due to the production of more virus during infection. Hultquist’s group published a paper November 11 showing that patients infected with the 614G variant had higher viral loads in their upper airways than did patients with 614D.
The findings hold up in animal models, too. Plante and her colleagues showed in a study in October that hamsters infected with the 614G variant had higher viral loads in the upper respiratory tract, but not in the lungs, than did animals with 614D. They hypothesize that these higher viral loads could lead to increased transmission.
“It’s speculated that the more virus you have, the more contagious you might be to somebody else,” says Grubaugh. “And in principle that makes sense, but in reality that’s also a hard thing to prove or disprove.”
The next question is to determine in a transmission model whether the 614G variant really is more infectious, Hultquist says. “Multiple independent groups have now collected data that is consistent with the 614G variant of the virus being more transmissible, but it still hasn’t been proven that the virus is more transmissible.”
Martin Beer, a virologist at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany, and colleagues released a preprint on October 27 that includes a head-to-head comparison of 614G and 614D in ferret and hamster models of viral transmission. “In this competition experiment, with a 50/50 mixture, the 614G out-competed the 614D in most cases,” he says.
Taking all these various lines of evidence from the lab and epidemiological observations of the pandemic together, “there is an indication now . . . that this is most likely not a founder effect. This is probably a real advantage for the virus,” Beer says. But to which extent the 614G variant is more easily transmitted under real-world conditions is a difficult task, he adds. “614G is for sure not less efficient than the 614D. There is a good chance that it is more efficient—for example, in a ‘super spreader’ event.”
Because multiple groups have shown that neither form has “an impact, at least that we know of, on disease severity, knowing what virus you’re infected with won’t impact your treatment regimen or whether or not you will be protected from a vaccine, or whether the drugs will work,” says Grubaugh. 
“The things that [people] can do to protect themselves from one variant or another variant are all the same,” agrees Hultquist. “Wear a mask. Be cognizant of your social distancing. Wash your hands regularly, and follow local public health guidelines.”
COVID-19 Research Biased Toward Only a Handful of Genes/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, THEASIS
S
cientists have identified more than 2,000 human genes linked to COVID-19, yet the bulk of the published literature is dominated by only a small subset of them, a fact that may be limiting progress in the fight against the pandemic.
A team at Northwestern University, led by data scientist Thomas Stoeger, had previously shown that scientists tend to focus on a handful of genes—specifically, less than 20 percent of all genes in the human genome accounted for more than 90 percent of the publications they analyzed. Prior to the Human Genome Project, scientists had an incomplete view of the full suite of human genes and relied more heavily on those that had analogs in model organisms or were easier to study using knockout experiments. The advent of modern sequencing technology—including complementary tools such as CRISPR, mass spectrometry, and RNA-based approaches—has broadened what researchers know, but it seems that scientists are still holding to old patterns.

HELIO TEJEDOR NAVARRO
In a study published today (November 24) in eLife, Stoeger and his Northwestern colleague Luís Amaral looked to COVID-19 research to see if scientists were similarly prioritizing certain genes during the pandemic in case reports and research on mechanisms of infection and transmission, diagnostic tools, and treatments. The pair analyzed 10,395 published papers and preprints and compared the genes studied in those publications against a list of genes linked to the virus through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 
As the pandemic has progressed, they found, scientists have become focused on a small subset of genes to the exclusion of others that may also be important. Of the roughly 2,000 genes identified by the GWAS reports, only 611 were included in the literature they scanned. In particular, three genes, which code [KG1] for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor the virus uses to enter cells; C-reactive protein, an inflammation marker; and interleukin 6, a signaling molecule involved in inflammatory responses, accounted for 25 percent of the total research. When they compared these COVID-19 papers against a set of roughly 466,000 non–COVID-19 papers from before 2016, Stoeger and Nunes discovered that whether or not the research related to the pandemic, the same types of genes—those advantageous to experimentation—still command the most attention. 
The Scientist spoke with Stoeger about how researchers choose which genes to study, what information they could be missing, and ways that research can open up to previously overlooked genes. 
See “Scientists Play Favorites with Studying Human Genes. Here’s Why.”
The Scientist: In the paper, you mention this historical bias around the genes that scientists choose to focus on, and you talk about how these choices predate the Human Genome Project. Can you describe how people were selecting genes to study prior to the Human Genome Project?
Thomas Stoeger: Science is difficult, and so scientists start with the least difficult research problems. The research questions scientists worked on before the Human Genome Project tended to be on genes which are interesting and very useful to study, but also happened to be easier to study in a few different ways. 
One way is that the human genes [they chose] also had related genes in model organisms, such as fruit flies or worms, and the related gene had already been studied. The shortest genes have also been studied much more than others . . . because they’re easier to work with. And there are also some other chemical properties, for instance, the proteins encoded by the genes. When proteins sit on the outside of the cell, for example, it’s easier to access them. All of these things together made experimentation less difficult. 
TS:  How does this new paper build upon the previous work that you have done looking at this bias in gene choice for research?
Stoeger: It’s our wish to capture all aspects of biology and make them interlinked so that we can compare social questions to questions of chemistry [and] biology. Conceptually, this paper is a little bit different from the last one. The last one was mostly on things that were in the past. Now, we want to know—for something very current where many scientists are all working on the same thing—to what extent [do] we stick to the same past bias or to what extent do we do something new? So maybe the better answer would be for me to say that we want to know if emerging global threats are subjected to the same biases that affect the rest of the medical literature.
See “Two Genetic Regions Linked with Severe COVID-19”
TS: Can you tell me a little bit more about LitCovid, the program that you used to identify the genes being studied in COVID-19 research?
Stoeger: I’m a data scientist who tries to integrate many different resources. I’m always particularly thankful when other institutions have already cleaned the data and brought it into a very nice shape. 
LitCovid is a curated list of publications that relate to COVID-19 [managed by the National Institutes of Health], and they’ve already computationally tagged individual concepts within those articles. You can imagine it as having all of the abstracts and titles and results, and whenever there is a word linked to a gene there is something inserted into the text that says, “Here is a gene,” and each gene has a unique number. Computationally what they’re doing is using a type of natural language processing to make a model of how language works and making tags that relate to genes or diseases. 
Sharing this data very openly allows people like myself to combine it with other data, such as data from the past or data from different experiments, to see how all of these different things relate together.
TS: What kinds of information might we be missing out on by focusing only on this small subset of genes?
Stoeger: The honest answer is that we really don’t know. We don’t know what all of these other genes that pop up in large experiments related to COVID-19 do. Many of the top studied genes in the COVID-19 literature are very important genes and should be studied, but they’re not the full story.
TS: How do scientists break out of this rut and bring some of these unexplored genes into scientists’ work?
Stoeger: This is something we try to answer in some upcoming work by looking historically at cases when people managed to make some genes more popular, [although] we realize that it is very rare that people succeed. 
But there are a few strategies that might work better than others. One strategy is to basically . . . take these experiments that survey our genes and actually focus on the new ones. Another thing to encourage work in this sector [would be] initiatives that solicit individual research grants. Right now, these only include a couple of genes, but there’s maybe 10,000 or more genes that would be worthwhile to study. And then there’s one strategy that I personally follow, which is taking some really important biological context that has already been studied a lot, such as aging, and taking all of the evidence that’s out there and focusing on these genes that have been overlooked but have some mounting evidence that they’re important.
TS: You said that if you look in history, there are examples of genes becoming more popular. Do you have an example of that that comes to mind?
Stoeger: There is a gene called C9orf72 that is now one of the most popular genes of the last 10 years. A group [carried out] genome-wide association studies for the association between some neurological diseases and different mutations in the human genome. They found that mutations in this gene were associated with [dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. People didn’t expect this gene to be linked to these diseases, but all of a sudden people showed that this gene alone was actually better at explaining which patients would suffer from the diseases than any other gene that had already been studied.

Q&A: Science Has Been “Resilient” During Pandemic, Survey Finds/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
YORKFOTO
S
cientists, like everyone else, have had to adapt creatively to the pandemic this year—whether by making labs out of their laundry rooms or quickly pivoting their research to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes. In late October, journal publisher Frontiers reported results from a survey that asked those researchers how the pandemic has affected their lives. Based on data collected in May and June from 25,307 participants worldwide, the findings offer insight into scientists’ working conditions in the time of COVID-19, their attitudes to how scientific findings should be shared, and their biggest concerns for the future.
The Scientist spoke to Frontiers’s marketing and communications director Chantelle Rijs, who led the study along with executive editor Frederick Fenter, to learn more about the survey and its findings.
TS: Why did Frontiers want to do this survey of researchers?
Chantelle Rijs: We are all very passionate about science and we are very passionate about the role that science plays in society. . . . It’s the science that’s going to help us get out of this crisis. So it was imperative for us to give our community, the scientists, a voice during this incredibly challenging time, especially when they are under such extraordinary pressure to provide answers.
Twenty percent of researchers reported that their worlds had completely changed and that they are now no longer able to do their work.
TS: Can you tell me about who took part in your survey?
CR: The participants are all members of the Frontiers community. Our community is made up of active researchers who have either published their research with us or sit on one of our editorial boards as an editor or a reviewer. A hundred and fifty-two countries are represented in the study, but it represents our network, not necessarily the wider scientific community.
We have around six hundred thousand authors and one hundred thousand editors and reviewers. The majority of them come from the US and Europe, so we were not surprised to see the highest number of responses coming from those particular regions. . . . In total, we had over twenty-five thousand academics who participated. From what we can tell, this is one of the largest academic surveys that has been conducted. I think this is indicative of the fact that the scientists themselves want to be heard, and we were very happy to be able to provide them that platform.
TS: What did you learn about how researchers’ day-to-day lives have been affected this year?
CR: So, twenty percent of researchers reported that their worlds had completely changed and that they are now no longer able to do their work. South American countries appeared to be the hardest hit by this—almost a third of respondents in Argentina, Chile, Brazil all said they were no longer able to perform their job function.
However, despite this massive disruption to our lives, the majority of the research community has been resolute. We’ve had seventy percent of researchers saying they’re able to continue with their research, even if from home, and ten percent saying that they’ve been completely unaffected by the pandemic.
Writing papers for publication was the most common task—also unsurprising, considering they’re now out of the lab and in their home offices. It’s something that we felt at Frontiers as well—we saw a sudden increase in manuscript submissions over this time.
But I think more importantly, it really was very encouraging for us, and it gave us a sense of hope that the research community is able to remain resilient during times like this, especially with new waves of COVID sweeping across the world right now.
The percentage of respondents (in a sampling of countries) who responded that they were “no longer able to perform my work, or my role has changed completely” in answer to the question, “How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the way you work?”
DATA SOURCE: FRONTIERS 
TS: That increase in papers you mentioned—was it on a particular topic?
CR: It was on coronavirus. We had around six thousand submissions on COVID papers alone.
TS: There’s been a lot of debate about open science. What did your survey reveal about scientists’ attitudes towards data sharing and open science, and how those attitudes might have changed this year?
CR: I think that the pandemic has encouraged many to reconsider how they share their work, with researchers saying that they are now more likely to publish open access, they are more likely to share their data, and they are more likely to start using something like a preprint server as a result of COVID-19. We saw that PhD students and medical professionals were the two groups who were the biggest supporters of open science and data sharing.
There is concern about the covidization of research funding—that it all gets funneled into COVID research at the neglect and at the expense of other key areas.
But we also saw other publishers make all of their coronavirus research open and accessible as soon as the pandemic hit. So our question is: What about their oncology research, or their research into dementia or Alzheimer’s? It’s very obvious to us that all research needs to be open access, not just coronavirus research. It will be interesting to see whether these paywalls are reinstated in time, or whether they’ll decide to unlock research in other areas.
See “Journals Open Access to Coronavirus Research”
TS: A few parts of the survey asked researchers to think about what’s going to happen later in the pandemic and after the pandemic. What were some of the biggest concerns that scientists had for the future?
CR: The results showed that researchers are pragmatically considering how to prepare for and mitigate future crises. Their biggest concern is the threat of a future pandemic—again, unsurprising given that the questions were asked right in the midst of the first wave. They warned about the danger of new viruses, vector-borne diseases, bacterial diseases arising from antibiotic resistance. Here, they stressed the importance of learning from our current situation to prepare for any future threats that might arise.
The second-biggest concern was climate change. And here they drew parallels between the immediate actions taken to mitigate COVID-19 and the kind of action needed to tackle environmental threats.
There’s concern that funding is being redirected away from their areas of research. One of my colleagues commented that scientists are always going to say they’re worried about funding . . . . But yes, there is concern about the covidization of research funding—that it all gets funneled into COVID research at the neglect and at the expense of other key areas.
Percentages of respondents who mentioned particular subjects in response to the question, “What future threats could be prevented if we prepare for them properly?” Frontiers analyzed text responses using an algorithm that identified keywords and themes; each person’s response could be categorized in more than one theme. 
DATA SOURCE: FRONTIERS 
TS: These data were collected in May and June. Are there things you expect to have changed since then, and are you collecting more data?
CR: We’re definitely considering doing another one next year. Just this week alone, there are lots of reports coming out . . . around vaccine development. The efficacy of those vaccines will dictate to a certain extent how we’re all living and working, and the concerns that we have, in the future. It will be very interesting to see where we are in six to twelve months’ time, and if we still have those same concerns.
I’m not sure we’ll do such a big survey again. We had around twenty questions and we also asked them information about their field of study, location, et cetera. . . . Maybe a smaller subset of that, focusing on key areas, rather than a big extensive survey like the one we just conducted. It would allow us to get the results out quicker as well—to collate twenty-five thousand survey results is very time intensive.

Q&A: COVID-19 Infectiousness Peaks Early in Sickness, Study Shows/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
JORDANSIMEONOV
S
ince early March, a number of studies have suggested that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 generally have a long incubation period and are most infectious early on in their sickness, with viral loads dropping off after nine days. These results have informed guidelines put forth by public health bodies, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommend that people isolate for at least 10 days following a positive COVID-19 test.
A meta-analysis published November 19 in The Lancet Microbe reviewed 98 studies on coronaviruses—79 of which focused on SARS-CoV-2 and the rest on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV—to determine when patients’ viral loads are highest and could therefore transmit the virus most effectively. Of the SARS-CoV-2 studies, 73 included hospitalized patients only.
Their report finds that patients with COVID-19 show the highest amount of live virus in the upper respiratory tract within the first five days of showing symptoms, while the highest amount of virus in SARS and MERS is seen during the second week after showing symptoms. Despite finding high viral RNA loads, no study in the review isolated live virus beyond day nine after the first symptoms of COVID-19.
The Scientist spoke with Muge Cevik, a virologist and a clinician at the University of St Andrews and the lead author of the analysis, about the findings.
The Scientist: What inspired you to do this research?
Muge Cevik, University of St Andrews
MUGE CEVIK
Muge Cevik: Around April, we were writing a review paper mainly for clinicians. In writing that paper, we realized that we don’t have a good understanding about viral load dynamics and infectiousness periods not only for [SARS-CoV-2] but also for [SARS-CoV] and MERS. With my colleague from Glasgow University, we set up this systematic review and recruited four doctors to work together because systematic reviews are quite a huge task. At the beginning of the pandemic—I’m a clinician as well—we were not sure when to stop isolating patients, when we can safely discharge patients, and when patients stop being infectious. These have important implications for cases in the community but also cases in the hospital setting. 
TS: How did you go about deciding which studies you were going to include in your analysis? 
MC: In our analysis, we included papers mainly looking at viral load dynamics. We wanted to include large studies—that’s the reason we excluded case reports or case series with less than five patients because generally [they] report atypical, unusual cases, and that’s typically those who basically shed virus for a long time.
We didn’t want our subjective opinion to influence the results, so specifically we included studies that counted the viral shedding from the time of symptom onset, not from time of hospitalization, and some studies actually included patients after discharge from hospital, so we didn’t know when the symptoms started. We tried to make it really similar across all studies, and that’s the reason our inclusion criteria were really strict.
TS: The scientific community has had inklings in terms of COVID-19’s infectious window, so did the results surprise you at all?
MC: This study really emphasizes that people are highly infectious really early on, especially seeing peak viral loads around symptom onset to day five. I’m not that surprised, but I think it doesn’t align with our ‘test, trace, isolate’ practice because in order to prevent onward transmission, testing, on itself, is not enough. We need to ensure those people who are infectious isolate and their contacts isolate. In a way, that emphasizes that we need much more prompt testing and prompt results so we can prevent onward transmission. What happens at the moment is that people seek testing around two or three days after symptom onset, and by the time they get test results, they’re already past the most infectious time period. Many people struggle to take sick leave without having the test results, so that tells us that we need to change the way we look at ‘test, trace, and isolate’ now—maybe symptom onset needs to prompt isolation before testing. 
There’s been a lot of emphasis on testing, but testing on its own is not an intervention. It needs to be connected to an intervention, especially when it’s a respiratory pathogen.
The other aspect is that the majority of studies agree that the infectious virus is not detectable after day nine, and when we put that result with the peak viral load, which happens around day five, it basically tells us that people are really infectious in the first week of symptom onset. At the moment, when patients come into the hospital, they’re already around day six or eight after symptom onset because people have pneumonia around day eight after symptom onset, so that tells us that, when people come to hospital with a possible diagnosis of COVID-19, they may not be as infectious as . . . a case in the community. 
TS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases have also made it difficult to test, trace, and isolate—what did you find among the asymptomatic cases you included in your analysis?
MC: There were very few studies looking into this, but what we found is that the majority of studies agreed that initial viral loads were similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic people. When I say asymptomatic, these were studies only recruiting those with no symptoms whatsoever throughout the disease course, not those presymptomatic patients, because we know that if you have peak viral load around symptom onset, that means people can be infectious before symptoms begin. What we found overall is that you know asymptomatic individuals have shorter viral shedding, which means they may be infectious but for a shorter period, and maybe that’s a reason that, in contact tracing studies, asymptomatic patients seem to be one-third as infectious as someone with symptoms. Another study we’ve done looks at transmission dynamics in asymptomatic people, and what we found is it generally happens among households. People have much more opportunity to transmit to each other—it may happen [over a] very short period of time, but they have [a greater] opportunity to transmit it to [each other]. 
TS: How does your analysis of SARS-CoV and MERS put the viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in perspective?
MC: It shows why SARS-CoV was a bit easier to control in the community because the viral load peak actually occurred in the second week after symptom onset. . . . It was probably the time when patients were already hospitalized, which is a bit different than COVID-19, where we’re seeing really high viral loads really early on, so people are really infectious in the community. Another major difference in SARS-CoV and MERS is that we saw a lot of hospital-based outbreaks—almost sixty percent of all outbreaks were based in the hospital. We’re not seeing that much for SARS-CoV-2. These results put these three highly infectious pathogens into context and [explain] why we’re seeing different patterns and why we’re struggling to contain SARS-CoV-2 because it spreads really quickly in the community. 
TS: Which of the ‘test, trace, and isolate’ protocol do you think we need to focus on more, based on your research?
Our results emphasize why it’s been very difficult over the last few months and how we move forward—maybe it could be shortening the isolation period but giving more support to people to isolate during that five-day period when everyone is so infectious.
MC: I think the isolation part is the weakest part of our programs. It’s not surprising that we’re having difficulty containing the virus because when we look at—and I don’t know the numbers in the US—but in the UK only one in five people isolate. That means even if we do more testing, if people don’t or are not able to isolate—this may be [due to] their working or living conditions—we won’t be able to prevent onward transmission. 
There’s been a lot of emphasis on testing but testing on its own is not an intervention. It needs to be connected to an intervention, especially when it’s a respiratory pathogen. If I’m someone that my family is dependent on and if I need to pay my rent, if I’m not getting sick leave from my employer—people need to make difficult choices. I’m especially worried about people on zero-hour contract jobs where there’s no linkage to support. When we look at the global figures, countries who supported their citizens—I’ve seen a couple of papers from Vermont and New York—have much better isolation numbers. That emphasizes that we need to do more to support more disadvantaged groups, especially working people, because even when we were in lockdown, we’ve seen that there there’s been a difference between those areas where [people are] still commuting to work versus people who are able to work from home. 
We know that there are certain groups in the population that are at high risk of acquiring, being exposed to, and transmitting [the virus] to their household because of living conditions. And we know that crowded housing increases the risk of transmission, so I think we need to do more to support immediate isolation. Supported isolation needs to be a norm. In any public health intervention, if you support people, they will do what’s needed. 
Our results emphasize why it’s been very difficult over the last few months and how we move forward—maybe it could be shortening the isolation period but giving more support to people to isolate during that five-day period when everyone is so infectious. There’s a need to balance risks and benefits but also listen to people—what are their needs and how we can support them. 
TS: How might your study help our readers decide what they should and shouldn’t be doing, particularly as the holiday season approaches?
MC: First of all, if you have symptoms, even mild symptoms—COVID-19 does not only present with cough and fever, but people have other symptoms like severe muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, [loss of taste and smell]. These are all early symptoms that tell us it could be COVID-19, so if you have those symptoms, isolation needs to start promptly. Especially within the first five days of symptoms, we need to be very, very careful not to interact with high risk and vulnerable contacts—especially elderly people or those with comorbidities. 
But again, we can be infectious before having symptoms so that tells us that we need to be careful and behave as if we have the infection and could transmit it to someone else.

Assay for Sickle Cell Anemia Is Repurposed to Diagnose COVID-19/-/ABOVE: Feluda-based detection of SARS-CoV-2
DR. DEBOJYOTI CHAKRABORTY’S LAB, CSIR-IGIB
I
n 1965, the famous Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray created a beloved fictional detective named Feluda. In a series of short stories, the astute gumshoe tracks a vandal trying to destroy the ancient temples of India, busts a counterfeit medicine racket in Kathmandu, and cleans Bombay smugglers’ clocks. Inspired by the great analytical skills of the detective, researchers at the Delhi-based Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology have given their new CRISPR-based diagnostic for COVID-19 the affectionate nickname of Feluda (short for FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay). TataMD Check, the commercial name of the test powered by Feluda, was launched on November 9 in India.
The test uses the CRISPR-Cas system to probe for genetic sequences specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples from nasal swabs or saliva applied to a paper strip. Like the fictional Feluda, it is fast, accurate, and works in all manner of field settings, according to a preprint posted to medRxiv in September. The regulatory agencies in India conducted an independent evaluation of the assay on patient samples and found Feluda to be highly accurate in detecting COVID-19 infections.
“The combination of precision, speed, and affordability in this technology is remarkable,” says Prashant Yadav, a healthcare supply-chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, DC, a think tank largely supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
The Drugs Controller General of India approved Feluda for commercial use on September 19, and in an October 22 advisory, the Indian Council of Medical Research approved its use by public and private laboratories. The test costs about 500 rupees ($6.75 US) to make and process in the lab for a patient sample and gives results within an hour.
“Once validated at large scale and commercial manufacturing issues are dealt with, it can become the mainstay of COVID-19 testing, not only in India but many other countries in the world who are seeking a fast, affordable, and precise test,” says Yadav, who is not involved in the project.
India’s first reported case of COVID-19 was on January 30, and the first death on March 12.In the beginning of the pandemic, testing was limited to a few publicly funded laboratories in India. Later on, it was extended to private labs. Still, capacity is limited. India currently tests only around 0.1 percent of its population of 1.4 billion each day, causing the country to rank among the lowest in the world on a per-capita basis.
The US has nearly as many tests per day—around 1.2 million, compared with India’s 1.5 million—but a population that is smaller by a factor of four, explains Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University and at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in India who was not involved in the research. “I would think that we should test about 0.5 percent of our population every day, as an ideal, but we are testing more than ever before,” he says.
Earlier this year, a team of researchers at the Pune-based biotech company MyLab Discovery Solutions developed a test kit—PathoDetect—for COVID-19 that returns results in 2.5 hours with 100 percent accuracy. It was the first real-time PCR test for the novel coronavirus made in India that was approved in the country. It costs about $16. For PathoDetect, a significant limiting factor is the cost of the real-time PCR machine itself, which can be around $26,000 US.
Feluda, however, uses a paper strip to reveal results, similar to the readout of a pregnancy test. Anyone who can run a normal PCR machine and follow a simple pipetting protocol can do this, says co-lead scientist Debojyoti Chakraborty. Feluda can be performed at any diagnostic lab or healthcare center that houses a simple PCR machine and its equipment and reagents are less expensive than PathoDetect’s are.
The assay has been tested on more than 2,000 samples. It detected those who have SARS-CoV-2, a measure of sensitivity, 96 percent of the time, while ruling out those who didn’t have the virus, a measure of its specificity, 98 percent of the time.
From sickle cell anemia to COVID-19
Feluda emerged out of “serendipity,” says Chakraborty. For the past two-and-a-half years, he and his colleague Souvik Maiti had been working on a Cas9 system that could detect the mutation in the gene that causes sickle cell anemia for point-of-care CRISPR diagnostics. To test their approach, they traveled to far-flung healthcare centers in Chattisgarh state in India and collected saliva samples from people known to have sickle cell anemia as well as from potential silent carriers of the mutation.
As they were readying the publication of their results in January, COVID-19 hit, and they wondered if they could repurpose the technology to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Starting right away, Chakraborty says, his team of graduate students and postdocs worked day and night, with some colleagues falling sick with the virus along the way. By March, they had developed a prototype diagnostic, and in May, they licensed the technology to TATA Medical and Diagnostics Limited, which ushered it through regulatory approval.
Feluda works by first converting viral RNA from a sample to DNA, and then amplifying specific viral genes via PCR, during which it puts a biotin tag on the amplified products. Following this, the sample is incubated in the same PCR tube with a fluorescently tagged FnCas9–guide RNA complex, which looks for these sequences from SARS-CoV-2 and hooks onto them, creating a larger complex of the fluorescent FnCas9 and biotin-labeled viral DNA sequence. Then, the technician adds a buffer and dips a paper strip into the tube. Gold nanoparticles on the paper recognize the fluorescent tag and the whole complex flows up the strip and gets deposited on a line of streptavidin, which interacts with the biotin label on the DNA. The accumulation of the nanoparticles produces the visible signal.
There are a handful of other CRISPR-based tests for COVID-19, including one developed by MIT and Harvard University, and these employ Cas12 or Cas13 proteins to find the virus.
Harikrishnan Jayamohan, a research scientist at the University of Utah who was not involved in the work, says, “If Feluda works on a large scale in India, this would be a good alternative to RT-PCR. This would also be a big jump over antigen tests, which are widely-used, cheap, fast, and easy to use but are of very low sensitivity.” Nearly 50 percent of India’s COVID-19 diagnostics are done through antigen testing.
“Feluda is good in certain ways,” says Rakesh Kumar Mishra, the director of Hyderabad-based CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology who was not involved in the Feluda research. It will be particularly useful in remote places because Feluda can work with a simple PCR machine and that machine can be housed in rural healthcare center. But the real value of a paper-strip test is when it can be used for self-testing or at home, Yadav says, although Feluda is not ready for that yet.
“This is a tough thing we’re fighting,” says Mishra. “Any tool is a good tool.”

Breastmilk Harbors Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FLY VIEW PRODUCTIONS
M
ilk from lactating moms may hold potent antibodies to counter SARS-CoV-2 infections, according to a new study of 15 women. All of the samples from women who had recovered from COVID-19 and who were breastfeeding babies at the time had antibodies reactive to the virus’s spike protein, researchers report in the November issue of iScience. 
Detecting antibodies against the virus in breastmilk indicates that mothers could be passing viral immunity to their babies. Women can “feel pretty comfortable breastfeeding” during the pandemic, Christina Chambers, a perinatal epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego, who not involved in the new study, tells The Scientist.
To date, there’s no evidence that a mother can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to her baby through breastmilk, Chambers says. She and others have tested breastmilk for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and found a few positive results, but no live virus. Her latest research also suggests that donor milk is safe for babies’ consumption, too, though she hasn’t assessed antibodies in donor milk banks she works with yet.
I think the potential is really great, if we get past this taboo that it’s breastmilk.
—Rebecca Powell, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Antibodies in breastmilk may be useful for more than protecting nursing infants from the virus. Antibodies extracted from milk—as opposed to the current practice of using convalescent serum—could also serve as a therapeutic for COVID-19. However, “people question that this is something that could really happen,” says study coauthor Rebecca Powell, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Because there isn’t a wider understanding of the immune benefits of breastmilk, she says, the concept has not caught on in antiviral drug development.
Detecting breastmilk antibodies
Powell has been investigating human milk immunology for the past four years and was analyzing how the seasonal flu vaccine prompted an immune response in breastmilk when the coronavirus pandemic spread to New York City earlier this year. Switching to study the SARS-CoV-2 immune response in breastmilk was “a no brainer,” she says. “There’s so many unanswered questions in general about milk immunology, but to be able to study it with a novel pathogen was really important.” 
By early April, she and her colleagues had received approval to begin collecting milk samples from lactating mothers who had recovered from COVID-19. The researchers collected samples from eight women who had a SARS-CoV-2–positive PCR test and seven who had suspected cases of the disease but were not tested; all 15 were lactating at the time. The team then compared the samples to ones from different lactating mothers amassed before the pandemic began, first assessing them for the presence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then checking the ability of any antibodies found to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
All the of samples from the women who had recovered from COVID-19 had specific SARS-CoV-2 binding activity, while the pre-pandemic samples had low levels of nonspecific or cross-reactive activity, the researchers report. They next tested the antibodies’ response to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and found that 12 out of 15 of the samples from previously-infected donors showed significant IgA binding activity. Some of those samples also included other reactive antibodies such as immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M. Compared with the controls, it was IgA and IgG levels that were the highest. 
The results align with a study published in September in the Journal of Perinatology that also detected high levels of IgA and some IgG and IgM that were reactive to the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a majority of milk samples collected during the pandemic. None of the breastmilk tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a PCR test, suggesting none of the mothers were infected at the time of sample collection. 
There was also no documentation of whether the 41 women who donated samples had ever been infected with the virus, notes study coauthor Veronique Demers-Mathieu, an immunologist at Medolac Laboratories in Boulder City, Nevada, so it’s unclear if these antibodies were the result of SARS-CoV-2 or another viral infection.
The team did collect general health information on the donors of the milk samples and found that S1 and S2 SARS-CoV-2–reactive IgG levels were higher in milk from women who had had symptoms of a viral respiratory infection during the last year than in milk from women who hadn’t had any symptoms of infection. IgG abundance was also higher in the samples from 2020 than from those taken in 2018, long before the pandemic started. The IgA and IgM antibody reactivity, however, didn’t appear to be specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 and did not differ between the 2020 samples and the 2018 samples, meaning these responses could be the result of cross-reactivity from antibodies generated after exposure to other viruses. That suggests the antibodies secreted in breastmilk provide a broad immunity to breastfeeding infants, Demers-Mathieu says.
Benefits of breastmilk versus blood antibodies
One important feature of these antibodies, whether specific to the virus or not, is that they are secretory antibodies, Powell notes. The B cells that secrete antibodies into milk originate from the mucosal immune system in the mother’s small intestine. Those B cells travel through the blood to the mammary glands and secrete IgA that’s then shuttled from the mammary tissue to the milk via a transporter protein. Those proteins, called secretory components, leave pieces of themselves on the antibodies, wrapping around them and protecting them from being degraded in the infant mouth and gut. “Secretory antibody is found not only in milk, but in saliva and all other mucosal secretions,” Powell explains. “It’s not unique to milk, but it is not what you find in the blood.”
That difference could give breastmilk-derived antibodies an advantage over blood-based ones as far as therapeutic options go, she explains. Antibodies such as IgG that are extracted from serum and transfused into the blood of a sick person travel throughout the body and might not go where they are needed. But secretory antibodies, such as IgA from breastmilk, could be extracted and then inhaled into the respiratory tract—just where those antibodies are needed in COVID-19. Because of the protective secretory component they have, these antibodies can endure in the mucosa and target the virus, Powell explains.
“What we are finding in the milk is unique compared to what many people have already studied in the blood in terms of antibody response,” she says. Research suggests that blood-derived antibodies can last months. Secretory antibodies in breastmilk might last longer, Powell’s most recent data indicate, and that means there could be a longer window to collect antibodies from lactating donors after they’ve recovered from COVID-19.
Neither Demers-Mathieu’s nor Powell’s studies tested whether the breastmilk antibodies could neutralize SARS-CoV-2, which is a next step in both teams’ research. Powell has early results suggesting the breastmilk antibodies do neutralize the virus, and a company called Lactiga has partnered with her to continue developing the idea of extracting antibodies from breastmilk to counter COVID-19. 
“I think the potential is really great,” says Powell, “if we get past this taboo that it’s breastmilk.”

oderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate is 94.5 percent effective at protecting people from infection, compared to patients who received a placebo saline shot, according to an interim analysis of 95 participants the company released today (November 16).
“These are obviously very exciting results,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells CNN, noting he expects the first vaccinations to begin toward the end of December. “It’s just as good as it gets—94.5 percent is truly outstanding.”
The results put Moderna’s vaccine on par with competitor Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, which was found to be 90 percent effective in a preliminary analysis of 94 participants. Both companies are expected to seek authorization for emergency use in the US and from other global regulators in the coming weeks. The European Medicines Agency announced today that it has begun a rolling review of the Moderna vaccine.
Both vaccines use mRNA to instruct cells to create many copies of a piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing the immune system to be prepared to attack the virus should it try to invade. Although there are other vaccines in development that use this technology, none have been approved yet.
As mRNA can quickly degrade in warm temperatures, vaccine storage presents a serious practical challenge. While Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored at –70 °C, Moderna’s can be kept at –20 °C. Moderna also said today that once thawed, its vaccine can remain stable for a month at 2–8 °C. 
“The fact that two different vaccines made by two different companies with two different kinds of structures, in a new messenger RNA concept, both worked so effectively confirms the concept once and for all that this is a viable strategy not only for COVID but for future infectious disease threats,” Barry Bloom, a public health professor at Harvard University, tells The New York Times.
It’s unclear exactly how many of the trial’s 30,000 participants, who received either two doses of the vaccine or the placebo, have contracted COVID-19. The interim analysis includes 95 confirmed cases—five who had been given the vaccine and 90 who received the placebo. Among this group, 11—all in the placebo group—developed severe COVID-19. 
“It was one of the greatest moments in my life and my career. It is absolutely amazing to be able to develop this vaccine and see the ability to prevent symptomatic disease with such high efficacy,” Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, tells CNN.
Like the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s reportedly does not have any serious side effects, but a small percentage of participants in the study experienced symptoms such as body aches and headaches. Pfizer did not release data on the vaccine’s performance to prevent severe cases.
Both companies announced their findings in press releases, not in peer-reviewed journals, and neither company provided the detailed data that would allow outside experts to evaluate their claims. As the studies continue, the figures on the vaccines’ efficacy may change. It is also unclear how long the immunity provided by the vaccines will last. Moderna and Pfizer conducted their trials using slightly different protocols. While participants in the Moderna trial needed to display at least two symptoms of disease in addition to a positive test for the virus to be officially counted as a COVID-19 case, the Pfizer trial required only one symptom and a positive test. Pfizer started counting cases seven days after the second injection of the vaccine, and Moderna waited 14 days.
Moderna has a $1.525 billion contract to provide the US with 100 million doses of the vaccine through Operation Warp Speed, with an option to purchase an additional 400 million doses.
The MSC: Regeneration Orchestrator/-/The mysteries of a salamander regenerating its tail or a sea cucumber mending its organs have fascinated humans and perplexed scientists for centuries. The idea that the human body holds similar mechanisms to heal and repair itself is tantalizing and not altogether impossible. There are powerful cells called mesenchymal stem cells situated on the 50,000–100,000 miles of blood vessels in the human body. These cells carry the ability to initiate signaling cascades that drive tissue repair and regeneration.  
In the mid-1960s, Marshall Urist, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of California Center for Health in Los Angeles, depleted all of the mineral calcium phosphate from pieces of bone. Urist took the remaining demineralized bone components and placed them into the muscle of an adult mouse and made the surprising discovery that bone could subsequently form in muscle tissue.1 
In the late 1960s, Arnold Caplan, now professor of biology and director of the Skeletal Research Center at Case Western Reserve University, was perfecting a cell culture medium cocktail that converted cells he isolated from the presumptive wings and legs of chicken embryos into cartilage, bone, or muscle. His goal was to find the molecular signals that differentiated these cells into specialized tissue lineages. 
When Caplan learned of Ursit’s results, he was intrigued. “I realized that there were stem cells—cells that could respond to powerful inductive molecules that must exist in the adult tissue,” said Caplan. “And so, coming from an orthopedic background, I knew that there were magic cells, magic elixirs, in bone marrow.”
Bone marrow has been associated with orthopedic healing since the days of Aristotle, and several studies in the mid-1960s suggested the existence of bone-related progenitor cells. Together with one of his post-doctoral researchers, Stephen Haynesworth, Caplan began purifying cells from human bone marrow in a search for cell types that make bone, relying on the same medium cocktail he perfected for embryonic chicken cells.2  
“That magic medium was the whole trick to the entire mesenchymal stem cell technology,” said Caplan. “In that medium, the cells from bone marrow, which are very rare—one in 100,000, one in a million—stuck to the Petri dish and divided like wildfire.” 
Medicinal Signaling Cells 
Caplan and his team found that they could manipulate the adhered bone marrow cells to differentiate into muscle, cartilage, bone, or fat on tissue culture dishes. This ability to readily form a variety of cell types from the middle or mesenchymal layer of the body suggested a new type of adult stem cell, leading Caplan to coin the term “mesenchymal stem cell (MSC).” 
Colorized scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
“It turns out that that was a mistake,” said Caplan. Scientists at the time believed that cells behaved the same in tissue culture as they did within the body. “MSCs inside your body never differentiate the cartilage, never differentiate the bone, never differentiate the fat. So, in your body, these cells are not stem cells,” said Caplan. Instead, they are much more. 
In the body, MSCs play an important role in maintaining stem or progenitor cell niches and homeostasis. They arise from perivascular cells called pericytes that reside on the surface of every blood vessel and act as a filter between blood vessels and tissues. If a blood vessel in any tissue becomes damaged, pericytes fall off the vessels and differentiate into MSCs that then orchestrate the formation of new vessels and tissues by recruiting and activating adult stem cells or progenitor cells that are already present in the tissue.3,4 
“If you break a bone, there is a cell in your bone that is already there to make new bone. What the MSC does is pause that cell, give it a molecule to make it divide, and get it to make the new bone. The MSC doesn't make the new bone. The MSC is the instructor, the manager of the regeneration of every tissue,” said Caplan. 
MSCs also act as surveillance cells that control the immune system and secrete influential bioactive molecules. They sense changes in the local environment, and in response, they secrete large quantities of immunomodulatory agents to mitigate the body’s immune reaction as they secrete bioactive and extracellular matrix-building molecules to repair or regenerate damaged tissue. In their surveillance, MSCs also detect pain signals from the nerve and secrete molecules that bind to opioid receptors. Within minutes, the sense of pain dissipates.3,4  
MSCs serve as powerful internal pharmaceutical factories that direct the body’s natural biological mechanisms to alleviate pain and activate tissue regeneration. As scientists have more precisely defined the roles MSCs play in the body, Caplan has argued for a name change. “Instead of calling them ‘mesenchymal stem cells,’ I've renamed them ‘medicinal signaling cells,’" said Caplan.
Of Life and Resurrection
Caplan recognized the potential of these cells to treat a plethora of diseases and began to reach out to investors for help in funding MSC-based cell therapies. Every day, scientists in academic laboratories make profound discoveries. However, many of these discoveries never result in new medicines or treatments because many basic research scientists lack the network and capital needed to translate basic research into therapeutic products. Additionally, many biopharmaceutical companies see early-stage basic research as a risky investment.5,6 In fact, in 2017, venture-capitalist backed companies produced more approved drugs than traditional large-scale pharmaceutical companies.6  
Initially, Caplan was turned down by several investors. Then he met Kevin Kimberlin, chairman of Spencer Trask & Co., an advanced technology development firm with a legacy of helping engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs develop scientific findings into market-leading companies. Kimberlin was familiar with the potential for cellular therapy, having previously patented and developed the technical basis for the first approved cell-based immunotherapy with Jonas Salk of The Salk Institute of Biological Sciences. “We sensed that the MSCs might become a keystone in this new field of medicine, so we committed to find a way to commercialize Caplan’s discovery," said Kimberlin.
In their first meeting, Caplan showed Kimberlin that he could isolate MSCs from bone marrow, expand their numbers in culture, and then infuse them to dock at specific sites of injury. Within the body, the infused MSCs seemed to repair the bone and cartilage at the same time and in the appropriate locations.
“I was impressed when he explained how our natural MSC population declines steadily as we get older, but that he could isolate and multiply their number to possibly give us the regenerative ability of youth,” said Kimberlin. “I said, ‘You have discovered the ability to heal people; I don’t know how we are going to build a company around this, but we have to try.’” Together the two launched a biotech venture called Osiris Therapeutics Inc., which they named after the Egyptian god of life and regeneration. 
Osiris Therapeutics became the driving force behind several early MSC-based discoveries, expanding both scientific knowledge of these cells and development of real-world therapies. A broad portfolio of cellular-matrix products emerged for treating skin ulcers, burns, severe wounds, and the first approved implantable cell-matrix product. Most astonishingly, the Osiris researchers realized that the MSC could be fashioned into a drug delivery vehicle, serving as a drugstore for sites of injury.  
Scientist working in a lab
In one influential early study, scientists at Osiris Therapeutics and their collaborators used MSCs to treat 12 children with steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Children with this disease suffer a violent immune reaction to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, where the body attacks itself, causing the intestinal lining to peel away. For the estimated 20% of children who are resistant to pharmaceutical steroid treatment, GvHD disease is fatal. In the Osiris trial, seven of the twelve children who received MSC transfusions showed complete remission from the disease at one month, and 95% of the children lived at least six months, a dramatic improvement from the typical 25% survival rate for children on traditional immunosuppressive treatments.8 In this study and in other early MCS cell therapy studies, researchers observed no adverse reactions,3 and this approach became the world’s first systemically delivered cell-therapy.7 
Clinicians are now conducting trials to explore the utility of MSCs for treating COVID-19.9 One preliminary study conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City reported success with eleven out of thirteen critically ill COVID-19 patients. The MSC treatment decreased inflammation, increased the number of virus-fighting T-cells, and repaired or regenerated lung tissue.10
“Translating the MSC from an amazing insight into the first allogeneic cellular drug is a story that reminds us of why the work of basic scientists is so crucial and why developing fundamental science into practice is just as important,” commented Kimberlin.
Today, there are approximately 1,195 clinical trials in progress exploring the use of MSCs to treat more than 900 conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarct, stroke, Crohn's disease, chronic heart failure, low back pain, and more. “The difference between traditional pharmaceuticals and cell-based therapy is that a pharmaceutical is a single drug, very highly purified, that has a very precise function. Conversely, an MSC goes to sites of damage, looks around, analyzes everything that's going on and then makes drugs,” said Caplan.
“We are at the beginning of what I hope will be hundreds of uses for MSCs to heal conditions which cannot be treated any other way,” said Kimberlin. “That is something we can all look forward to.”
“There's the joy of knowing that I had the right instinct to start a company because that's the only way this technology would get the resources to move forward. We are looking at the horizon and saying, ‘How can we make the horizon better and brighter?’” said Caplan. 
Kimberlin commends Caplan for uncovering this new knowledge, sharing it, and encouraging others to add to and critique it. His tireless work to translate these insights into products saved hundreds of children’s lives. 
“To me, this type of scientific innovation is the highest manifestation of moral good and Dr. Caplan exemplifies this noble purpose,” concluded Kimberlin. 
At the age of 78, Caplan still ventures into his laboratory every day, often spending 60-80 hours each week researching new ideas and discoveries. “I'm an academic, and in a philosophical sense, my role in society is to continue to add new information. And that's how society progressed from the stone age to the current age. We keep adding knowledge, and we keep turning the knowledge into wisdom. I still do it because I can see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Caplan. “For a basic scientist to actually see his work provide medical therapy is an enormous gift.”

Q&A: Minks Can Transmit SARS-CoV-2 to Humans, Study Shows/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
GEORGY_GOLOVIN
M
illions of minks globally have contracted COVID-19, leading government officials to call for the animals’ culling to prevent the virus from mutating, potentially reinfecting humans, or thwarting vaccination efforts.
Last week the World Health Organization launched an investigation into virus transmission on mink farms because researchers had identified one mutation labeled D614G in the spike protein of the virus that may increase transmission. There is no evidence so far that the mutation would increase virulence. It also “does not appear, at this point, that that mutation that’s been identified in the minks is going to have an impact on vaccines and affect a vaccine-induced response,” noted Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a November 12 webinar hosted by the think tank Chatham House.
Humans did initially inadvertently introduce the virus into mink farms, according to an analysis of the viral genomes of minks and of workers from 16 farms in the Netherlands. There was evidence of human-mink transmission and also transmission from the mink back to humans, researchers reported November 10 in Science.
The Scientist spoke with study coauthor Wim van der Poel, a zoonotic virology expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, about his findings.
The Scientist: Tell me the story of how you first started this research project.
Wim van der Poel
MIRIAN HENDRIKS
Wim van der Poel: The actual research in the mink was started right after we detected the virus in the mink farm. What happened is that there was a respiratory disease seen in the mink farm. These farms in the Netherlands have regular visits of specialized veterinarians, and one of these veterinarians tested the animals for the “normal” respiratory disease pathogens. 
But that was all negative, and then he remembered that the susceptibility of minks was discussed with the [Dutch] Ministry [of Health, Welfare and Sport] by specialists, [including van der Poel]. We already feared that minks could be susceptible because we knew from animal experiments that ferrets were susceptible, and ferrets and minks are very much related.
See “Ferret Study Reinforces Role of Aerosols in SARS-CoV-2 Spread”
So then we tested the animals by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and they appeared to be positive. We had a meeting with experts in the field right away, and we set up this consortium for further research in the first outbreak farms. That’s the basis of the paper that we published in Science.
TS: In your paper, you use whole genome sequencing to better understand where this virus came from, and how it’s being transmitted. What did this experimental tool tell you about what’s going on in these minks? 
WVDP: What we did is we started sequencing all the mink [samples], but also we tried to obtain samples from all the people working in the farms because it was clear that these people were exposed and also we wanted to know where and how the virus was introduced. It was traced back to people being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and these people are likely those who have introduced the virus [to the farms]. 
We could see that the sequences of the mink and the people working in the farms are related. From the first 16 farms, you can see five different clusters of sequences, and the clusters of sequences are single introductions by people. [In other words, each farm has a unique subcluster of the virus.] 
We also compared [the mink farm viral sequences] to the sequences of the [virus in the] general population in the Netherlands, and what we saw is that in the general populations, the sequences are not [closely related to] the mink sequences—only the people working in the farms [carried related viruses]. In the Netherlands, it seems that there is very little transmission from the farms to the general population apart from the people working in farms.
There are sequences that occur far more often in mink than in humans, but in the data that we have, it seems that all the single mutations that we see in minks have also occurred in people. But we don’t see any mutations that we think are really mink-specific and more dangerous to people. Of course, that needs further investigation because in Denmark, for example, they found a combination of mutations in the spike protein, and that change will result in a change in that protein that they feared would make the virus more aggressive. 
TS: The past few months, scientists have been debating whether animals can transmit the virus back to humans. How does your report add evidence to this debate?
WVDP: The pandemic is really driven by the circulation in people, but the paper also clearly proves that there is transmission back from the minks to the people. That’s important here—we have to be aware of the fact that by spreading the virus . . . to other species, you may have a wider epidemic and you may also have the risk of a continuing reservoir in animals. If we eradicate the virus from people, by controlling it or by vaccination, you would have the risk that you have a remaining reservoir in the mink, for example. That was also the reason for the Dutch authorities to start culling the mink, because at that time, in June and July, the number of infections in the Netherlands was decreasing. 
TS: There have been COVID-19 outbreaks in minks all over the world—in Denmark, the Netherlands, and the US. How should the results of your study inform how public health officials handle SARS-CoV-2 in animals in which the virus can easily spread?
WVDP: I think that’s very important that researchers and public health authorities realize that spreading the virus to other populations of animals may have the risk that you create reservoirs. Also, from the mink, the virus may spread to other susceptible wildlife. There are other Mustelidae species like badgers, martens, and otters—these are related to mink, so if the virus spreads from mink to that kind of wildlife, you may end up with a reservoir in these species.
That’s something we’re also looking into now. We are testing that kind of wildlife to see whether this occurs. It’s important to look into because if there is a maintained reservoir in wildlife, you may always have the risk of the virus coming back to people.

SARS-CoV-2 Exits Cells Via Lysosomes/-/ABOVE: A pseudocolored electron micrograph shows SARS-CoV-2 (pink) inside the lysosomes (outlined in green) of an African green monkey kidney cell.

cientists know a lot about how SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, gets into cells. Now, in a study published October 27 in Cell, researchers have determined that mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV-2, both of which are members of the β-coronavirus family, get out of cells via lysosomes, organelles responsible for taking out cellular garbage, rather than using the biosynthetic secretory pathway used by most other enveloped viruses.
“There hasn't been a whole lot of cell biology done on coronavirus assembly and release from cells, which is important . . . because we have no antivirals that target these later steps of the virus infection cycle,” says Carolyn Machamer, a cell biologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. This work not only points to new potential targets for inhibiting the later steps of infection, but also provides new understanding of the basic biology of these viruses, she adds.
About five years ago, Teegan Dellibovi-Ragheb, then a postdoc in cell biologist Nihal Altan-Bonnet’s lab at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, started to investigate how β-coronaviruses—the family that includes the pathogens that cause MERS and SARS—get out of cells. She found that the β-coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which causes severe pneumonia in mice, doesn’t use the same secretory pathway that most viruses that have an outer lipid and protein envelope—including γ-coronaviruses, which infect birds—use. After Dellibovi-Ragheb moved on to another job, though, Altan-Bonnet says that no one else in the lab wanted to take up the project to determine how these viruses were getting out of infected cells.
“Not many people were interested in coronaviruses,” she says. “And then the pandemic hit.” 
Altan-Bonnet and Sourish Ghosh, a current postdoc in the lab, got to work, infecting different cell types with either MHV or SARS-CoV-2. The researchers found large numbers of the coronaviruses in lysosomes around the time in their lifecycles that they’d be expected to be getting out of the cells to infect new ones. Furthermore, when the researchers blocked the movement of lysosomes to the plasma membrane in the MHV-infected cells, a key step in lysosome-based exocytosis, they detected much less viral RNA outside the cells. These findings indicate that β-coronaviruses use lysosomes to exit cells.
Lysosomes are typically quite acidic, with a pH around 4.5 to 5.0. This allows specialized enzymes to degrade waste within the lysosome, but not if something went wrong and these enzymes made it into the cytoplasm. The research team determined that the lysosomes were somehow being deacidified during MHV infection. Lysosomes in cells infected with MHV had an average pH of 5.7, while the uninfected control cells’ lysosomes had an average pH of 4.7, leading to reduced lysosomal enzyme activity in infected cells, which would allow the viruses to exit the cells intact.

ALAN HOOFRING, NIH
Based on previous work from other groups and the researchers’ new evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 protein ORF3a is localized to the lysosomes of infected cells, they hypothesize that it may be involved in neutralizing the pH; they are planning future studies to further investigate the protein’s role.
“We were certainly surprised that it’s using this pathway to get out,” says Altan-Bonnet. While some viruses without a lipid and protein envelope—such as reovirus, which causes mild gastrointestinal upset in people—do exit cells via lysosomal trafficking, she adds, “it’s not the typical pathway for enveloped viruses.”
Abnormal immune responses—such as the cytokine storm—can be a feature of COVID-19, and the process of lysosomal degradation had been previously shown to be critical for antigen presentation, which allows immune sentinels to identify and kill infected cells. Altan-Bonnet shared the findings with her husband, Grégoire Altan-Bonnet, an immunologist at the National Cancer Institute, and they and their colleagues hypothesized that “maybe the fact that the virus escapes from a different pathway completely messes up the normal immune response,” he says. Indeed, the research team found alterations in both antigen presentation and subsequent immune activation in MHV-infected cells, indicating that antigen presentation had been disrupted.
“Clearly, this virus is using a different pathway than what we thought previously,” says Billy Tsai, a cell biologist at the University of Michigan who did not participate in the study. Some of the open questions center on how the virus deacidifies the lysosomes and then uses the lysosome trafficking pathway, he adds, and it will also be important to see confirmation of these results from other groups. “There’s going to be a lot of excitement in trying to unravel how these viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, go through the host cells and then get out.”
In addition to the basic science questions, the research team is focusing on how their findings relate to COVID-19’s pathology. “We follow the literature from the clinical side, and people are making tons of measurements about the cytokine storm and coagulation issues, and there is really not a mechanism which explains how all these things fit together,” says Grégoire Altan-Bonnet. He and his colleagues are now exploring whether or not viral egress via lysosomes can explain the immune imbalances in patients.
The researchers are starting with MHV, in part because it’s safe to work with under biosafety level two conditions, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which requires biosafety level three. “Of course, the mouse strain is not the human strain,” says Nihal Altan-Bonnet. “Since we saw the acidification in the CoV-2 infected cells, we’re hopeful that we’re going to see the same effects across different coronaviruses.”

Common Cold Coronaviruses Tied to Less Severe COVID-19 Cases/-/ABOVE: Coronavirus OC43
DR. ERSKINE PALMER, CDC
T
here are four common cold coronaviruses that we all catch at some stage. We generate antibodies to them, but our immune memory of them fades over time, and we get re-infected.  
Their names are all too easily forgotten—OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63—but our immune systems may nevertheless remember them for a time. There have been hints that exposure to these common coronaviruses might offer some protection from COVID-19, mostly by looking at signs of immune memory in blood samples taken from before the pandemic. A study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation reports the first clinical evidence linking recent endemic coronavirus infections to less severe COVID-19 and even a reduced death rate in patients. 
“The COVID-19 disease is actually much less severe in those patients who had documented endemic coronavirus infections.”
—Manish Sagar, Boston Medical Center
The authors at Boston University School of Medicine found evidence for this by poring over the medical records of thousands of patients who had visited Boston Medical Center as inpatients or outpatients, most probably for respiratory illnesses, between 2015 and 2020. Each person had been assessed for infection using a PCR test that screens for bacteria and viruses, including the four endemic coronaviruses. 
In total, 15,928 patients had at least one such PCR test. Of them, 875 tested positive for an endemic coronavirus (this group was called eCoV+), while the remaining 15,053 people never had a documented coronavirus infection (termed eCoV-).
Of the entire cohort, a total of 1,812 (11.4 percent) later returned for a SARS-CoV-2 test during the initial COVID-19 surge in Boston between March 12 and June 12. 
“Our study is the first to examine people with known endemic coronavirus infections, and compare them to people who, as far as we know, don’t have any recent documented coronavirus infections,” says Manish Sagar, the lead author of the study and a virologist at Boston Medical Center.  
The infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was no different between those who had a recently recorded endemic coronavirus infection (eCoV+) and those who did not have a positive test (eCoV-). This led the authors to conclude that a recent infection with endemic coronaviruses did not keep SARS-CoV-2 at bay—both groups were just as likely to become infected with the pandemic virus.
When the researchers peered closer at the data, they observed an important difference between the two groups. “The COVID-19 disease is actually much less severe in those patients who had documented endemic coronavirus infections,” says Sagar. The odds of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were significantly lower in eCoV+ than in eCoV- patients, and there was “a trend towards lower odds of mechanical ventilation,” the authors write in their report.
The data also show that among hospitalized patients who had previous positive test results for endemic coronavirus, 4.8 percent of them died compared with 17.7 percent among those in the group without such a test result.
Local immune memory may help explain these results. Such “heterotypic immunity,” says immunologist Joseph Mizgerd, director of the pulmonary center at Boston University School of Medicine, occurs when immune memory is etched into the lungs and/or nose. It’s common after other types of respiratory infections and might offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 if elicited by endemic coronaviruses. Although the Boston group did not measure this type of immunity in patients, they now hypothesize that local immunity gained from endemic coronaviruses helps limit lung injury during COVID-19. “We are testing that in ongoing experiments,” Mizgerd says by email. He adds that such cross-reactive immunity is often mediated by memory T cells, which can localize in the lung, and he notes that lung-localized heterotypic T cells can prevent severe lung infection during pneumonias caused by other types of respiratory pathogens.
If indeed prior infection does ramp up protection against SARS-CoV-2, the study could not answer how long it takes for any such benefit to taper off. Nor did the work shed light on which of the four endemic coronaviruses in particular might be offering protection against the pandemic virus. The scientists are seeking funding to expand their research and include data from other institutions.
Mizgerd and his team did not look into which immune components may be responsible for an endemic coronavirus influencing a person’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This is something that immunologist Dennis Burton at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and his colleagues have investigated.  
Since the start of the pandemic, they have been interested in whether pre-existing immune responses to seasonal coronaviruses could influence antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. In a study published in September as a preprint on bioRxiv, Burton and colleagues compared serum antibodies and antibody-producing B cells from 36 donors sampled prior to the pandemic to see whether those antibodies reacted with the spike protein from the new pandemic virus. Very few antibodies from before the pandemic reacted to SARS-CoV-2, the team found. The vast majority did not bind strongly to the new virus, although they did identify one antibody that could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. 
The group also detected memory B cells in blood samples from before the pandemic that were turned on by the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This activation triggered them to make antibodies that reacted against some proteins made by SARS-CoV-2. “That would suggest that there is some cross reactivity there,” says Burton.  
“A cross-protective vaccine that protects against SARS-CoV-2 plus the endemic coronaviruses would be a really great boon.”

A recent Science study reported that 5 percent of 302 adults and 43 percent of 48 children had antibodies that reacted against certain proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2. Children are more prone to common cold coronavirus infections, perhaps explaining why they might harbor such antibodies, and why they suffer less severe COVID-19 symptoms.
“We do not know yet if the presence of such antibodies modifies the risk of becoming infected or the severity of disease,” senior author George Kassiotis at the Francis Crick Institute in London explains by email. There are conserved parts of the S2 peptide of the spike protein, such as the fusion peptide, in most coronaviruses “that are targeted by such cross-reactive and potentially cross-protective antibodies,” Kassiotis notes. This “may hold promise for a universal vaccine protecting against current, as well as future CoVs,” the authors write in their Science paper.  
Kassiotis says that concerns that “antibody immunity might be short-lived have now been allayed” by recent studies and adds that even if antibodies fell below detectable levels, “the cells that made them will still be there and will respond faster and better to re-infection.”
Antibodies and B cells are part of only one aspect of our immune memory to viruses. Multiple investigations since the beginning of the pandemic have suggested that between 20 percent and 50 percent of people who had never encountered SARS-CoV-2 had T cells that nevertheless seemed to react against peptides from this virus, as noted recently in a Science paper.
In another study in Nature, researchers in Singapore identified memory T cells in patients who had recovered from SARS back in 2003. These were reactive to proteins from SARS-CoV-2, supporting the idea that T cell memory from infections with human coronaviruses may play a role in the response to an infection with the new pandemic virus.  
An additional study recently published in Science used human blood samples from before the pandemic to locate parts of SARS-CoV-2 that stimulated existing T cells. The study found a range of memory T cells that could react to both the new virus and to the four common cold coronaviruses, again suggesting that existing T cells against common coronaviruses could play a role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in some patients. 
Immunologist Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa who was not involved in any of these studies says that “everybody should have memory B cells against common cold coronaviruses.” We may also have memory T cells that remember these viruses and perhaps help with fighting SAR-CoV-2. However, Perlman emphasized that the implication of this for COVID-19 “is still a work in progress.” 
Burton says he hopes to dig into a molecular understanding of the cross-reactivity of antibodies, which might help design a vaccine against not just SARS-CoV-2, but common cold coronaviruses too. These viruses usually cause mild symptoms, but not always. 
“A cross-protective vaccine that protects against SARS-CoV-2 plus the endemic coronaviruses would be a really great boon,” says Sagar. “These coronaviruses are causes of the common cold, but they are also really important causes of pneumonia, pneumonia hospitalizations, and pneumonia deaths.”

Q&A: Pollution Linked to 15 Percent Increase in COVID-19 Deaths/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FATIDO
A
s the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the globe early in the spring of 2020, researchers began investigating how air pollution, which has been known for decades to have deleterious effects on human health, could be affecting this respiratory disease. Inspired by the work of a group of researchers in the US who reported in April that high levels of air pollution correlated to a higher risk of dying from COVID-19, Jos Lelieveld, an atmospheric chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and others widened their scope, looking at more areas of the world. 
The danger of pollution to respiratory health comes from tiny emissions particles that are inhaled. Fine particulate matter is defined as anything smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). The smaller the particles, the further down the respiratory system they can get, causing big problems by way of oxidative stress and an exuberant inflammatory response. Some particles can even trigger apoptosis. Short-term exposure to particle-laden air can cause acute irritation, leading to a cough, while long-term exposure is linked to chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), heart disease, and cancer.
A study published in Cardiovascular Research on October 26 claims that fine particulate matter has increased the risk of deaths from COVID-19 by 15 percent globally, with certain areas such as East Asia reaching a 27 percent increase. The Scientist talked to Lelieveld to learn more about the relationship between pollution and COVID-19.

COURTESY OF JOS LELIEVELD
TS: Why do these particles leave people more vulnerable to dying from COVID-19?
JL: You have long-term effects [when people are] exposed for basically a lifetime to air pollution and then they develop chronic diseases. . . . These diseases are also preconditions for severe development of COVID-19. . . . Many of the lung diseases like pneumonia, COPD, lung cancer, heart disease, strokes, [are] the sort of thing that are aggravated by air pollution. And these are the sorts of things that also make people die from COVID. A healthy, young subject who has not been developing chronic diseases typically does not die from COVID.
TS: What can someone who lives in a place with more air pollution do to reduce their exposure to these particles?
JL: We write in our paper that there is no remedy like vaccinations for air pollution, so the only remedy here is that you have to clean the air. You have to go to cleaner sources of fuels and cleaner fuels and cleaner energy use. And of course, this also helps the climate. There are many arguments to do this. . . . I’m convinced that climate change is a big problem for this planet. And what I’m hoping is that some of the people who think it’s not an issue [that] carbon dioxide makes the world a bit warmer, maybe I can help convince them by showing that the same sources that create greenhouse gases are also creating pollutants that make you ill.
TS: Can you tell me how you collected your data and designed the study?
JL: We used the data from the paper attached to calculate PM2.5 exposure-response functions, plus data from China collected for the SARS epidemic in 2003. We tested different types of these functions, leading to the same result. To characterize exposure, we used a combination of satellite data and an atmospheric model, the latter to compute the anthropogenic fraction of PM2.5 and the contribution of fossil fuel use.
TS: Are there benchmarks of PM2.5 levels that correspond to low or high risk?
JL: There is a threshold of 2.4 µg/m3 below which the air is considered “clean”, precluding health impacts.
TS: Are there certain fine particles that are worse than others?
JL: There are indications that combustion-related black and organic carbon particles are more toxic than most other particles. But this is not quantitatively known, hence it is common practice to assume that all fine particulates are equally toxic.
TS: How long do fine particles stay with a person after they leave a highly polluted area?
JL: The atmospheric lifetime of aerosol particles is about one week. Once inhaled and deposited in the lungs, the damage is done (much like smoking). The cumulative damage during many years of exposure causes or aggravates chronic cardiopulmonary diseases (much like smoking), which are preconditions that influence the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.

Pfizer’s COVID-19 Vaccine 90 Percent Effective: Initial Data/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
TERO VESALAINEN
Update (November 18): After the companies concluded their Phase 3 trials and found that the vaccine is 95 percent effective in an analysis of 170 confirmed COVID-19 cases, Pfizer and BioNTech are expected to seek emergency authorization from global regulators within days. The results put the vaccine on par with competitor Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, which was found on Monday to be 94.5 percent effective in a preliminary analysis of 95 participants.
P
reliminary data from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotechnology firm BioNTech show that their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90 percent effective at protecting people from the infection, compared to patients who received a placebo saline shot, according to a Pfizer statement today (November 9).
“I’ve been in vaccine development for 35 years,” William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, tells STAT. “I’ve seen some really good things. This is extraordinary.” He added, “This really bodes well for us being able to get a handle on the epidemic and get us out of this situation.”
While it’s unclear exactly how many of the trial’s 43,000 participants, who received either two doses of the vaccine or the placebo, have contracted COVID-19, the interim analysis includes 94 confirmed cases. Among these 94, roughly 10 percent had been given the vaccine, while the other 90 percent had been given a placebo.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells the Associated Press the results suggesting 90 percent efficacy are “just extraordinary. Not very many people expected it would be as high as that.”
Scientists have warned that a COVID-19 vaccine may be only as good as an influenza vaccine, which is about 50 percent effective and requires yearly shots. Earlier this year, Fauci said he would be excited by a COVID-19 vaccine that was 75 percent effective. 
If the final vaccine ends up with that level of efficacy, it “would be higher than your regular flu vaccine, and this vaccine could have a serious impact on bending the curve of this outbreak,” Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health who is not involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, tells The New York Times.
The companies have not yet released the full results of the analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed by outside experts or published in a medical journal. There is also no information yet on the severity of the infections among those who were vaccinated.
See “Trials Unlikely to Show if COVID-19 Vaccine Prevents Severe Cases”
“If that headline number really holds up, that is huge. That is much better than I was expecting, and it will make a huge difference,” Ashish Jha, the dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University who is not involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, tells STAT. He adds that it is difficult to evaluate science from a press release and that he looks forward to reviewing the full results.
Pfizer plans to continue its study until it records 164 infections among all the volunteers to demonstrate its efficacy in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) guidelines. FDA officials require any COVID-19 vaccine to be at least 50 percent effective to consider approval. 
Members of the independent data monitoring board that reviewed the results found no serious safety concerns. They reported similar side effects to an earlier study of the vaccine that was posted in August on a preprint server: pain at the injection site, fatigue, chills, and fever—which occurred more frequently in older and younger trial participants than in those aged 18–65.
If a vaccine is authorized, initial supplies will be scarce and rationed, with priority likely to be given to front-line workers such as healthcare employees. Pfizer has estimated that it could make available 50 million doses globally by the end of 2020, which would vaccinate 25 million people because it’s administered in two doses.
Doctors Consider Convalescent T Cell Therapy for COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

P
hysicians and researchers have had questionable success treating patients with severe COVID-19 with either antibody-based drugs or convalescent plasma. Neither of those strategies is a cell-based therapy, and, in a preprint posted October 26 on bioRxiv, researchers propose collecting SARS-CoV-2–specific memory T cells from recovered individuals, banking the cells, and infusing them into patients as a treatment for infections.
“There are data now that are coming out from the analysis of the immune response that are suggesting that the T cells are more important for protection than antibodies,” says Antonio Bertoletti, who studies the development of immunological therapies at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and did not participate in the work. There is therefore a rationale to use T cells to control the disease, he adds.
Previously, researchers had attempted memory T cell therapy to suppress cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The recipients were leukemia patients who received a stem cell transplant to treat their cancer at the same time. It was this success, combined with the T cell findings from COVID-19 patients, that led Antonio Pérez-Martínez, a pediatrician at Hospital Infantil Universitario La Paz in Madrid, and his colleagues to consider a cell-based treatment for the coronavirus.
The researchers isolated memory T cells, including some that released interferon gamma, a cytokine necessary for anti-viral immunity, upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, from the blood of people who recovered from COVID-19. They showed that it was possible to freeze, store, and thaw these cells and propose that biobanks of memory T cells could be created from convalescent donors to be infused to treat disease. The practice of storing convalescent plasma, which includes antibodies but no immune cells, to treat COVID-19 patients is already in wide use, although with mixed data on its utility.
“If you give plasma and antibodies, those antibodies could potentially fight COVID, but they are not produced in that person, so they are just have a normal half-life and they are cleared,” says Rory de Vries, an immunologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands who did not participate in the study. But when T cells encounter a virus, “they start expanding, and you might actually build your own new immunological memory while you’re doing that, which will never happen with plasma.”
Despite the theoretical potential, “it’s not an easy approach,” de Vries cautions. For one thing, the authors “don’t only store SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, they store every memory cell, so that means that you also store your memory for measles or . . . previous vaccinations,” he tells The Scientist. “And if you infuse these T cells, I don’t think we really know what might happen.”
In a cell-based treatment, there are also concerns about immunological compatibility of the donor and recipient, just as there would be during an organ transplant, de Vries explains. The authors did characterize memory T cells based on human leukocyte antigens (HLA), molecules responsible for the immune system’s ability to distinguish self and non-self. But de Vries cautions that HLA diversity is vast, potentially requiring more extensive characterization than the authors have done in the preprint to make the treatment safe.
According to Pérez-Martínez, the HLA matching is sufficient because patients with severe COVID-19 have lymphopenia, a dearth of white blood cells called lymphocytes, a subtype of which are T cells. Lymphopenia is a biological marker of severe COVID-19, he says. The patients who are more lymphopenic have a greater chance of ending up in the ICU and eventually dying.
The lymphopenia triggered by the coronavirus is similar to the lymphopenia induced by chemotherapy drugs in patients before a stem cell transplant, so the transplant won’t be rejected, he explains. This “lymphopenic window” during COVID-19 is the time at which it could be possible to replace a patient’s missing lymphocytes with SARS-CoV-2-responsive T cells from recovered donors. The idea is that lymphopenic patients don’t have enough of their own T cells, so they’re not going to reject donor lymphocytes.
See “The Immune Hallmarks of Severe COVID-19”
This strategy “is complicated and needs some work,” says Bertoletti. “It could be that for a short time . . . when you are introducing these T cells in a patient, they will be basically able to suppress viral replication and kill the infected cells,” he adds, but the unanswered questions of how important HLA matching is and what the appropriate timing for such a treatment complicates matters.
In order to test the safety of the treatment, Pérez-Martínez and colleagues are beginning a Phase I clinical trial in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with lymphopenia. In the transplant setting, doctors have not seen any side effects, he says, “so I think that it’s worth it to try.”

Denmark to Cull 17 Million Mink Amid SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Concerns/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KONSTANTIN SOKOLOV

ccording to government officials in Denmark, mink raised on Danish farms carry a mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is less sensitive to antibodies, which they say might thwart vaccine development. Minks readily host and spread the virus and because this strain has now been found in humans, the prime minister announced on November 4 that Denmark would cull the entire stock of its mink farms, which equates to about 17 million animals spread across 1,000 farms. 
So far, five human cases of this strain are linked to mink farms, and 12 people have become infected in all. According to reports, the Danish government has shared its findings with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. “We have been informed by Denmark of a number of persons infected with coronavirus from mink, with some genetic changes in the virus,” a representative from the WHO tells Reuters. “The Danish authorities are investigating the epidemiological and virological significance of these findings.”
The full genetic details of this strain and the serological findings of patients have not been published yet.
“Someone would have to release the sequences soon, and the evolutionary biologists will be all over it,” Jonathan Epstein, the vice president of science and outreach at EcoHealth Alliance who was not involved with the government report, tells The New York Times.
According to the prime minister, this strain makes it harder for the body to create antibodies against it, possibly undermining vaccines currently in development, although there is no evidence to show that is the case.
Denmark has had hundreds of COVID-19 cases tied to mink farms throughout the pandemic, and the cull will now follow in the footsteps of similar efforts to reduce transmission through minks in Spain and the Netherlands. As Denmark leads the world in mink production, it will have to kill 150 times as many animals as the other countries, which will likely crash the industry for years to come, according to The Guardian. 
“We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference Wednesday, Reuters reports.
A letter published in Science on October 30 calls for the ban of what is described as “unsustainable mink production” in Denmark and other countries. While the letter mainly focuses on COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide linked to mink farms, it also cites other zoonotic diseases that mink are known to harbor.
According to the BBC, ongoing studies are trying to determine why minks are such good hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
Scientists Probe Blockers for the Coronavirus Spike Protein/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DESIGN CELLS
T
he pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 must break into our cells to set up an infection. It gains entry using the now notorious spike protein but, typical of viruses, it must hijack our own biology to jimmy the lock. Scientists are figuring out ways to intercept the virus before it can break in.
Viral spike proteins rely on protein-chomping enzymes, proteases, to re-shape them for cellular entry. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike must first be snipped at a specific point by the furin protease before it latches onto a cell’s ACE2 receptor. Then, another protease must cut the spike protein and initiate viral fusion with the cell membrane.
The idea that researchers are pursuing is to block furin from cutting the spike.
Early on, before COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic, scientists were already on the furin case, observing that the spike protein had amino acid sequences that looked worryingly like a furin docking site, with a motif of arginine-arginine-alanine-arginine. Furin is a widespread enzyme in the body, potentially granting SARS-CoV-2 countless opportunities to infect cells. SARS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak earlier this century, does not have a furin cleavage site, but such sites are present in other dangerous pathogens such as HIV, Ebola, MERS-CoV, and avian influenza.
The hunt for furin inhibitors to use clinically is well underway.
“There are some highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, which occasionally infect people, and their spikes are cleaved by furins, so those viruses can reproduce in a number of different cells and tissues in the body,” explains Vincent Racaniello, a virologist at Columbia University. This separates them out from annual human influenza viruses, whose spikes are not cleaved by furin, and may partly explain why those viruses are not as pathogenic as bird flus are.
If furin is critical to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to enter different cell types, then blocking the protease might hinder viral replication. To this end, researchers have been investigating whether furin is truly essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether interfering with its activity lowers viral loads in cells.
Furin as SARS-CoV-2’s partner in crime
In May, a group at the Germany Primate Centre led by Stefan Pöhlmann reported that initial cleavage of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human lung cells and for the virus to fuse infected cells with other cells. This fusion phenomenon, called syncytium, is driven by the so-called fusion peptide that is released by the spike as it is cleaved.
A French group reported that cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 are studded with spike proteins, which fuse with neighbors sporting ACE2 surface enzymes. Fused cells have been seen in postmortem lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This cell-cell fusion has also been observed in tissues from people infected with the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS.    
Syncytium allows virus-infected cells join other cells, creating contiguous viral factories of 10 to 20 cells. The strategy enables the virus to hijack new cells without exiting into the body, thus eluding immune surveillance. The French group concluded that cell-cell fusion is a feature of severe COVID-19 and is facilitated by TMPRSS2, another protease involved in snipping the spike protein.
Another German group reported in July evidence backing TMPRSS2’s importance in infection and that SARS-CoV-2 replication was strongly inhibited by a synthetic furin inhibitor, MI-1851, in human airway cells.
In a preprint posted to bioRxiv in August, Vineet Menachery of the University of Texas Medical Branch and his colleagues reported that deletion of the spike protein’s furin cleavage site from SARS-CoV-2 ramped up replication in a monkey cell line, but attenuated replication in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo in hamsters.
“My expectation would be that the same holds true for SARS-CoV-2 in infected human patients,” Pöhlmann says of the hamster result. As for the conflicting data from the monkey cells, the researchers are still looking for answers.
The search for a drug to block furin
The hunt for furin inhibitors to use clinically is well underway. Scientists in Taiwan tested four inhibitors of furin and other similar proteases in human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage and cell-cell fusion were abolished in those cells treated with the furin inhibitors CMK (decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone) and naphthofluorescein, the authors reported in September in Cell. CMK is a peptide inhibitor long used as a research tool that competes with furin for SARS-CoV-2’s attention, while naphthofluorescein, a newer compound used in research, is a small molecule inhibitor of furin’s activity.
“These two inhibitors decrease not only syncytium, but also viral production,” says senior author Shiou-Hwei Yeh of National Taiwan University Hospital. “Our study confirms the critical role of furin cleavage for fusion activity of the spike protein, but we also identified two antiviral lead compounds for drug development.”
Yeh has developed a number of derivatives of naphthofluorescein to increase its selectivity for furin. She now plans to test her derivatives in mouse models that express human ACE2.
Gonzalo Izaguirre, a biochemist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied natural furin inhibitors called serpins for many years. He is now working on an engineered serpin-type furin inhibitor that can block cell entry by a synthetic, noninfectious virus fitted with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. “If effective,” he notes by email, “this inhibitor could be the basis of a potential therapy to treat COVID-19.” 
There are already protease-inhibiting drugs approved for unrelated conditions that seem to affect furin, which biochemist Richard Watt of Brigham Young University in Utah says would be worth investigating for possible repurposing to treat COVID-19. For instance, nelfinavir is a drug approved to treat HIV that Watt says affects furin. In an unrelated study on anemia, “we found that an HIV protease inhibitor could bind furin and inhibits its action,” explains Watt.
Plenty of drugs have been developed with the aim of inhibiting furin, but none have made it through to patients.
The drug tightly binds to the catalytic site of furin and also to other proteases that act on SARS-CoV-2, computational studies from his group and others show, says Watt. Also, an earlier preprint noted that nelfinavir does seem to act against SARS-CoV-2, by binding to its main protease.
Yet another strategy could be to combine a furin blocker with a second protease inhibitor, such as for TMPRSS2. In a July preprint, Pöhlmann and colleagues concluded that TMPRSS2 was essential for SARS-CoV-2 to infect human airway cells, and suggested combining a TMPRSS2 and a furin inhibitor as an antiviral strategy.
“Furin is an essential enzyme in the human body. You cannot live without furin,” says Pöhlmann. “TMPRSS2 is not essential, at least in mice, which can live happily without it.” The combination of two inhibitors could allow for a lower dose of a furin blocker, or a faster one-two punch, thereby necessitating only a brief inhibition of furin.
“You would want inhibitors of both furin and TMPRSS2,” agrees Watt. He suggests this may be feasible using nelfinavir in combination with camostat mesilate, a TMPRSS2 blocker approved in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and which Pöhlmann had reported can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 activation. There are a number of approved inhibitors of TMPRSS2 for conditions unrelated to coronaviruses. Moreover, a Danish trial is currently testing the effect of camostat in COVID-19 patients.
Repurposing approved drugs to block proteases essential for the virus would allow for faster clinical trials to test their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps benefit COVID-19 patients through new, much needed antiviral therapies. Watt would like to trial nelfinavir in COVID-19 patients, but has yet to find a clinical collaborator or funding.
The limitations of interfering with furin
Not everyone is convinced that blocking furin will work. A group in the UK reported in a preprint in August that crippling the gene for furin in a human embryonic cell line diminishes, but does not altogether stop, replication of SARS-CoV-2. “We found that deleting the gene for furin slowed cell-cell fusion but did not prevent it,” immunologist Leo James of the University of Cambridge explains by email.
“The fact that the S protein was still cleaved in furin knockout cells suggest that there may be other proteases that can take its place, albeit less efficiently,” he adds. On the face of it, these results are bad news for generating antivirals that block furin. “Even if a compound achieves 100% inhibition it will not completely prevent infection,” James says. A June study in iScience similarly suggested that enzymes related to furin could also cut the spike protein.
Still, that need not be the last word. “I would say that they haven’t used the right cells,” counters Racaniello. Cell lines from monkeys and human embryo cells can tap different proteases to do the same job as furin, he adds, setting them apart from human lung cells.
Furthermore, Racaniello and others say it may not be necessary to entirely lock SARS-CoV-2 out of cells. “Clearly, if you take away this cleavage site the virus can still reproduce to a certain extent,” says Racaniello. “It could be that a ten- or one-hundred-fold reduction in virus output is enough to prevent infection, and you cannot tell that from a cell line. You need to look in an animal model.”
A separate problem “is that furin has essential roles in our cell,” says Racaniello, so if you block the enzyme, “you will have toxicity associated with that.” Plenty of drugs have been developed with the aim of inhibiting furin, but none have made it through to patients. “Furin inhibitors are quite toxic,” confirms Izaguirre.
This does not rule them out. Inhibitors could perhaps be delivered for a short period of time to knock down viral load at a critical juncture. “It might be possible that furin inhibitors are only applied for a very short amount of time, to limited unwanted side effects,” agrees Pöhlmann.
Although nelfinavir is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating HIV, it has not yet been approved as a furin inhibitor. Watt is currently seeking FDA approval for nelfinavir as a furin inhibitor to treat anemia caused by chronic inflammation in hopes that future studies will allow the drug to be approved as a furin inhibitor for other indications such as SARS-CoV-2 infections.  
Paper Proposing COVID-19, Magnetism Link to Be Retracted/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ALXPIN
Update (November 5): The study is now marked as temporarily removed from Elsevier’s site.
A
peer-reviewed paper suggesting that COVID-19 is caused not by SARS-CoV-2 but by magnetic anomalies will be retracted, the study’s first author and an editor from the journal that published it tell The Scientist. The study, “Can Traditional Chinese Medicine provide insights into controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: Serpentinization-induced lithospheric long-wavelength magnetic anomalies in Proterozoic bedrocks in a weakened geomagnetic field mediate the aberrant transformation of biogenic molecules in COVID-19 via magnetic catalysis,” was posted on the website of the Elsevier publication Science of the Total Environment on October 8, but attracted widespread criticism beginning on October 29, leading the University of Pittsburgh–based authors to request the retraction.
“A paper like this gets out there, it’s published in some supposedly peer-reviewed journal—it makes the rest of the field look stupid,” says Joe Kirschvink, a Caltech geobiologist whose research areas include sensing of magnetic fields by humans and other animals. “And that’s a harmful thing.”
The study’s first author, Moses Bility, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health who studies infectious disease, tells The Scientist that the origin for the research came late last year, when a few rats in his lab unexpectedly became very ill and had to be sacrificed. “I’ve been working with animals since my undergraduate days,” he says, and hadn’t before seen an instance where “in the matter of 12 hours, a healthy animal, just drops, can’t breathe.” Examining the rats’ tissues in search of an explanation, Bility saw changes to their lungs and kidneys that he thought were similar to injuries he’d read about in humans that were ascribed to vaping. 
Bility began to suspect that there was a connection between the human vaping injuries and the pathology in the rats, which he suggests both stemmed from iron oxides in the lungs. “My argument was that the iron oxide that’s been deposited in these individuals’ lungs [from vaping] is somehow interacting with the lithospheric magnetic field,” he says. “And that’s triggering this process called magnetic catalysis, basically, it has to do with spin chemistry. And in our animals, somehow there’s some dysregulation—because they’re immunodeficient animals—in their iron that allows that same interaction to occur.” 
Bility posted a preprint to ResearchGate in November of last year laying out the idea. Asked why, if it was linked to immunodeficiency, the same phenomenon was not reported in immunodeficient humans, he says, “I don’t know all the answers,” adding, “I don’t know how well people have been looking.”
The group then had more rats die with the same pathology in February and March of this year, Bility says, and he connected the timing—close to the spring equinox, which he says is associated with changes in the geomagnetic field—to that of rising COVID-19 case numbers in the US. In the paper, he and his coauthors propose that SARS-CoV-2 is a preexisting, endogenous virus in the human genome that is reawakened by the effects of changes in the Earth’s magnetic field, but that the virus doesn’t cause the pathology seen in COVID-19. Rather, they suggest, the disease comes about due to other chemical reactions in the body catalyzed by the magnetic field. Asked whether the SARS-CoV-2 sequence has been found in the human genome, Bility says, “I’m not a genomic expert. That was just something I did want to look at, but I did not look at that.”
Kirschvink says the paper contains multiple basic errors. For example, while very strong magnetic fields can indeed influence chemical reactions, the long-wavelength anomalies that are central to the study’s thesis are “three or four orders of magnitude off” from what would be required for such effects, he says. “This results section is a salad of different ideas taken out of context.”
The study also suggests, without experimental evidence, that jade amulets might protect wearers by countering the effects of the long-wavelength anomalies, an idea Bility says he based on records of practices by ancient people in China and elsewhere during a period when geomagnetic conditions were similar to what they are now. Kirschvink says the study’s description of jade’s magnetic properties is incorrect, and that in jade, “the paramagnetic minerals are so weakly magnetized, they’re not going to do anything in these fields.”
Kirschvink says he’s heard from fellow geomagnetics researchers who “are upset that their data is being used in a nonsensical way” in the paper. 
The study has also attracted derision on Twitter and PubPeer. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine extracellular vesicle researcher Kenneth Witwer was among those who criticized the paper on PubPeer, writing in part, “Almost all symptoms were restricted to Room Number 1 of two adjacent rooms in Pittsburgh, suggesting that some agent such as an undetected pathogen was responsible for symptoms. Effects of the earth’s magnetic field would presumably be similar in side-by-side rooms at the same facility.”
Witwer also wrote an email with the subject line “virus denialism article: were you really involved?” on Friday to the paper’s senior authors, Yue Chen and Jean Nachega of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. In it, he calls the article “pseudoscience” and urges the authors to retract it immediately, adding that, “I have also written to the department heads about this serious situation.” Bility provided the email to The Scientist as an example of what he called an “online mob” that “has been attempting to damage my career and that of my colleagues.” 
For his part, Witwer writes in an email to The Scientist, “The academy needs to be vigilant against pseudoscience and giving a voice to it.” He’s concerned, he writes, that having such a paper published by scientists “with real NIH funding and at a preeminent university” might appear to validate specious claims that COVID-19 arises from some cause other than SARS-CoV-2, which he compares to similar claims in the past about HIV/AIDS that “led to public health disaster.”
Through a university spokesperson, Nachega declined to comment on the matter. Bility says that in light of the blowback his work has received, he regrets including his coauthors on the paper, and he takes full responsibility for its ideas. His intention, he says, was not to undermine public health officials, but to propose a hypothesis for further discussion and investigation, and he plans to resubmit the paper as a sole author and without mentions of jade amulets or traditional Chinese medicine.
Both Witwer and Kirschvink say the paper’s publication represents a failure of peer review. According to Damià Barceló, the editor at Science of the Total Environment who handled the submission, it had two reviewers, a hydrogeologist and an epidemiologist-toxicologist. In an email to The Scientist yesterday, he wrote that he expects the retraction will take hours or days to appear in Elsevier’s system, and that the resubmitted paper will need to be sent for peer review again before a final decision is made about its acceptance.
The Many Model Systems of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: A golden Syrian hamster

arlier this year, as transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, started to pick up speed, researchers around the world hurried to find model systems that could provide insight into disease spread, host immune responses, and possible treatments.
“When the pandemic first started, nobody really knew what was going to be the best model,” says Amanda Martinot, a veterinary pathologist at Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.
The most widely available candidates were mice, which are easily housed and so well-researched that there are tons of tools available for studying nearly every aspect of their biology. But as researchers suspected, based on previous incompatibility of mice and other coronaviruses, the animals present challenges when it comes to studying SARS-CoV-2. The virus uses a human receptor called ACE2 to get into cells, but mouse ACE2 is different enough that the virus doesn’t readily bind it.
Scientists have overcome the issue using two separate strategies: generating transgenic animals that express the human receptor and modifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus to make it better able to bind mouse ACE2.
Even with the success of those approaches, investigators have also been on the lookout for other options. Ferrets, for instance, are useful for studying viral transmission and viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and have been used by several groups for SARS-CoV-2 experiments. Some researchers have also turned to hamsters, which have been used in the past to study other viruses, including the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.
“Hamsters are known in virology for their permissiveness to all kinds of viral infection really, and, as a rule of thumb, I would say if something doesn’t work in a mouse, you may as well try a hamster,” says Jakob Trimpert, a postdoc at the Free University of Berlin. “And if you’re lucky, it works there.” Along with collaborators, he’s been using several species of hamsters to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and potential therapeutics.
The hamster ACE2 receptor is compatible with SARS-CoV-2, and the animals develop clear clinical indicators of disease, he explains. For instance, Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), one of the hamster species most commonly used in virus research worldwide, get mild SARS-CoV-2 infections, but their main symptom—weight loss—is reproducible and possible to measure. These animals also have severe pneumonia that is detectable via lung pathology. Trimpert and his colleagues used both transcriptomics and proteomics to evaluate the animals’ immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a study they published on July 20.

AMANDA MARTINOT, TUFTS CUMMINGS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
“Hamsters have been the best model so far for showing us any clinical disease,” says Martinot. “They develop weight loss, and they develop a fulminant pneumonia where it’s affecting sometimes over fifty percent of their lung,” she adds. “They also will recover if given time, but the pathology we feel is more representative of what you might see in humans.” Martinot, Dan Barouch, who directs the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and other collaborators recently published a study showing that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protected against weight loss and pneumonia in Syrian hamsters.
This species, also known as the golden Syrian hamster, has some drawbacks, too, Trimpert says. They’re big, for one, weighing in at 150–160 grams fully grown, in contrast to adult mice, which tip the scales at about 30–35 grams. Syrian hamsters are also aggressive toward each other and sometimes the people taking care of them. Their size and aggression mean that they often have to be housed alone in larger cages, which makes them more expensive to keep.
The biggest issues, according to Trimpert, are the poor quality of the sequenced genome—many genes are just missing—and the lack of molecular tools that work in hamsters. To circumvent these problems, Trimpert and his colleagues are resequencing and annotating the Syrian hamster genome.
Because the weight loss in Syrian hamsters—their only easily observable clinical symptom—is quite mild, it’s also a drawback, particularly when testing therapies or vaccines, Trimpert tells The Scientist. “If you need thirty hamsters in order to get statistical significance . . . that is a huge practical problem.”
The researchers are skirting this issue by beginning work with another species, Roborovski dwarf hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii), which are smaller than mice and less aggressive than Syrian hamsters. The dwarf hamsters also get much sicker than their larger relatives following SARS-CoV-2 infection, developing massive blood clots in the lungs, which are often present in severe cases of COVID-19 in people as well. Most of these hamsters eventually die of the complications of the infection, which, according to Trimpert, indicates that they might be a good model of severe disease in humans.
Organoids in addition to animal models

JOEP BEUMER
Getting a better picture of what is happening in people is a common goal. Eric Song, an MD/PhD student in Akiko Iwasaki’s lab at Yale School of Medicine, wanted to determine what effect SARS-CoV-2 was having on the brain. He and his colleagues used a humanized mouse model, in which a promoter drives the expression of human ACE2 in epithelial cells, in a study released as a preprint earlier this year. They found that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the central nervous system in the mice, but it still wasn’t clear whether those findings translated to human patients.
To probe that question, the researchers turned to brain organoids—cultured, miniature organs that resemble the developing brain and contain neuronal and glial cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Not only did SARS-CoV-2 infect the organoids, infection also appeared to cause cell death, a finding corroborated by another study in brain organoids published by separate group September 23. Song and his colleagues also found antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with COVID-19 and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the post-mortem brains of COVID-19 patients.
The team used three complementary methods to account for the limitations of each, Song tells The Scientist. “There is room for all the different models that are in play,” he adds. With human samples, “you can only take really a snapshot of the sickest patients because that’s the only time you will be getting a post-mortem sample, but combined with the mouse and the organoid model, you’re able to study [the] kinetics and the dynamic process of viral invasion. Things like organoids really help us access tissues that we would not otherwise have access to.”
Immunologist and developmental biologist Hans Clevers of Utrecht University in the Netherlands and colleagues are leveraging that access with gut organoids. Rather than deriving the organoids from iPSCs, though, they use multipotent stem cells taken from any adult epithelial tissue. In some ways the strategy is more limited: gut epithelial cells can only make mini guts, for instance, in contrast to iPSC-derived organoids, which can become lots of different tissues. On the other hand, “they grow forever,” Clevers says. “iPSC-based organoids, you make them and then you have to use them for an experiment because they stop growing the moment you start specifying them.”
His group published a study on July 3 investigating whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can target the gut, a hypothesis based on the expression of ACE2 in the intestinal lining and the gastrointestinal symptoms that many COVID-19 patients experience. Their work in human small intestinal organoids confirmed that the virus does enter the cells of the intestinal lining, replicate, and cause changes in gene expression.
Now, Clevers and his colleagues are using organoids to test possible COVID-19 therapeutics. Chloroquine is an example of a drug that looked promising for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection when researchers tried it in conventional cell culture—in that case, cells derived from African green monkey kidneys and grown in one layer on a dish, he says. But, as they’ve shown in a new study that’s been submitted for peer review, in the gut organoid model chloroquine is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2, just as it is in patients. According to Clevers, this latest finding indicates that an extra screening step in organoids following the identification of a promising drug in a traditional cell culture system could provide another layer of information before moving into preclinical animal models or the clinic.
Cell lines are cheap, they grow fast, and most robotic strategies for screening have been designed for cells growing in two dimensions, Clevers says. “There are multiple efforts now around the world to come up with the machines to do similar high throughput screens with 3D. With the organoids, it’s a little bit more complex to analyze because they’re not flat,” he explains, but the type of organoids they generate in his lab grow quickly. He predicts that organoids will come to be used more widely because their physiology recapitulates that of humans so well, but that they’ll never replace animals.
SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates
Along with hamsters, nonhuman primates are one of the main models that researchers studying COVID-19 therapeutics use. SARS-CoV-2 readily infects primates, such as macaques, due to the compatibility of their ACE2 receptor, but they do not show disease symptoms, says Martinot. The nonhuman primate experience of COVID-19 seems to be most similar to the mildly symptomatic cases of most people who are infected, she adds. They develop regions of pathology in their lungs that are detectable with a microscope, but it’s not enough to make them sick, and observing that kind of disease in a person is unlikely because these animals are euthanized early in infection to allow researchers to track any changes.
“It would be nice to have a primate model of severe disease,” says Barouch. “Nobody has been able to develop one so far, but models are always in development.”
And symptom presentation isn’t everything. These animals are harder to access and harder to house than rodents, but “they are a wonderful model for vaccine research and for evaluating . . . the adaptive immune response to COVID-19,” Martinot says, at least in part because there are so many existing tools researchers can leverage. “Reagents that are available for evaluating the immune response [in people] work in monkeys, and so we can very carefully monitor the nonhuman primate for the development of antibodies,” cytokine responses, and T-cell responses, she adds.
“You always want to pick your best model for your specific question,” Martinot tells The Scientist. “But depending on what kind of question you’re asking, or what kind of drug you’re testing, you really have to choose the model that best fits your ability to answer those questions in a very accurate and reproducible way.”
The World Health Organization’s Research & Development Blueprint Team has been working on this since February. The team reviews progress and coordinates efforts on animal models of COVID-19 with the primary goal of advancing the development of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. On September 23, some group members and a handful of other researchers published a review detailing the work that’s been done to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals—particularly, mice, hamsters, ferrets, and nonhuman primates—and highlighting how findings in animals correspond to disease progression in people.
“The development and use of these models is not a linear process, and they’re under constant revision,” says Barouch, who is part of the WHO working group. “When there is human data, then that allows back validation or refinement of the model . . . so there has to be a continuous feedback from models to clinical trials and back.”
“In things that are so new, like SARS-CoV-2, it may well be that there is more than one useful animal model,” Trimpert says. “We should be open and flexible, especially in emergency situations like this.”
The Specter of Endothelial Injury in COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DESIGN CELLS
I
n early March, in a conference call with researchers in China, hematologist Alfred Lee, George Goshua, and others at the Yale School of Medicine were forewarned about an unusual finding in COVID-19 patients in advanced stages of the disease. Doctors were observing ischemic digits, or black fingers and toes. To Lee and Goshua, this sounded like a microvascular thrombosis, minute blood clots in small blood vessels. A few weeks later, the Yale physicians were confronted with their first COVID-19 death, ostensibly due to a major blood clot in the patient’s lung, which prompted them to set up a panel of clotting tests for COVID-19 patients.
What came back was something Lee had never seen before: levels of the von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein involved in blood clotting, were through the roof; they had surpassed the upper limit of detection of the laboratory assay the group was using. Because VWF is released from endothelial cells that line blood vessels, Lee’s natural inference was that the endothelium was somehow damaged and releasing enormous amounts of VWF that was then contributing to blood clots.
The Yale team then ran a series of screens for other markers of endothelial damage on 68 COVID-19 patients, and the results published in The Lancet Haematology in June show that proteins such as soluble P-selectin were also elevated in critically ill COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. One of the markers, soluble thrombomodulin, even correlated with how long patients stayed in the hospital and whether they died. From these data, the investigators deduced that endothelial injury is linked to disease severity in COVID-19 and that strategies geared toward palliating this damage could improve disease outcomes.
It’s impossible to say which came first—the coronavirus infection or the endothelial damage, which is a known feature of diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases, notes Miriam Merad, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York who was not involved in the study. Conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and aging—comorbidities present among Lee’s COVID-19 patients—could have also played a part in the vascular damage, she adds. Still, “I think studying the vasculature is very important [in COVID-19],” she tells The Scientist.
Goshua comments that to be able to see an endothelial cell signal despite having only one blood sample per patient was something quite profound. In fact, researchers have come to view the vasculature as the tissue most vulnerable to damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection, Thomas Lüscher, a cardiologist at Imperial College London who has been studying the endothelium for more than three decades, tells The Scientist. “The concept that the endothelium is the main target of this virus is really very important.” Endothelial cells in the lungs play a central role in orchestrating damage to this organ, which is the chief target of the SARS-CoV-2.

The endothelium as a common theme in COVID-19
The endothelium comprises a single layer of cells that forms the interior lining of blood vessels throughout the body. The tissue physically insulates blood elements from the highly thrombogenic, or clot-promoting, subendothelial connective tissue. In addition, under normal conditions, blood cells flow past without getting stuck because of the balance between the pro- and anti-clotting properties of the endothelium. 
“The endothelium is like Teflon. Nothing sticks to it,” Harvard Medical School’s Denisa Wagner tells The Scientist. But just as a Teflon pan becomes sticky when scratched, a host of factors—including viral infection and encounters with agents of inflammation—makes it sticky. Such insults trigger endothelial release of VWF, which tethers platelets—cells involved in clotting—to the vessel wall, while the elevation of P-selectin causes leukocytes or immune cells to stick to the endothelium as well. This sets in motion a cascade of events that drives clot formation and inflammation—two defining features of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
See “Autopsies Indicate Blood Clots Are Lethal in COVID-19”
Pathology and autopsy studies have found particles of SARS-CoV-2 inside endothelial cells, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the endothelium plays a key role in the disease. In the early days of the pandemic, doctors discovered that damage to the endothelial lining in the lungs was associated with the fluid leakage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Following this, researchers linked blood clots in the lungs and elsewhere to endothelial injury, and studies found viral particles in endothelial cells in organs other than the lungs, such as the kidneys. Thus, damage to the endothelium and the ensuing clotting and inflammation emerged as potential drivers of the strokes, cardiac injury, kidney disease, and other features of the disease. 
Researchers have come to view the vasculature as the tissue most vulnerable to damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
“The protean manifestations of COVID-19 strongly implicate activation and dysfunction of the endothelium” as a unifying consequence of infection, “which can help us frame our thinking about the disease [mechanism],” says Peter Libby, a cardiovascular specialist at Harvard Medical School who has been studying the endothelium for nearly 40 years. He adds that this hypothesis “helps [us] understand why this disease so perniciously affects so many different organ systems.”
This hypothesis has been primarily based on clinical observations. Lee’s finding of high VWF levels and another study from Western University’s Douglas Fraser offer the best mechanistic evidence. Fraser and his colleagues tracked endothelial markers in 10 ICU patients with COVID-19, 10 ICU patients who were hospitalized for other reasons, and 10 healthy controls. The team found results similar to Lee’s investigation, such as raised plasma VWF and soluble P-selectin levels. In addition, Fraser and his colleagues noted telltale signs of damage to the glycocalyx, a moss-like molecular coating that envelops the endothelium, in COVID-19 patients.
Aaron Petrey, an immunologist and glycobiologist at the University of Utah School of Medicine, says that glycocalyx degradation and shedding is a theme in sepsis—which can occur in COVID-19—so “it’s unclear if this is a unique feature of COVID-19.”
Wagner, who has studied the endothelium for close to 40 years, tells The Scientist that both studies are a very good beginning to studying the endothelium in COVID-19. She says the finding that VWF is majorly increased is particularly noteworthy. “That, I think, is super important” to the increased tendency for clotting seen in COVID-19 patients.
Fraser, who published the results in August, says keeping close watch on endothelial cell markers and glycocalyx degradation could aid doctors in treating COVID-19 patients, alerting them to when it’s time to deploy medical interventions such as ventilators. Libby adds that these endothelial indicators also give doctors tools to assess which patients are likely to develop a blood clot and therefore should be treated with appropriate medications, such as blood thinners.
See “Could Statins Reduce the Severity of COVID-19?”
A few other reports from France, Germany, and China that have looked at various markers of endothelial and glycocalyx damage, both in vitro and in vivo, link endothelial damage to the severity of disease. All these studies bear witness to the endothelial cell dysfunction of COVID-19. 
Lüscher, who was not involved in any of these studies, says these interrogations of the endothelium “are stimulating, but they are not solving the problem yet. What’s the first step that initiates this cascade of events? That’s the real question—that hasn’t been solved yet.”

Endothelium-directed therapies in COVID-19
A motley of studies are looking at ways to restore endothelial integrity in COVID-19 patients using various agents, including P-selectin blockers. Targeting the complement cascade—an inflammatory pathway that causes endothelial dysfunction—is another approach in clinical testing, with one exploratory Phase 2 trial recently attesting to the safety and tolerability of anti-complement therapy and reporting early efficacy signals.
Breaking up strings of VWF is yet another tactic that might work, says Wagner. As endothelial cells release abundant amounts of VWF, the molecules can self-associate and clog small blood vessels, but an enzyme present in plasma called ADAMTS13 chops up clusters of VWF. In COVID-19, ADAMTS13 levels plummet and, along with extremely high VWF levels, portends severe disease. It’s “a recipe for trouble,” says Wagner. “I believe that supplying ADAMTS13 to COVID-19 patients with high VWF would significantly reduce thrombosis and organ damage.” Currently, recombinant ADAMTS13 is being trialled in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition where ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to excess VWF and minute clots form in small blood vessels, but so far is not being tested in COVID-19 patients.
See “Neutrophil Extracellular Traps May Augur Severe COVID-19”
Christian Con Yost, a pediatrician at the University of Utah School of Medicine, tells The Scientist that breaking down these large VWF aggregates might also tame the downstream inflammation and accumulation of platelets and leukocytes. Lee agrees that the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis is worth further investigation. “We’re looking at this very closely,” he says.
Targeting these pathways in isolation may ameliorate disease severity but is unlikely to completely attenuate disease progression.
—Jamie O’Sullivan, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland
Lüscher, Libby, and other endothelial experts assert that targeting the two primary pathways to which the endothelium is intricately linked—hyperinflammation and clotting—would be the most beneficial. Reflecting on the current status of these two types of therapies, Libby says that the clinical research field is still in the era of non-randomized observational data and that outcomes of randomized placebo-controlled trials are desperately needed.
“It’s interesting to try this but I’m not sure that [it] will be sufficient to change the course of the disease,” Lüscher says of these diverse approaches to address endothelial mayhem. “This is not a very specific infection. There are many pathways. That’s the dilemma.”
Jamie O’Sullivan, a vascular biologist at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, explains to The Scientist in an email: “Targeting these pathways in isolation may ameliorate disease severity but is unlikely to completely attenuate disease progression.”

hile researchers have observed for decades that certain vaccines seem to help recipients ward off more than just the target pathogen, only in recent years have they identified possible mechanisms for these bonus benefits. For example, in a study published this year (depicted here), researchers examined immune cells from the blood and bone marrow of healthy adults before and after they received a live tuberculosis vaccine known as bacille Calmette-Guérin, or BCG.

In the bone marrow post-vaccination, genes are expressed that trigger hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to differentiate into monocytes, neutrophils, and other so-called myeloid cells. In a separate analysis of the effects of BCG in newborns, the researchers found that the vaccine ramped up the number of neutrophils in babies’ blood compared with unvaccinated infants.

Monocytes from the blood displayed epigenetic changes after vaccination that opened chromatin harboring multiple genes involved in driving an inflammatory response, making them more accessible for transcription. Meanwhile, chromatin closed around genes associated with immune tolerance.
When exposed to the fungal pathogen Candida albicans in vitro, immune cells sampled from patients’ blood 90 days after vaccination released more of the cytokine interleukin 1β, which mediates inflammation, than did cells from blood drawn from the same individuals before vaccination.

How Some Vaccines Protect Against More than Their Targets/-/ABOVE: MODIFIED FROM © ISTOCK.COM, SOPHONK; SORBETTO

s a physician-researcher specializing in infections in newborns, Tobi Kollmann is laser focused on how to stop babies from dying. While mortality for kids under five years old has dropped substantially in recent decades, he says, there has been little improvement in the rate of deaths in the first week of life. Indeed, of the 5.2 million children under 5 years old the World Health Organization estimates died last year of preventable or treatable causes, nearly half—2.4 million—died before reaching four weeks of age, and most newborn deaths occurred in the first week after birth. Having spent time in African countries where neonatal mortality is common and witnessed the frustration of colleagues there with their limited options for preventing it, Kollmann, now at the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Australia, says he wanted to find solutions that could be implemented immediately.
So when Kollmann came across a 2011 study that found giving the tuberculosis vaccine (called bacille Calmette-Guérin, or BCG) to low-weight infants in Guinea-Bissau at birth cut their mortality rate in their first four weeks of life in half—not because of the protection it offered against tuberculosis itself, but by reducing the risk of sepsis and other infections—it caught his attention. “That to me was just unimaginable,” he says. Around 2012, Kollmann attended a meeting of researchers studying such off-target effects of vaccines and sat in on a talk by one of the authors of the 2011 study, Dutch anthropologist Peter Aaby, founder of the Bandim Health Project. Aaby spoke about the history of research on two vaccines linked to declines in all-cause mortality: BCG and the measles vaccine, which both incorporate live, attenuated pathogens. Kollmann “was just shocked how such a tool that could potentially be so incredibly effective . . . could have been kept under the wraps for so, so long.”
Trials are now underway testing the BCG vaccine to see if it can provide partial, temporary protection against COVID-19—marking the first time a vaccine has been trialed against a specific patho­gen other than the one it was designed for. 
Kollmann didn’t wait long to begin studying what he terms the pathogen-agnostic effects of BCG, coauthoring several reviews on the topic and, more recently, studying the mechanisms of the effects in animals. Other vaccines, such as the smallpox and live polio vaccines, have also yielded hints in observational studies that they could provide some protection, at least temporarily, from pathogens other than those they target. In recent years, some randomized controlled trials have provided more-solid evidence for such protections.
Despite decades of reports of vaccines’ off-target effects, however, the phenomenon has received relatively little attention, and researchers have only a nascent understanding of the mechanisms. While critics argue that some of the claims made about pathogen-agnostic effects outstrip the available evidence, Kollmann says he thinks many experts have been slow to embrace their potential of pathogen-agnostic effects because of dogmatic thinking about how the immune system works. “People think in boxes,” he says.
The question of how much protection vaccines such as BCG provide against off-target pathogens, and under what circumstances, has acquired more urgency as COVID-19 sweeps the globe. Trials are now underway testing the BCG vaccine in groups at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to see if it can provide partial, temporary protection against the novel coronavirus—marking the first time a vaccine has been trialed against a specific pathogen other than the one it was designed for. “It’s obviously very important to emphasize this does not replace a corona-specific vaccine, because, of course, that’s what the world needs,” says Nigel Curtis, a clinician and infectious disease researcher at Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne who is leading a trial of BCG for COVID-19. “But this might provide a stopgap until one comes along, because it looks like it might be many months or years before that.”
Early hints at vaccines’ off-target effects
One of the first researchers to note the apparent nonspecific effects of a vaccine was Soviet virologist Marina Voroshilova, who together with her husband Mikhail Chumakov, the director of the Polio Research Institute in Moscow, observed an unexpected benefit while spearheading large-scale testing of a new polio vaccine beginning in 1959. Unlike Jonas Salk’s famous vaccine, which used killed virus, the new, oral version, developed by Albert Sabin, used live, attenuated virus. Voroshilova and Chumakov didn’t hesitate to give the inoculation to their own children as well as to millions of other young people. Voroshilova noticed that in addition to conferring lasting protection against polio, the vaccine also seemed to be associated with lower-than-expected rates of influenza and other respiratory infections in the months after it was given, an effect backed up by later controlled trials. It wasn’t clear what explained the off-target effect, but Chumakov, Voroshilova, and their colleagues found that the vaccine raised subjects’ blood levels of interferons, proteins that instruct immune cells to launch an antiviral response.
Other studies looking into the Sabin vaccine’s effect on diseases besides polio supported this observation. And as it turned out, the oral polio immunization wasn’t unique in providing nonspecific protection. In controlled trials of the BCG vaccine conducted between 1948 and 1961 in the US and the UK, researchers found an average reduction in mortality from causes other than tuberculosis of about 25 percent among those who received the shot compared with those who did not. BCG even proved itself an early form of immunotherapy after researchers at Queen’s University in Ontario published a 1976 report of nine patients with bladder cancer who received an injection of the BCG vaccine directly into the affected organ and had a lower-than-expected recurrence rate. The vaccine is still used to treat bladder cancer today.
Another vaccine with apparent bonus protective effects was one designed to prevent measles. In the 1970s, vaccinating children in very poor countries against measles wasn’t a priority for international aid groups because, some believed, the children who died from the disease were malnourished and would have died soon of something else. But when Aaby and his colleagues visited an area of Guinea-Bissau in 1979 to investigate this hypothesis, they found that the children who died of measles weren’t more likely to be malnourished than those who survived the disease. After public health officials implemented a vaccination program with a live, attenuated measles inoculation in the area, mortality within one year among 6- to 35-month-old children declined sharply, Aaby and his team found—an effect not fully explained by the drop in measles infections. The study was not a controlled trial, however, so it remains impossible to say if the vaccine was responsible.

To examine this apparent link between the measles vaccine and non-measles mortality in other settings, Aaby and his colleagues later analyzed the results of 10 cohort and case-control studies on measles vaccination performed in seven developing countries. The drop in mortality rates after vaccination ranged from 30 percent to 86 percent, outstripping the reductions that could be explained by measles mortality rates alone. “These observations suggest that standard titre measles vaccine may confer a beneficial effect which is unrelated to the specific protection against measles disease,” the authors wrote in their 1995 BMJ paper. They detected no such effects with two other, non-live vaccines, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and a polio immunization.
It was around that time that Christine Stabell Benn, then a medical student at Aarhus University, joined Aaby’s team at the Bandim Health Project. She never left, and the pair has now studied the nonspecific effects of vaccines together for more than two decades, becoming perhaps the most visible advocates of those effects’ significance. Through further studies, largely in Guinea-Bissau, Benn and Aaby concluded that vaccines made of live, attenuated pathogens—including BCG, the live polio vaccine, and measles and smallpox immunizations—provoke beneficial nonspecific responses, while vaccines that use bits of killed virus do not. In fact, Benn suggests that non-live viruses actually make some kids temporarily more susceptible to illnesses other than the one they’ve been vaccinated against. (See “A Nonspecific Vaccine Risk?” below.)
Critics have questioned the existence and strength of nonspecific effects, both beneficial and deleterious. “A lot of the evidence is very weak,” says Paul Fine, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who has written letters in the past to journals challenging the interpretations of study results that indicate such effects. One problem with observational studies, he says, is that “vaccines in routine practice are not allocated randomly, and kids who receive vaccines, in any population in the world outside a vaccine trial, are not like the kids who don’t receive vaccines. That’s been a main issue” that can confound results, he says. 
To sort through the evidence on nonspecific effects and what implications they might have for vaccine schedules, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a working group in 2013 that included Fine, Benn, and other experts. (The WHO formulates recommendations for low- and middle-income regions, but each country develops a vaccination schedule based on its own disease threats and other circumstances.) As part of its research, the group commissioned an independent systematic review of studies on nonspecific effects of BCG, DTP, and the measles vaccine. The review identified five clinical trials of BCG, including the study of low birthweight infants in Guinea-Bissau that had caught Tobi Kollmann’s attention a few years earlier, that found a 30 percent average reduction in mortality with the BCG vaccine. The review’s authors noted that “tuberculosis is now an infrequent cause of death in infants and young children, so if BCG has an effect on all cause mortality it is unlikely to be entirely due to fewer deaths from that disease.” Similarly, the review identified four controlled trials of the measles vaccine that found an average decline in mortality of 26 percent, with deaths from measles contributing negligibly to that finding, suggesting that the vaccine also protected from other causes of death. The reviewers found no clinical trials of nonspecific effects for DTP, and all of the observational studies addressing the question were classified as having a high or very high risk of bias and generated widely varying results.
The working group concluded in 2014 that “the systematic review neither excludes nor confirms the possibility of beneficial or deleterious non-specific immunological effects of vaccines on all cause-mortality,” and also noted a lack of data on what the mechanisms for such effects might be in humans. The authors suggested that the WHO develop standard protocols for studying nonspecific effects in an ethical and rigorous way, but it’s unclear what the current status of that effort is. A WHO official told The Scientist in July that she would look into the matter but never provided the information despite several follow-up inquiries.
How Vaccines Train Innate Immunity
While researchers have observed for decades that certain vaccines seem to help recipients ward off more than just the target pathogen, only in recent years have they identified possible mechanisms for these bonus benefits. For example, in a study published this year (depicted here), researchers examined immune cells from the blood and bone marrow of healthy adults before and after they received a live tuberculosis vaccine known as bacille Calmette-Guérin, or BCG.

In the bone marrow post-vaccination, genes are expressed that trigger hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to differentiate into monocytes, neutrophils, and other so-called myeloid cells. In a separate analysis of the effects of BCG in newborns, the researchers found that the vaccine ramped up the number of neutrophils in babies’ blood compared with unvaccinated infants.

Monocytes from the blood displayed epigenetic changes after vaccination that opened chromatin harboring multiple genes involved in driving an inflammatory response, making them more accessible for transcription. Meanwhile, chromatin closed around genes associated with immune tolerance.
When exposed to the fungal pathogen Candida albicans in vitro, immune cells sampled from patients’ blood 90 days after vaccination released more of the cytokine interleukin 1β, which mediates inflammation, than did cells from blood drawn from the same individuals before vaccination.

Putting nonspecific effects of vaccines to the test
New studies on nonspecific effects have been published since the working group concluded, but a full picture of the phenomenon has not yet come into focus. In a 2017 study of low–birth weight infants in Guinea-Bissau, Benn and her colleagues found a 43 percent reduction in the mortality rate from infectious disease in the first 28 days of life among babies who received BCG soon after birth compared with those who got it at around six weeks of age, on the typical local schedule. Meanwhile, a study comparing the effects of live and non-live polio vaccine on toddlers in Bangladesh found that children who received the live vaccine experienced fewer episodes of diarrhea over the following year than did those who received the killed version. And this September, infectious diseases specialist Mihai Netea of Radboud University in the Netherlands and colleagues published interim results of a randomized trial of BCG in elderly people in Greece that showed that people who received the vaccine were less likely than controls to develop infections of any kind in the following year; BCG appeared to be most protective against respiratory viruses.
Other results complicate the case for nonspecific effects. In a Danish trial of BCG also led by Benn, there was no difference between babies who received the vaccine at birth and those who didn’t get it at all in terms of hospitalization rates for infection over the first 15 months of life—except among BCG-vaccinated children whose mothers had also been BCG-vaccinated at some point prior to their pregnancies; these babies had a 35 percent lower hospitalization rate than their non-vaccinated peers. And two trials of a different strain of the BCG vaccine in low–birth weight infants in India, one of which administered BCG along with live polio vaccine, found no effect on mortality in the first 28 days after birth.
See “An Old TB Vaccine Finds New Life in Coronavirus Trials”
Nonspecific effects have garnered some high-profile attention as a potential near-term tool for fighting COVID-19. Robert Gallo, best known for his role in identifying HIV as the cause of AIDS in the 1980s, joined with Aaby, Benn, and other authors to pen an opinion article in a June issue of Science calling for studies to determine whether the live polio vaccine could protect against COVID-19. (In rare cases, one of the three viral strains can mutate and cause disease, but Gallo suggests this could be avoided by only using the other two strains.) Gallo, a cofounder of both the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Global Virus Network, wasn’t successful in persuading the National Institutes of Health to back such trials, he says, but he’s working with partners on clinical studies outside the US, chiefly in India. Netea says he knows of 15 current trials testing BCG against COVID-19, and two each of the oral polio and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines. 
If ongoing trials demonstrate that BCG reduces the incidence or severity of COVID-19, that finding could have implications beyond the current pandemic, says Curtis. It would indicate that the inoculation could also serve as a ready-made stopgap against future outbreaks of new viruses, he notes. He adds that his current study is examining whether BCG affects rates not just of COVID-19, but also of more-familiar respiratory infections such as the flu. If so, BCG “might be something you would just use in population groups like the elderly that are more susceptible” to infection.
Potential mechanisms of vaccines’ broad protection
While observations of nonspecific effects are decades old, hints about the mechanisms that might explain the phenomenon have only begun to emerge. Vaccines are designed to train the adaptive immune system—that is, primarily the T cells that recognize and kill specific pathogens and the B cells that make antibodies—to fight off a particular infection. To do this, vaccines typically include components of the pathogen they aim to protect against, or live viruses or bacteria that are closely related to the target pathogen but don’t cause illness. So it seems counterintuitive that their effects would extend beyond that target pathogen. 
Netea, who collaborates with Benn, Aaby, and Curtis, says he thinks the lack of a mechanistic explanation for the non-specific effects seen in early studies led people to “kind of forget about it.” He himself only learned about the existing literature on such effects about a decade ago, when a student working in his lab was testing the immune response to the tuberculosis-causing bacterium after BCG vaccination. The student had used exposure to a pathogenic fungus as a control, and Netea was surprised to see that BCG helped the cells drawn from human volunteers who received the vaccine mount an immune response not only against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the fungus as well.
While observations of nonspecific effects are decades old, hints about the mechanisms that might explain the phenomenon have only begun to emerge.
To find out why this was, Netea led a larger study in which he and his colleagues again tested the blood of healthy volunteers before and after they were inoculated with BCG. Isolating pathogen-chomping innate immune cells known as monocytes and exposing them to a variety of pathogens in vitro, the team found that monocytes drawn after inoculation released 50 percent to 100 percent more of the immune cell–stimulating cytokines TNF and IL-1β. The researchers also identified specific post-inoculation changes to the methyl and acetyl tags on histones packaging the monocytes’ DNA. The authors concluded that BCG trains innate immunity via epigenetic alterations. “It’s like putting marks on the genes that are necessary for host defense,” Netea says. “Then, when you get an infection . . . those genes are marked by certain chemical modifications of the histones, and then the transcription factors can bind easier,” ramping up gene transcription to support a more robust immune response. 
His and other groups have since elucidated similar processes in other components of the innate immune system, such as natural killer cells, Netea adds. And in a study published earlier this year, he and colleagues found that BCG vaccination in adults appears to shift gene transcription patterns in immune precursor cells in the bone marrow to a program needed to form a class of leukocytes known as myeloid cells. Similarly, BCG-vaccinated newborns quickly boost production of neutrophils, a type of myeloid cell, relative to their unvaccinated peers. (See illustration.) 
Why would an infant’s immune cells need to be trained, rather than having the epigenetic marks for a robust immune response from the start? Netea says he suspects that the answer to that question has to do with the requirements of human pregnancy—namely, that the parent’s body not reject the fetus. Tamping down the parent’s immune system during pregnancy could also affect the fetus’s, he suggests, leading to babies born vulnerable to infection. 
That early vulnerability, counteracted by live-vaccine immune training, may help explain the dramatic lowering of all-cause mortality found with early BCG vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. But epigenetic effects don’t appear to be the full story on how BCG—and potentially other live vaccines—provide nonspecific protections, at least in neonates. 
In a study published earlier this year, a team led by Kollmann and Telethon Kids Institute researcher Nelly Amenyogbe (and also including Aaby and Benn) treated some newborn mice with BCG and then injected fecal bacteria into their abdomens, and into the abdomens of control animals, to simulate sepsis. They found that BCG initiated a process known as emergency granulopoiesis, which ramped up the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. These cells “sit in the bone marrow, waiting . . . to gobble up bacteria and many other things,” Kollmann says. “And then, the moment we induce sepsis in these mice that have received BCG, [the neutrophils are] released, go to the site of infection . . . and knock off these bacteria within hours of the infectious process starting.”
What most struck Kollmann was the timeline for the emergency granulopoiesis-based protection: the process began within hours of BCG inoculation, and the peak of the neutrophil-based protection came three days later. It was fast, and it lined up with the findings in the 2011 study that had first drawn his attention to pathogen-agnostic effects. The speed of the nonspecific protection also meshed with results from two other trials that compared the effects of giving BCG at birth versus later—namely, that the vaccine provides dramatic protection that begins almost immediately after inoculation. 
Kollmann says he hopes that the finding of a mechanism to back up the clinical trial data will lead to a more uniform practice of giving BCG to babies in high-risk settings immediately after birth. Longer term, he adds, more research is needed to better understand BCG’s beneficial effects. “We need to figure out: What is it about BCG that makes this happen? Can we formulate this, can we optimize this, can we make it better, faster?” 
A Nonspecific Vaccine Risk?
As a growing number of studies—epidemiological, clinical, and mechanistic—suggests that some vaccines arm the immune system for battle against pathogens other than the ones they were designed to target, a smaller and less rigorous body of evidence indicates that in some circumstances, other vaccines may do the opposite. Studies by Christine Stabell Benn and Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project and their colleagues point to non-live vaccines such as the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) shot possibly making girls—though not boys—temporarily more susceptible to illnesses other than the ones they’d been vaccinated against, Benn says. In a 2012 cohort study in Guinea-Bissau, for example, the researchers found that the group of girls who received DTP when they were two months old had more than twice the mortality rate between two and six months of age of those who hadn’t been vaccinated . But this study and others that have found a risk of increased all-cause mortality following non-live vaccines have drawn criticism for being observational, and—due to ethics concerns about delaying vaccination for experimental reasons, Benn says—no controlled trials have been published on whether such an effect exists.
In a recent study, Benn and her colleagues compared the activity of immune cells from women in the Netherlands whose most recent vaccine was DTP with those whose most recent vaccine was the tuberculosis vaccine (called bacille Calmette-Guérin, or BCG), which consists of live, attenuated bacteria and has been linked to protection against a range of infections. The cells from the former group were less responsive to non-target pathogens than the cells from women who’s had the BCG vaccine, they found, leading Benn to suspect that while live vaccines train the immune system to go after any threat more effectively, non-live vaccines train it to instead tolerate invaders other than the vaccine’s target. She doesn’t advocate for doing away with DTP and other non-live vaccines, but argues that girls, at least, should receive a live vaccine shortly after non-live jabs to retune their immune systems. “What all these studies suggest is that it would be very wise to design different vaccination programs for boys and girls,” she says.
Such potentially deleterious nonspecific effects received some attention last year with the rollout of a new malaria vaccine in a pilot program in three African countries, Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya. Benn and Aaby have voiced concerns that the vaccine, which is non-live, could increase all-cause mortality rates in girls, and they point to a post-hoc analysis of data from a Phase 3 trial that showed a higher mortality rate in infant girls who received the vaccine compared with those who didn’t. Kate O’Brien, the director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, says that study wasn’t designed to test all-cause mortality, and notes in an email to The Scientist that “the female mortality in the [malaria] vaccine arm was similar to male mortality in the control and . . . vaccine arms.” The finding of higher all-cause mortality among girls was likely due to chance, she says. Nevertheless, the WHO is monitoring all-cause mortality in the ongoing trial of the vaccine, and so far the data indicate that there is no mortality increase associated with it, O’Brien notes.

Opinion: Using Pokémon to Detect Scientific Misinformation/-/ABOVE: SONJA PINCK
O
n March 18, 2020, the American Journal of Biomedical Science & Research published my paper claiming that eating a bat-like Pokémon sparked the spread of COVID-19. This paper, “Cyllage City COVID-19 outbreak linked to Zubat consumption,” blames a fictional creature for an outbreak in a fictional city, cites fictional references (including one from author Bruce Wayne in Gotham Forensics Quarterly on using bats to fight crime), and is cowritten by fictional authors such as Pokémon’s Nurse Joy and House, MD. Nonetheless, four days after submission, editor Catherine Nichols was “cheerful to inform” me via email that it had “received positive review comments” and was accepted for publication.
They appear legitimate, but practice no peer review, no editing, not even a reality check.
It’s not the only fake paper on Pokémon I’ve had published or accepted for publication, covering creatures from Pikachu to Porygon. Some would argue that editors cannot recognize Pokémon names, but lines in the text such as “a journal publishing this paper does not practice peer review and must therefore be predatory” or “this invited article is in a predatory journal that likely does not practice peer review” would have tipped off anyone who bothered to read the articles. These papers did not slip in under the radar; they were welcomed in blindly. 
The journals that accepted my papers are predatory. They appear legitimate, but practice no peer review, no editing, not even a reality check. Publishers such as BiomedGrid (which publishes American Journal of Biomedical Science & Research), OMICS, or Longdom Publishing will accept anything so long as authors agree to pay the open access fees, which range from less than $100 to several thousand dollars. (I have not paid a penny so far, as some of these journals publish submitted manuscripts before receiving payment.) Predatory journals are just expensive blogs, no more reliable as sources of scientific information than a celebrity’s Twitter feed, yet unfortunately equally trusted in some circles.
Adapted from a figure that appeared in another paper, “Expression of the Pokemon gene and pikachurin protein in the pokémon Pikachu,” that Shelomi got published in the Academia Journal of Scientific Research this July.

To make matters worse, my Pokémon-inspired paper on the novel coronavirus has already been cited. A physicist based in Tunisia published “The COVID-19 outbreak’s multiple effects,” which claimed that COVID-19 was human-made and is treatable with “provincial herbs,” in another predatory journal, The International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology. He not only cited my article, but also cited one of my made-up references, “Signs and symptoms of Pokérus infection,” as the paper that first identified SARS-CoV-2. When I asked the author how this happened, he failed to see any problem with citing a paper he never read while writing a paper outside his field, and was unaware of the difference between open access and predatory journals. The difference—editing and peer review—is critical: when it comes to public health, fake journals are a real danger.
While evidence shows that the majority of authors publishing in predatory journals are naive researchers from developing countries, ample opportunity exists to use such venues deliberately to push fraud and misinformation. What is stopping someone, using their real name or a fake name (or your name!), from publishing a paper claiming that kale juice prevents AIDS, that vaccines cause transsexualism, that certain races are inferior, or any other equally eroneous drivel, and then publicly citing that paper as evidence? The answer is nothing. It’s been done, with quacks promoting the thoroughly debunked, fraudulent, fake diagnosis of “chronic Lyme” in predatory and post-publication review journals (which accept and publish all manuscripts under the assumption that readers will review them later). One should not automatically trust all documents formatted as a scientific paper.
Don’t real journals publish fraud and nonsense too? Yes, but once the fraud is discovered, they can retract the paper (though far too many do not). So far, more than 30 articles on COVID-19 have been retracted. My paper and the one citing it have not, and never will. Silver lining: they can be used in science ethics classes to educate others about predatory publishing, and have inspired some researchers, such as Carthage College’s Adam Larson, to write Pokémon papers themselves.
How, then, to catch a predator, besides checking Beall’s List? First, assume all journals or conferences that email you unsolicited submission invitations are predatory, especially if they are outside your field, cover overly broad subjects, promise rapid review, or flatter you with compliments such as “eminent researcher.” Any journal with multiple email domains is predatory, as are absolutely all journals that list the worthless “Index Copernicus” number on their website. 
There are no shortcuts in science. If you want to be taken seriously as an academic, do not give predatory journals your business, especially as institutes wise up to the problem and stop accepting such articles on CVs or applications. Although, if any institute wants to grant me an honorary degree in Pokémon Studies for my eminence in the field, I would cheerfully accept.

Looming Change/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KOLDUNOV
I
n this topsy-turvy year, the world has been waylaid by a viral pandemic. But a larger and more intractable menace churns in the background, continuing to wreak havoc while humanity’s attention is diverted. Climate change remains arguably the most pressing threat we face as a species. And despite signs of hope earlier this year as lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic grounded airplanes, shuttered businesses, and garaged cars, the problem is not abating. Humanity must be able to fight disease while simultaneously keeping our sights trained on the persistent and snowballing effects of global warming. If we are not up to this task, the hell of 2020 will pale in comparison to the challenges we’ll face.
The first few months of the pandemic provided a glimpse of what a planet given respite from the relentless pressure of modern human inhabitance might look like. In April, people in Punjab, India, snapped photos of the Himalayas, more than 100 miles away, a sight usually obscured by smoggy skies. The International Energy Agency published a report that same month that the globe was on track to reduce CO2 emissions by 8 percent compared to 2019 levels—an unprecedented drop. 
All this sounded like a rare spot of good news in an otherwise disconcerting year. But alas, the sense that nature might be able to quickly heal over the scars of human activity was short-lived. As economies reopened, we took back to our petroleum-fueled modes of transportation, and fossil fuel–powered factories revved back up to continue their belching of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. By mid-May, levels of several air pollutants in China, including ozone, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter, had rebounded to concentrations above levels recorded in April and May of last year, according to an analysis by the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. And globally, CO2 emissions have been creeping back up as the planet’s human inhabitants return to something close to business as usual. By early June, global emissions had rebounded to within 5 percent of mean 2019 levels, up from an average 17 percent reduction in early April, according to data published by the Integrated Carbon Observation System.

There have also been negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment. Pre-pandemic, humans were already dumping an unbelievable amount of plastic—8 million metric tons per year—into our oceans, the eventual destination for much of our waste. But with the uptick in the use of products such as disposable plastic packaging, bags, and cutlery as well as personal protective equipment, this year is set to outpace 2019’s outflow of plastic waste by 30 percent, according to a paper published in June in Environmental Science & Technology.
While a pandemic the size and scope of COVID-19 demands immediate attention, action on climate change and other environmental crises cannot be shelved. Wildfires in the western US and hurricanes in the South remind us that even though we’re busy trying to address a pressing public health emergency, global warming isn’t put on pause. This persistent concern should inform how we strategically emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and enter a world where we live with the chronic problem of SARS-CoV-2 and likely future epidemics. “Any economic recovery packages designed to help economies fully rebound need to focus on zero-carbon climate resilient investments that address unemployment but avoid locking us into a new high-carbon future,” Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, told The Guardian in June. 
I was heartened to see that, in both the US presidential debate and the US vice presidential debate that have been held as of this writing, climate change questions were posed to the candidates, something that did not occur in the debates running up to the 2016 US election. After the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, humanity must learn to navigate a world changed by the ravages of a novel virus at the same time that we address not-so-novel problems with how Homo sapiens affects our planet and the organisms we share it with.

Trials Unlikely to Show if COVID-19 Vaccine Prevents Severe Cases/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
GEBER86
N
early 50 vaccines to protect against COVID-19 are speeding through clinical trials at an unprecedented pace. These studies are designed to test the vaccines’ safety and efficacy, but a review published in The Lancet earlier this week (October 27) outlines the challenges in determining whether a vaccine candidate really is efficacious. 
The authors of the review note that there are many definitions of efficacious—reducing the likelihood of developing severe symptoms is one, for instance, reducing the number of deaths is another. Presently, the ongoing clinical trials are mainly designed to determine if recipients have a reduced risk of a coronavirus infection, but knowing whether a vaccine can prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 or dying is a long way off. Vaccine developers have not produced evidence of such a benefit yet, rather, a number of them have reported evidence of an immune response in recipients, data that do not necessarily mean the vaccine will prevent infection, the authors write. 
The Scientist spoke with University of Oxford infectious disease specialist and coauthor Susanne Hodgson, who’s working on the UK clinical trials of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, about the timeline for generating evidence of vaccines’ effect on morbidity and mortality rates.
The Scientist: All eyes are currently on the vaccines undergoing clinical trials. What kind of evidence does a clinical trial show and not show?
Susanne Hodgson: COVID vaccines could work in a number of ways, for example, it could prevent you getting infected in the first place, it could reduce the likelihood of you developing severe disease, reduce the likelihood of you transmitting infection to other people, or do a combination of all three of those. And the hope is in Phase 3 clinical trials that we would start to get some data to tell us if the candidate COVID vaccine is actually able to do any of those three.
At the moment, unfortunately, because transmission rates are quite high, vaccine developers seem to be quite confident that we should get a measure of whether a COVID vaccine can prevent infection. However, because death and severe disease from COVID are a relatively rare consequence of infection, it’s unlikely that our clinical trials that are ongoing will be statistically powered to provide data to answer, ‘Do these vaccines prevent severe disease?’ 
Susanne Hodgson, University of Oxford
HANNAH VEALE
TS: Why is that an important distinction? 
SH: One of the reasons we wrote the article is because people often ask me, ‘Will this vaccine work?’ That seems such a simple question, and it’s so complex. There are so many caveats to answer: What do we mean when we say a vaccine ‘works?’ Does it mean it prevents diseases and infection, or does it mean to prevent transmission? And I think the most important vaccine that we need is one that prevents severe disease and death because that is what causes the most burden in our hospitals and of course loss of life. That’s what we’re all aiming for. 
That’s not to say that [the clinical trials] are not going to give us very important information—the safety data and an indication about whether they prevent infection, which of course are very important. But what’s most likely is that a vaccine will be deployed, given to a very large population on the basis of the clinical trial data, and only then, when a large number of people have had the vaccine, will we actually know if the vaccine prevents severe disease and or death. 
TS: Will these vaccines need to be monitored after approval, and why?
SH: There were already very clear protocols in place and infrastructure to monitor vaccines which are deployed and licensed in population. A COVID vaccine would be no different to existing vaccines and in terms of its monitoring post licensure. There would be ongoing, active monitoring of safety and side effects in COVID vaccines, so that if there were relatively rare side effects seen with the vaccine that only happened in one in many thousands of people we would still be able to get that information. 
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Researchers Mindful of Immune Enhancement”
Post-licensure authorities will be very keen to look for any evidence of vaccine-associated enhancement of COVID. This is individuals who’ve received a vaccine and then develop an immune response against COVID, who, when they then encounter COVID in the community, actually have a worse disease because of the vaccine-induced immune response. The reason this is a concern is some animal studies of vaccines that have been developed for other coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS have demonstrated this phenomenon. Fortunately, in the animal studies of COVID vaccines to date, this phenomenon hasn’t been seen, and there’s no suggestion yet to date that I’m aware of that this has been seen in humans in relation to COVID vaccines. But of course, that’s a reason why there will be ongoing intense monitoring of safety post-deployment of a COVID vaccine.
TS: What makes it so challenging to determine if a vaccine is efficacious?
SH: First, when you just decide whether a vaccine works enough, you need to decide what the definition of a vaccine working is. As I mentioned before, a vaccine could reduce infection rates, transmission rates, or disease, and so for each of those outcomes you need to be very careful and understand how you will measure those outcomes. A lot of those outcomes rely on laboratory assays, for example, the real-time qPCR assay, which tests for the presence of antigen and confirms COVID testing. As I’m sure a lot of people are familiar, this test is imperfect. . . . Other people have suggested perhaps using antibody levels as a way of telling if somebody has become infected or not, but as we’ve seen in a lot of the papers that are coming out, not everybody develops antibody levels, and if you do they don’t stay elevated for a long time. And, of course, the many vaccines are aiming to induce antibodies, so you need to be able to distinguish vaccine-induced antibodies from those which are induced by infections specifically. 
Clinical trials that are assessing efficacy take volunteers, typically will give half a COVID vaccine and half a placebo vaccine or a comparator, vaccinate them all, and then follow them up in the community, and you’re reliant on individuals in the trial meeting COVID in the community, becoming infected, and then you compare the infection rates in your test vaccine group compared to your placebo group. If your vaccine is working, you would hope that statistically more people get COVID in your comparator group compared to your vaccine group. Of course, that relies on ongoing transmission in the community, which is at odds with all the public health interventions that we’re trying to adhere, so paradoxically the better we are at controlling COVID transmission in the community, the longer it takes for us to get an efficacy read-out in terms of infection from these clinical trials. 
TS: Given your background in vaccines, what gives you hope about the vaccine development process, looking forward to next year?
SH: It’s the speed at which people are moving. People [are] also publishing extremely quickly their data and sharing that, which is really encouraging. I think all ethical bodies, regulatory bodies, and, internationally, people are very supportive of the vaccine development program for COVID. 
Having worked on malaria vaccines for more than a decade now, I am optimistic with regards for a COVID vaccine because of all the things I’ve just mentioned. But I’m also a bit sanguine because we’ve seen so many malaria candidates that look promising in pre-clinical studies and in Phase 1 studies—you generate immune responses—but when it actually comes to the challenge study, which we use in malaria studies, it’s disappointing and you have to go right back again. I’m hopeful and of course the large number of candidates you have the more likely you are to get some that will work, but I think we need to just be realistic that this isn’t necessarily a matter of just, “One more month, one more month,” that seems to be presented in the media.
I just hope that the public should have faith in the vaccine development community—they’re a formidable professional group who have very stringent regulations that they’re adhering to and they’re prioritizing safety. This is not about headlines and just getting a vaccine to meet a headline or a political deadline. This is an international group working very hard and doing what they’ve been doing for many years, for many other pathogens, to get us a safe, efficacious vaccine as soon as we can. That can’t be rushed, unfortunately—people are moving as quick as they can. This is unprecedented pace of development, but it will only be ready when it’s safe and it actually works.

Alterations in Immune Genes Make Bats Great Viral Hosts/-/ABOVE: Cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea)

ats act as reservoirs for lots of viruses—including coronaviruses such as those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and possibly COVID-19—but they don’t often get sick themselves. How they avoid viral illness has been an open question. Researchers reported in PNAS yesterday (October 26) that various species of bats have slightly different ways of suppressing inflammation, all centered on changes in genes responsible for triggering innate immune responses.
The authors demonstrate a number of the mechanisms in bats that seem to support their capacity to tolerate viruses that make other mammals really sick, says Cara Brook, a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the work. “This follows a series of other publications that really highlight a dampened inflammatory response in bats that suggests that they are uniquely resistant and resilient to the consequences of immunopathology . . . and don’t experience the kind of autoimmune disease that we often incur against ourselves.”
In a study published in 2013, Linfa Wang, an immunologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, and colleagues compared the genomes of two bat species: the fruit bat (Pteropus alecto) and insectivorous bat (Myotis davidii). They found that both species had lost a gene called AIM2, which in other mammals encodes a protein that senses pathogenic DNA and triggers inflammasomes, protein complexes that activate proinflammatory signals that in turn promote the maturation of cytokines, small signaling proteins that can be released by immune cells and regulate inflammation and immunity.
What’s nice about this paper is that it points to the fact that different species have evolved different mechanisms for achieving the same ends.

In the current study, Wang’s group followed up on AIM2 to figure out what affect its loss has on cellular responses to pathogenic DNA. They compared macrophages, the innate immune system’s primary effector cells, from mice and fruit bats. The mouse cells, which have a functional gene, make the aggregates of AIM2 and its protein binding partner, which together trigger the inflammasome pathway when cells are exposed to double-stranded DNA. None of this occurred in the fruit bat cells. When the researchers added in a copy of the human version of AIM2 to fruit bat kidney cells aggregates still formed, but did not activate other inflammasome-related genes, including those that encode the effector enzyme caspase-1, which activates the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β.
“We hypothesized that further downstream activation of the inflammasome pathway may be affected in bats and decided to investigate these signaling components in an effort to detect any alteration in their function,” Wang writes in an email to The Scientist. 
The researchers determined that the faulty caspase-1 response was due to bat-specific mutations in two sites within the fragment of the enzyme that must be cleaved in order for it to be activated. When they engineered the equivalent human amino acids back into the coding sequence, the bat enzyme worked just as the human protein does. The reverse experiment confirmed these mutations were responsible for the impaired enzyme function. Introducing both bat-specific mutations into the gene for the human protein resulted in a loss of function of human caspase-1.

In contrast, they found, the Myotis genus of bats has functional caspase-1, but these animals’ genomes instead contain mutations in IL-1β that prevent the cytokine’s cleavage and subsequent for cellular secretion. A third species, the cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea) had diminished, though not completely suppressed, function of both caspase-1 and IL-1β, resulting from a handful of mutations.
When people “find something about one species of bats, they assume that every bat species does the same thing, and that’s not true,” says Vikram Misra, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan who did not participate in the study “What’s nice about this paper is that it points to the fact that different species have evolved different mechanisms for achieving the same ends.”
“It’s very small changes in specific amino acids, where you have one change . . . that can completely change the function of a protein,” Karen Mossman, a virologist at McMaster University who did not participate in the work, tells The Scientist. In the future, it will be “interesting to really understand how all of these subtle changes in these proteins work collectively to give the bats their immune system,” she adds. “It’s so similar to the human immune system; the components of the pathways are very similar. And yet, there’re these vast, vast changes and differences in how they respond, say, to a viral infection.”
Although many species of bats don’t seem to get sick from viruses, inflammation in bats does exist, such as when they’re exposed to fungal diseases, Misra says. “Even though inflammation because of the viral infection is dampened, there’ve got to be other pathways that bring out inflammation. That’s something that I think we haven’t, as a group of bat researchers, addressed completely at this point.”

T
he antibody treatment bamlanivimab, or LY-CoV555, appears to be ineffective in treating severe cases of COVID-19, the drugmaker Eli Lilly announced yesterday (October 26). As a result, a clinical trial testing the drug in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has ended, but studies examining its use in early and mild-to-moderate coronavirus infections will continue. 
See “First Antibody Trial Launched in COVID-19 Patients”
Ending the clinical trial in hospitalized patients came in response to data showing the drug “is unlikely to help [the patients] recover from this advanced stage of their disease,” according to the company’s statement. That decision “tells us they stopped the trial due to futility, as suspected,” Eric Topol, a clinical trial expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, tells The New York Times. The result also “suggests that the timing of monoclonal antibody administration—early—will be important,” he notes.
The data on the drug support that idea, as results from other clinical trials of bamlanivimab indicate that it might block replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in human cells. The drug can also cut the rate of hospitalizations and emergency room visits in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms compared with patients not receiving the treatment.
See “Antibody-Based Drug May Reduce COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Study”
Based on those other clinical trial results, Eli Lilly has asked the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization to treat less severe cases of COVID-19, the Associated Press reports.
More SARS-CoV-2 Reinfections Reported, But Still a Rare Event/-/ABOVE: SARS-COV-2 virus particles (yellow) infect a cell (blue)

t least 285 individuals in Mexico appear to have contracted the novel coronavirus twice, according to a preprint posted October 18 on medRxiv. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, is the largest to date to assess the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. It fuels an ongoing discussion among researchers about how long immunity to the virus lasts after an initial infection and how that length of immunity may affect the way vaccines against the virus are administered in the future.
“If we find that our immunity is poor, or nonexistent . . . this will be a big problem for vaccination policies,” study coauthor Carlos Hernandez-Suarez, a researcher at Universidad de Colima in San Sebastian, Mexico, tells The Scientist, adding that no conclusions can be made from the current data about the strength of survivors’ immunity or the protection offered by future vaccines. In his team’s analysis of hospital records of 100,432 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March and July 2020, only 285 (0.26 percent) presented signs that they’d contracted the virus twice. 
Hernandez-Suarez and colleagues set out to pinpoint the frequency of reinfections among the patients. They’d read several studies pointing to possible reinfections and also an August letter to the editor in the Journal of Infection by Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester in the UK, and colleagues laying out criteria for defining reinfection. The definition included an initial PCR-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, then clinical recovery and a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive test at least 28 days after the initial positive test. The suspected second infections need to be at least 28 days after the initial ones because evidence suggests it takes that long for viral shedding to begin to taper off and because certain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies start to drop off at that point, according to another study posted to medRxiv in July.
Following that definition, Hernandez-Suarez and colleagues dug into the hospital records and identified the 285 patients obtaining medical care after a second positive PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the majority of patients, “we didn’t have the test in between,” the negative test, Hernandez-Suarez notes. 
The team did have that test for 14 individuals, and it was negative, but for the rest, the patients’ second positive test came 28 days or more after the first, in some cases 60 or 70 days later, he explains. “The average was 66 days, with no complications, no problems, and then they went to the hospital again with [respiratory] problems.” To the team, that was an indication of a second infection, rather than a prolonged initial illness.
It’s hard to know without more data, such as negative tests in between positive ones, if the cases are in fact reinfections or long-lasting illnesses from a single infection, says Tang, who was not involved in the work. Still, the latest results align with other studies and case reports that indicate reinfection is rare.
“This reinfection thing is not new. It’s not unusual, not dramatic, or scary, or whatever you want to call it. It’s very normal,” Tang tells The Scientist, noting that other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause repeated reinfections. Whether it happens frequently with SARS-CoV-2, though, he says, is not yet clear.
The genetic evidence for reinfection
The first indications that reinfection could occur came from case reports out of Hong Kong and Europe, and then Nevada. What distinguished some of these cases as clear reinfections rather than lingering initial infections is that the genomes of the viruses causing the first and second infections weren’t identical.
“You can really only prove reinfection” if the viral variants from the first and second positive swabs are different, notes Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York, “because it’s very unlikely that you would be infected with the exact same variants a second time.” 
SARS-CoV-2 has an RNA genome, which has a higher mutation rate than a DNA viral genome. The mutation rate is so fast, in fact, that “even within an individual host who’s infected, you may have multiple variants that are just emerging as the virus replicates itself and makes mistakes,” she explains. The genetic changes that SARS-CoV-2 has so far accumulated seem to be functionally inconsequential, and “in the population, when you think about how many millions of different coronavirus cases there are, different variants have emerged . . . [so] it’s very unlikely that you would get the exact same one.”
A study posted September 28 to medRxiv confirms four reinfections in Qatar using genetic sequencing data that found distinct viral variants between the first and second infections. These are among 133,266 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases that Roberto Bertollini, a doctor with the Ministry of Public Health in Doha, and colleagues analyzed. It’s possible there were more reinfections, as the authors note that 243 individuals had positive PCR tests at least 45 days apart, but only 12 patients had sufficient viral genome data at both time points. Two of the cases had identical viral genomes on the first and second positive test, suggesting a lingering infection that never cleared in the weeks between the two positive tests, and the six others didn’t have enough genetic changes to make a firm conclusion about reinfection.
Regardless, Bertollini and his colleagues conclude in their report that “the risk for documented reinfection was very rare at about 1-2 reinfections per 10,000 infected persons.” The researchers further note that the “findings suggest that most infected persons do develop immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least [a] few months, and that reinfections (if they occur) are well tolerated and no more symptomatic than primary infections.”
Insights into immunity from reinfection cases
Contracting the virus twice within the span of a few months may be more common than the data collected so far suggest. That’s if SARS-CoV-2 acts anything like seasonal coronaviruses, according to a paper published September 14. In that study, Arthur Edridge of the University of Amsterdam and colleagues analyzed stored blood samples of 10 healthy individuals that were taken, on average, every few months for the past 35 years. The team tested the samples for an increase in antibodies to a specific region of the structural capsid protein of each seasonal coronavirus. 
Antibody levels spiked and dropped at regular intervals, showing “reinfections with all four seasonal coronaviruses are common and frequently occur after about a year,” Edridge writes in an email to The Scientist. Reinfection is therefore a “common human coronavirus feature,” he explains, and SARS-CoV-2 would most likely be no exception.
See “Does the Common Cold Protect You from COVID-19?”
Rasmussen, who was not involved with any of the studies, says that reinfection is certainly possible, but she’s less convinced that SARS-CoV-2 will act like other coronaviruses that cause colds. Those other coronavirus reinfections may happen because those viruses only cause a mild infection and don’t elicit a strong immune response with lots of long-lasting antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 could be very different, she says.
That immune durability should really be the focus of reinfection studies, Tang explains. Researchers need to look at the longevity of antibodies after infection or vaccination, because if they start to wane, then there may be a need for vaccine boosters several months after the initial shot is given. The case reports and preliminary studies contribute to that overall picture of understanding SARS-CoV-2 immunity and its implication for vaccination, he explains, “but there’s a long way to go.”
SARS-CoV-2 Disables Key Components of Human Cells’ Defense System/-/ABOVE: A mammalian cell infected with SARS-CoV-2, showing the formation of compartments where viral RNA is replicated (top left) and individual virions exiting the cell (right)

iral proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 disrupt critical components of human cells’ molecular machinery and disable responses to infection, according to a study published October 8 in Cell. Researchers in the US describe how specific viral proteins bind to human RNAs involved in RNA splicing, protein translation, and protein trafficking, and in doing so suppress the host cell’s coordination of a key antiviral defense known as the type I interferon response.
The study offers a possible mechanistic explanation for the blunted immune responses observed in some COVID-19 patients, says Benjamin Terrier, an immunologist at Cochin Hospital in Paris who was not involved in the work. The researchers “are clearly demonstrating how the virus is able to impair the production of proteins involved in [this defense].”
See “The Immune Hallmarks of Severe COVID-19”
In the type I interferon response, a cell that has detected foreign genetic material in its cytoplasm launches the production and secretion of interferons—signaling proteins that go on to trigger the expression of hundreds of antiviral genes. 
Studies by Terrier and others have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 often show a huge reduction in interferon production, suggesting that the virus’s success might in some cases be linked to an ability to disrupt this cellular defense. 
See “Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV”
Caltech biologist Mitchell Guttman, along with Dev Majumdar of the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine and colleagues, discovered just how SARS-CoV-2 might be doing this while studying interactions between the virus’s 27 known proteins and human RNA in vitro. 
The researchers had inserted the genes for each of SARS-CoV-2’s proteins into different sets of human cells, such that each cell would produce just one viral protein. Then, the team had extracted those proteins along with whatever RNAs they’d bound to and studied the interactions between the molecules.
We want to understand how the virus can disrupt host cell machinery and yet be able to engage ribosomes, be able to engage the trafficking machinery—all these things that have been shut off.
—Dev Majumdar, University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine
The researchers found that 10 of the virus’s proteins were bound to RNAs involved in critical cell processes such as RNA splicing, protein translation, and protein transport. To the team’s surprise, Guttman says, as many as four proteins bound specifically to structural noncoding RNAs that make up the cell machinery in charge of coordinating those processes. 
The viral protein NSP16, for example, bound to a host RNA sequence in the spliceosome in a way that rendered the complex unable to recognize RNA transcripts, let alone splice them properly. NSP1 bound to the ribosome in a position that made it impossible for mRNAs to enter—essentially “putting a cork” in the protein-translating structure, Guttman says. And NSP8 and NSP9 bound to and interfered with the signal recognition particle, a structure that helps transport newly translated proteins around the cell.
Based on these results, the team predicted that infection with SARS-CoV-2 would drastically reduce splicing, translation, and protein transport in human cells and would consequently suppress the interferon response, which relies on boosting these three processes. Indeed, lung epithelial cells infected with the virus showed just that, the researchers report in their paper.
See “SARS-CoV-2 Protein Hampers Innate Immune Reaction In Vitro”
Christian Münch, a cell biologist at Goethe University Frankfurt who was not involved in the work, praises the study’s comprehensive description of the basic biological mechanisms underlying these effects. “This is one of these nice examples where very nice methods were [applied to] this new virus to look at what actually happens in the cell after infection,” he says. 
As the researchers note in their paper, Münch adds, the study did not rule out a role for other pathways in helping SARS-CoV-2 evade host defenses or examine potential interactions among the viral proteins themselves. He adds that future work could look more into how the effects develop over time from infection.
Guttman says the team is interested in possible therapeutic implications of the study’s results. One route could be to target viral proteins such as NSP1 with drugs that stop them interacting with cellular apparatus. 
The researchers are also investigating how the virus—which is dependent on the host to get its own RNA translated and its proteins transported—manages to replicate itself in such a severely compromised cell, says Majumdar.
“We want to understand how the virus can disrupt host cell machinery and yet be able to engage ribosomes, be able to engage the trafficking machinery—all these things that have been shut off,” Majumdar explains. “What are the signals being presented by the viral mRNAs to basically give it a ticket to ride on all of those machines?”
Preliminary data indicate that distinctive loops in the structure of SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs could be acting as those signals, Majumdar says. Hitting the loops with small-molecule drugs might help block viral activity inside infected cells, he adds.
Terrier notes that most therapeutic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 focus on stopping the virus getting into cells, rather than dampening viral activity within already infected cells. “Since SARS-CoV-2 is really acute, I think the most important [thing] to do is to block the entry of the virus,” he says. “If you are really efficient at that, you don’t need to be as efficient” in targeting intracellular responses.
But the team’s data offer crucial mechanistic information to inform future research on this and closely related viruses such as SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), he adds. “Trying to [understand] how the virus could determine the severity of the disease, the fact that it could paralyze the immune system—clearly that’s very important.”

Decoy Cells Trick SARS-CoV-2, Reduce Cytokines In Vitro/-/ABOVE: This illustration shows SARS-CoV-2 (right) binding to a genetically engineered vesicle (left) that has many ACE2 receptors, which the virus uses to gain entry into human cells.
LANG RAO & XIAOYUAN CHEN, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
S
cientists have summoned every trick in the book to develop a COVID-19 treatment over the last few months, from stem cells and synthetic antibodies to common over-the-counter medications and tried-and-true steroids. Some have even attempted to lure SARS-CoV-2 away from human cells by using molecular decoys. But few have tried to distract the novel coronavirus with fake human cells. Scientists reported in PNAS last week (October 6) that genetically engineered cells can bind and neutralize the coronavirus in vitro. They envision that such cellular decoys could be deployed to combat infections.
“It’s a very elegant study,” says Karolinska Institute molecular toxicologist Bengt Fadeel, who was not involved in this study. “Provided that you know the receptor of a given virus, you could, in principle, adopt this approach to intercept any virus.”
Xiaoyuan Chen, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pivoted from developing nanotechnology to diagnose and treat cancers to study SARS-CoV-2 when the virus began spreading around the world early this year. He had seen previous reports of using decoy receptors to trick pathogens such as HIV and was curious if the emerging technique might work against SARS-CoV-2.
To find out, Chen and his collaborators at Wuhan University fused membranes from human monocytic THP-1 cells, a cell line derived from leukemia, with membranes from human embryonic kidney cells that overproduce the ACE2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 grabs hold of to infiltrate cells. Chen says they hoped that, if the hybrid vesicles were injected in vivo, the virus would ignore unmodified human cells and instead home in on the decoys. Once attached to the engineered cells’ ACE2, the virus would be absorbed and neutralized, according to Chen.
By embedding monocytic membranes, which have cytokine receptors, into the engineered vesicles, the decoys can bind with inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, preventing them from building up and causing cytokine storms, overreactive immune responses thought to contribute to more severe COVID-19.
The idea of a decoy to thwart SARS-CoV-2 infection is not a new one. One team of scientists created a decoy using engineered, free-floating ACE2 receptors that bind especially well with the virus. Their decoys, which the developers propose can “significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections,” are now in a Phase 2 clinical trial run by Apeiron Biologics. In a July preprint, pharmacologist Gaurav Sahay of Oregon State University described a method that delivers engineered mRNA that codes for ACE2 to the liver of mice using lipid nanoparticles, causing ACE2 decoys to be translated and secreted into the blood. He found that the method successfully led to an increase of ACE2 decoys in vivo and they inhibited a modified, nonpathogenic version of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Chen’s new spin on the concept is to couple the decoys with cytokine receptors. “The combination of [ACE2 and cytokine receptors in] the vesicle structure is something new,” says Sahay, who was not involved in Chen’s study. “It’s a very exciting development.”  
Researchers tested the nanodecoys by incubating both SARS-CoV, responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, and SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, in human and monkey cells, and found that the decoys significantly inhibited viral infection, regardless of cell or virus type.
To test whether the decoys could work outside a petri dish, researchers induced acute lung inflammation in mice by having them inhale lipopolysaccharide, an irritant. Four hours later, the mice inhaled the nanodecoys, and after eight hours, the researchers collected fluid from the mice’s lungs. They found that the decoys successfully mopped up cytokines compared to mice that did not receive decoys.
“This study is rather straightforward,” says Chen. “It’s surprising that such a simple approach is able to neutralize the virus, at least at the cellular level, and in vivo neutralize cytokines within hours. For COVID-19, a rapid response is essential, and these nanodecoys do just that.”
While these results suggest that these decoys can neutralize cytokines in mice’s lungs, their ability to block a SARS-CoV-2 infection was not tested in mice. Chen cited a shortage of the transgenic mice bearing human ACE2 that would be needed to conduct such experiments.
Mice that received the nanodecoys showed no adverse reaction to the treatment, which is encouraging, says Fadeel, but he says he wonders if that would hold true in humans as well, particularly because the engineered cells use material from human cancer cells. “I would be cautious about administering small bits of cancer cells, especially into the lungs,” he says.
Sahay also notes that cell membranes in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines produce ACE2 for a reason—it cleaves angiotensin, a protein that raises blood pressure. He questions if the decoys might impair the body’s ability to regulate blood pressure, as angiotensin may bind to the decoys.
Neither Chen nor his colleagues at Wuhan University currently have plans to test the decoys in humans, but he filed a patent for their design through the NIH.  “It’s a very simple approach—almost too simple,” says Chen. “That’s the beauty of this study.”

US Tops List of COVID-19 and All-Cause Death Rates Since May/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
MAMMUTH
T
he COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the US, with more than 216,000 confirmed deaths attributed to the disease and much of the population still vulnerable to the virus. A new report in JAMA released this week (October 12) compares how 19 countries that have employed different virus response strategies have fared since early May, finding that the US has the highest COVID-19 death rate.
“It’s shocking. It’s horrible,” Ezekiel Emanuel, a former White House health adviser who chairs the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania and a coauthor of the report, tells NPR. “The United States really has done remarkably badly compared to other countries. I mean, remarkably badly.”
Emanuel and his Harvard University colleague looked at COVID-19 death rates through mid-September in 19 countries that have a population greater than 5 million and a gross domestic product of at least $25,000 per capita. They also tabulated the rates of death from any cause, which accounts for those that may have been due to the coronavirus but were never confirmed, for 14 countries with available data through July 25. 
The report showed that the US had more deaths per 100,000 people than other high-mortality countries such as Italy and Sweden, and the most deaths per capita from any cause since May among all 14 countries.
Adjusting for population, US overall deaths this year are more than 85 percent higher than Germany and Canada and more than 29 percent higher than Sweden, “which ignored everything for so long,” Emanuel tells NPR. Sweden took an unconventional approach to the virus and imposed few restrictions and no lockdown. “We have 29% more mortality than we should have if we’d followed Sweden’s path and Sweden virtually did nothing,” Emanuel says.
The authors also concluded that if the US COVID-19 death rate after May 10 were similar to that of Italy’s, the US would have had 91,604 fewer deaths.
“Italy didn’t have anything special or different in terms of treatment, vaccines, diagnostics compared to the United States,” Emanuel tells CNBC. “What they had is better implementation of the public health measures, and that actually could have saved tens of thousands of lives in the United States.”
Another study published in JAMA October 12 found that the overall US death rate rose 20 percent in the time period from March to August compared to expected deaths, with 67 percent of the excess deaths arising from the virus.
Johnson & Johnson Pauses COVID-19 Vaccine Trials/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GEBER86
Update (October 27): After the company did not find a cause for the participant’ s illness, Johnson & Johnson announced on October 23 that it is seeking to resume the clinical trial, according to a statement.
J
ohnson & Johnson’s Janssen subsidiary, one of several companies in Phase 3 testing of vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, has temporarily suspended enrollment and dosing in all of its clinical trials after a patient experienced an adverse reaction during its Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial.
The incident was first reported on Monday (October 12) by STAT after reporters received a copy of a document sent to outside researchers running the study’s individual trials. The document states that a “pausing rule” had been met to justify the suspension and that the online system used to enroll patients was closed.
“We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant,” the company says in a statement. The case is currently being reviewed by an independent safety board, and no details have been shared about the patient or the nature of the illness that prompted the pause.
Pauses in late-stage clinical trials are not uncommon, nor is Johnson & Johnson the first company to temporarily suspend progress. In September, AstraZeneca paused all of its clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines following a case of transverse myelitis in a UK patient. While most trials have since resumed, the US-based study remains on hold pending a regulatory review, Reuters reports.
“It’s actually a good thing that these companies are pausing these trials when these things come up,” Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco, a trial location for both vaccine candidates, tells The New York Times. “We just need to let the sponsor and the safety board do their review and let us know their findings.”
See "COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners"
Phase 3 trials assess the efficacy of a possible vaccine and attempt to identify even relatively rare side effects by testing large amounts of people. The Johnson & Johnson ENSEMBLE trial had planned to enroll as many as 60,000 participants in several countries, STAT reports, making it one of the world’s largest efforts to test a COVID-19 vaccine.
Like the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine relies on an experimental method, based on an adenovirus vector, that has yet to lead to any approved immunizations, although it was used previously in studies to prevent infections of influenza and Ebola. Scientists engineered the virus to smuggle the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into human cells. Once inside, the gene expresses the protein, which then primes immune cells to recognize SARS-CoV-2.
It is unknown, even by the researchers, whether the participant who has fallen ill received the vaccine or a placebo. The symptoms don’t “mean that the adverse event is related to the vaccine, but it needs to be investigated thoroughly,” Luciana Borio, a public health administrator who has worked under both President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama, tells the Times. 
Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, tells CNN the pause shows that the safeguards are working as they should. “We want the vaccine to be safe and we’ve got to let the process play out,” Jha says. “To me, it’s reassuring that companies are acting responsibly and pausing when they need to.”
Correction (October 13): We mistakenly referred to these vaccines as treating SARS-CoV-2, rather than preventing illness. The Scientist regrets these errors.
Amid Pandemic, Scientists Lean on Credentials in Political Races/-/ABOVE: DR. CAMERON WEBB FOR CONGRESS
A
lthough Cameron Webb decided to run for political office long before the pandemic started, his campaign appears to be made for times like these. The 37-year-old physician announced his bid to represent Virginia’s 5th congressional district last August, and he says the main thing on his mind then was repairing the country’s broken healthcare system. While seeing patients with diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease as an internist at the University of Virginia’s Department of Medicine, he witnessed the structural problems that contributed to his patients’ conditions, factors such as food insecurity, income inequality, and poor access to healthcare.
“I see those systems, those policies, failing people and manifesting in poor health outcomes, and that makes me want to address the policies rather than just keep treating sick patients,” Webb tells The Scientist. He adds that he was also motivated by mounting threats to the Affordable Care Act by President Donald Trump’s administration. Webb had helped work on the implementation of Obamacare as a White House Fellow under President Barack Obama. (He was also a Fellow under Trump.)
In June of this year, amid a raging pandemic and nationwide protests over racial justice in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by police, Webb won the Democratic nomination after receiving two-thirds of the vote in a crowded primary. While he continues to treat COVID-19 patients in the clinic, Webb is now running in a close race against Republican nominee Bob Good to win over the large district, which voted for Trump in 2016 with 58 percent of the votes, after twice voting for Obama. Good had a long career in finance before taking a position as an athletic director at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, a position he left to pursue politics. If Webb wins on November 3, he’ll become the first Black physician in Congress.
The attacks on science didn’t start with the Trump administration, but they turned what felt like an attack on science to an all-out war on reality.
—Shaughnessy Naughton, 314 Action
More than 30 candidates with science-related backgrounds—engineers, chemists, physicians, and astronauts—have landed on the ballot for House and Senate races, of which most are seeking reelection for seats they already hold. And an all-time high of more than 170 candidates are running in state and local races across the country. Most Democrats are supported by 314 Action, a nonprofit political action committee created in 2016 to boost the representation of fact- and science-driven decision-makers in Washington and beyond. 314 Action does not endorse Republican candidates for congressional races due to what the organization perceives as a conflict between the party’s policy positions and the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and other issues, although Republican candidates are able to take part in 314 Action’s campaign preparation training.
Shaughnessy Naughton, the founder and president of the organization, says she believes that candidates’ scientific backgrounds give them an advantage this year in particular, as the pandemic has underscored the importance of following scientific principles as well as the potential consequences of ignoring expertise.
Many doctors “got into the race because of the healthcare issues, but then perhaps have earned themselves a little bit more focus and credibility because of everything that’s happened since,” notes Jacob Rubashkin, a reporter and analyst at Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of US elections. That said, “it’s hard to say what will or will not sway voters.”
Track the candidates with STEM backgrounds running for federal seats
While the overall numbers of scientists in the House and Senate remain small, 2018 saw an influx of lawmakers with STEM backgrounds. Of 20 candidates who ran for House seats that year—most of them Democrats supported by 314 Action—around half won their races. Two out of three Senate candidates won, according to a list compiled by The Scientist. Although it’s unclear if they succeeded because of their science backgrounds, Rubashkin notes, many of them did leverage their experiences to their advantage. For instance, Congresswoman Lauren Underwood (D-IL), who is now representing Illinois’s 14th district, “was able to parlay her credibility as a nurse, as a public health expert, into trust from voters at a time when healthcare was the number one thing on their minds . . . and because of that, she was able to turn this Republican district blue,” Rubashkin says.
In Congress, such representatives have contributed to diversifying a political body that is largely dominated by lawyers and introduced legislation tackling medicine and environmental issues, although many of those bills have stalled in the Senate, The Scientist reported last year.
This year, 314 Action has endorsed 19 House candidates—14 of them, including Underwood, are running for reelection—and five who are targeting Senate seats, four of whom are newcomers. Among them is retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who aims to fill in the remainder of the term for the late Senator John McCain (R-AZ). Academic researchers are also on the ballot, including the former chair of Stony Brook University’s chemistry department, Nancy Goroff, who is challenging Republican incumbent Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a military veteran and lawyer, in a close race for a seat representing New York’s 1st Congressional district. Her campaign emphasizes her reliance on facts and data and stresses the importance of taking a fact-based approach in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Her campaign even features pictures of her in a lab coat examining brightly colored fluids. If she’s successful she’d become the first woman with a science PhD in Congress.
Naughton says that earlier in the year, candidates with STEM backgrounds competing for federal seats fared better in their primaries than in 2018. Naughton attributes this success largely to the pandemic, which has placed those with science backgrounds as assets and trusted voices in their communities, she says.
Rubashkin notes that Goroff’s campaign strategy of leaning on her identity as a scientist to appeal to voters is “a big part of why she won her contested primary, [albeit] very narrowly.” Webb, who also has a law degree, has raised his profile by the strength of his medical background, Rubashkin adds. But Webb’s success was also thanks to support from African American voters, who make up one-fifth of the district’s population. “I think that’s going to be a key ingredient for November,” Webb told the Associated Press after his primary victory in June.
Continued momentum from 2018, now possibly fueled by the pandemic
Although the number of candidates in the running for federal seats hasn’t changed much since 2018, there’s been a substantial increase in candidates with STEM backgrounds running for state legislative positions. Across the country, 314 Action counts 174, a more than sevenfold increase from the number of candidates the organization endorsed in 2018.
Naughton says the organization has also seen a surge in funding since the midterms: for that election cycle, the organization raised some $5.2 million to support its candidates, a figure that has grown to some $18 million for this year’s elections. Naughton says she sees this uptick in support for 314 Action as a reflection of a desire to counter an increasingly widespread antiscience sentiment in US politics over the past few years. “The attacks on science didn’t start with the Trump administration, but they turned what felt like an attack on science to an all-out war on reality,” Naughton says.
If you think about everything that has happened over the past seven months, it’s kind of insane when you break it down into its component parts.
—Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections
“I think something has happened in our politics that makes people question facts,” Webb adds. Data are often misconstrued to suit particular narratives not only when it comes to science-based issues such as climate change, but also on the state of the economy, he says. “I think the more we have credible and authentic leadership on issues, the more people are inclined to accept those facts as the foundation of a policy intervention.”
In an April online poll commissioned by 314 Action surveying 1,002 likely voters from across the country, 61 percent of respondents indicated that they think that US politicians lack the experience necessary to handle the pandemic. Furthermore, 88 percent agreed with the statement that Congress would benefit from more representatives with a science background. To Naughton, those results bode well for the success of candidates with STEM backgrounds on November 3. “I think that is what Americans are looking for in this election: someone who they can . . . base their conclusions and policies on the facts and evidence and to keep them safe.”
Webb says he thinks his experience in treating COVID-19 patients, while also meeting with business owners and seeing the economic toll, has given him a balanced perspective on the pandemic that he hopes will appeal to voters. “I have human faces and fears attached to my vision of what navigating this pandemic looks like,” he says, “and I think that that’s something that voters [want] to hear a really thoughtful approach [on].”
Rubashkin says he thinks it’s possible that the pandemic could influence the outcomes of the ongoing congressional races. But while COVID-19 is a key concern in voter’s minds, so are a host of other issues, and the country has become increasingly polarized over many of them. “If you think about everything that has happened over the past seven months, it’s kind of insane when you break it down into its component parts. Between the pandemic, the conversation over racial justice, unrest in the streets, impeachment, Supreme Court, the economy—there are a whole bunch of ingredients that are coming together here.”
Inside Elections projects that Democrats are likely to retain their majority in the House and may expand representation. For the Senate, it predicts a Democrat net gain of three to five seats, which would grant the party narrow control of the chamber. But with regard to individual races playing out in the states, “each of them with their own unique set of issues,” Rubashkin says—“it’s hard to know until votes are cast.”
Scientists’ Advice for Ways to Ward Off the Coronavirus/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ERHUI1979
N
ine months since the disease now known as COVID-19 first crept into the headlines, standard advice for avoiding it—such as wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, and washing hands well and often—has become familiar. But as winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, and with it an anticipated surge in cases, we sought out additional science-backed tactics to lower the chances of becoming infected, or of developing severe disease. The Scientist spoke with experts in virology, immunology, and medicine about the measures they’re taking themselves and recommending to others that may boost defenses against the novel coronavirus and other pathogens. None yet meet the gold standard for clinical evidence—a randomized controlled trial showing they reduce COVID-19 transmission or severity—but for each, there’s a scientific rationale for thinking they may provide some protection.
Get vaccinated 
JAMES GATHANY/CDC
As we anxiously await a proven vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, studies indicate that certain existing vaccines—namely, those made with live, attenuated pathogens—confer some degree of temporary protection against germs they weren’t designed to target. For example, a trial published last month in Cell found that 25 percent of elderly people randomized to receive the tuberculosis vaccine bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) developed any kind of infection over the following year, compared with 42 percent of those who got a placebo shot. The vaccine appeared to be most protective against viral respiratory infections. 
Trials are now underway to test whether BCG and two other live vaccines, oral polio and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), provide some protection against COVID-19. Robert Gallo, who directs the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and chairs the international scientific leadership board of the Global Virus Network, has advocated for testing oral polio in particular against the coronavirus. It’s cheap, easy to administer, and readily available, he says, adding that he expects other live vaccines would likewise provide bonus protections, including the intranasal flu vaccine, “which I’d love to take myself for the flu season.” He is unfortunately over the age limit—it’s only approved for people between 2 and 49 years old.
The conventional flu shot is not a live vaccine, but the protection any flu vaccine provides against influenza itself is particularly important this year, notes Rachel Roper, who studies SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and other viruses at Eastern Carolina University. You don’t want to get the flu and need medical attention at a time when the healthcare system may be overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, she writes in an email to The Scientist. “If you get flu and have to go to the doctor, you may be exposed to people who have COVID and catch it yourself!” 
Get some sunshine (or a supplement)
© ISTOCK.COM, NEWANNYART
Far from being only important for bone health, the hormone vitamin D “affects many, many, many systems and cells throughout the body,” including innate and adaptive immunity, says Carol Wagner, a neonatologist at the Medical University of South Carolina who studies the vitamin in clinical trials. “I, of course, have all my family members and friends taking vitamin D.” Wagner and others now have clinical trials underway to test whether supplements of vitamin D—which can also be obtained through sun exposure and some foods—reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or of developing severe COVID-19. In the meantime, some observational studies have pointed to an effect, such as an analysis published last month that compared 191,779 US patients’ SARS-CoV-2 test results with a vitamin D blood test they’d undergone within the past 12 months. That study found an inverse relationship between levels of vitamin D in the blood and the chances of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which persisted after researchers adjusted their model for demographic factors.
Taking extremely high doses of vitamin D supplements can cause toxicity, but Wagner says that based on studies she’s done, it’s “very safe” at the doses she recommends, namely, 4,000–6,000 international units (IU) per day for adults, depending on their BMI. Children, she says, should take about 50 IU per kilogram of body weight until they’re big enough to take the adult dose. The goal for both is to get to a concentration of between 40–60 nanograms per microliter in the blood, Wagner says.
Fire up the humidifier 
© ISTOCK.COM, YOCAMON
Along with a drop in sun exposure, winter’s arrival tends to herald a decline in humidity levels both indoors and out. Studies have indicated that viruses can travel further through drier air and remain stable for longer than they would at humidity levels above 40 percent, says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale University. In her own lab, she’s looked at the other side of the story—how dry air affects host defenses—and has found it’s bad news there, too. Based on her studies in rodents, some of them partly supported by humidifier company Condair, and work she’s seen in human subjects, she says that drier air thins the aqueous layer that lines our airways, which impairs the movement of cilia that work to expel viral particles. This leads to a scenario in which “the virus particles remain longer in the airway and therefore they have a chance to infect the cells, more so than if you are inhaling moist air,” she says. 
Iwasaki uses humidifiers in her own home with the aim of hitting a relative humidity level between 40 percent and 60 percent, she says, and she recommends the same to friends and family. “Having a whole house humidified would be great, but that’s kind of expensive,” she says. “But having even a small humidifier in the rooms, especially where you sleep, I think makes a difference.”
Tamp down aerosols 
SENSORY CLOUD
Another practice that appears to fortify the airways involves the mucus layer that sits under the aqueous layer. When we breathe, air rushing through our trachea and main bronchi breaks off bits of this layer, so that “when you breathe in, you generate little droplets in your upper airways that go deep. And when you breathe out, you breathe them out,” says David Edwards, a bioengineer who has studied the phenomenon for decades and is now the CEO of the company Sensory Cloud. Those droplets can in turn carry viruses into the lungs or out into the environment to potentially infect others. 
Edwards and his colleagues have found in a not-yet-published study that the number of smaller, aerosol-size exhaled droplets varies widely from person to person, with people who are older, have a high BMI, or are infected with COVID-19 tending to exhale more of them. “Typically, in a young person, there’s very few particles, which gets to the fact that the proper barrier function of mucus is such that it really resists that kind of breakup,” he says. 
In other work, such as a study published last week in Molecular Frontiers Journal, he and colleagues have found that inhaling a saline solution that contains calcium can reduce the number of aerosols a person exhales. That’s because, Edwards says, the positively charged calcium links negatively charged mucin proteins in the mucus, bolstering its surface tension and its resistance to sloughing off. That fortification should not only lower the number of small droplets a person exhales, but also reduce the chances that any virus that makes it into the upper airway will cause disease, he says. “If you can lower airborne movement of mucus in the upper airways, in the event that you’re infected, it lowers the probability that infection will spread to your deeper lungs where symptoms then arise.” He adds that using the calcium-fortified solution should complement wearing a surgical mask, with the treatment reducing exhalation of very small droplets and the mask catching larger ones. 
Sensory Cloud is now taking preorders for a $50 product, FEND, that delivers the calcium-containing solution; the company recommends that customers use it several times a day to cleanse their airways. The company hasn’t yet conducted clinical studies on whether FEND reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission or infection rates, Edwards says, but he’s hoping to study the product’s use soon in a high-risk setting such as a nursing home or prison.
Correction (October 12): The first paragraph of this article has been updated to state that it's been nine, not ten months since COVID-19 first crept into the headlines. The disease was first reported by the World Health Organization and international media in early January 2020. The Scientist regrets the error.
COVID-19 Diagnostics: How Do Saliva Tests Compare to Swabs?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, EVENFH
S
ince the early days of the pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been looking for alternatives to nasopharyngeal swabs. While samples collected from swabs are considered the gold standard in terms of generating accurate results, these tests require more supplies, place health care workers in closer contact with potentially infected individuals, and are difficult to scale up for mass testing. Saliva has been put forth as a low-cost, easy alternative, but it’s efficacy and accuracy remain points of contention.                                                      
Even as large universities have begun rolling out ambitious, saliva-based initiatives on campuses across the United States, private companies looking to develop rapid, in-home diagnostic tests have moved away from such tools. Trials of saliva-based testing being deployed in the field have yielded mixed results, and it remains unknown under what conditions saliva is most useful or how best it can be rolled into the existing testing framework.
We went into the jungle, into villages in the middle of the forest, and in very poor neighborhoods with mobile teams.
—Mathieu Nacher, Université de Guyane
Anne Wyllie, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, has studied the use of saliva as a source of genetic material for the last decade, and more recently has investigated saliva’s role in testing for COVID-19. Wyllie has been tracking the emergent literature during the pandemic to see how often saliva outperforms nasopharyngeal swabs. Across the almost 30 studies she has analyzed, “it’s almost half and half,” she says.
To test the efficacy of saliva herself, Wyllie and 50 colleagues did their own side-by-side comparison and recently authored a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine in which they reported the findings.
Among 70 patients admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital with suspected cases of COVID-19, saliva samples often contained more copies of SARS-CoV-2 than did swab samples, and a higher percentage of saliva samples were positive up to 10 days after the initial diagnosis. And when applied to 495 health care workers, saliva tests identified two more asymptomatic cases than swabs did, leading the team to conclude in their letter, “our findings provide support for the potential of saliva specimens in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
In controlled health care settings, at least, it seems that saliva can perform comparably to nasopharyngeal swabs. But COVID-19 is a global pandemic, and many of the hardest-hit communities are rural, poor, or otherwise underserved. And those conditions may influence just how well saliva-based tests work.
A head-to-head comparison in the jungle
French Guiana—a territory along the east coast of South America—has been heavily affected by COVID-19, with confirmed infections in more than 3 percent of the region’s roughly 300,000 residents. Through boat travel, the virus has radiated along a convoluted network of rivers to infect remote villages in the Amazon rainforest. 
Mathieu Nacher, an epidemiologist at the Université de Guyane in French Guiana, tells The Scientist that he was approached by the French government about conducting clinical trials, including a comparison between swabs and saliva, just after the outbreak’s peak in early July.
Between July 27 and September 10, mobile field teams collected paired samples from 776 people across French Guiana, traveling “into the jungle, into villages in the middle of the forest, and in very poor neighborhoods” to recruit participants, Nacher says.
By bringing the testing directly into the field, researchers could assess the efficacy of these screening tools in real-world scenarios. “This is where you can really see their utility,” Wyllie tells The Scientist. Her work has shown SARS-CoV-2 remains stable within saliva for long periods of time, even at room temperature—a characteristic that comes in handy in sampling situations when temperature regulation may come at a premium, or not at all. 
After being collected, samples were kept cool and transported to the hospital in the capital of Cayenne for processing within 24 hours. Both samples underwent the same extraction protocols and PCR test to screen for the presence of three viral genes, N, E, and RdRP.
I think that the saliva detection is actually more representative of who is infectious.
—Carolyn Banister, University of South Carolina
The results, shared September 24 on the preprint server medRxiv, show that among the 776 participants, 162 received positive diagnoses from at least one of the two methods; 76 cases from swabs, 10 from saliva, and 76 from both saliva and swabs. Sixty-one percent of those with COVID-19 reported experiencing mild symptoms, while 39 percent were asymptomatic.
Overall, saliva testing was less sensitive than nasopharyngeal swabs, although the results differed based on a person’s viral load. PCRs amplify target sequences in cycles, with each cycle doubling the amount of genetic material from the virus. The higher the starting concentration of virus, the fewer cycles needed to pass a cycle threshold (Ct). Medical professionals use this value to assess whether a person tests positive for COVID-19.
When the load was low, meaning the Ct number was large, the two methods disagreed more often. That’s because the virus is more difficult to detect using either method in people who have very recently become infected or those tested on the tail end of their illness. Among asymptomatic patients, saliva’s sensitivity was only 24 percent compared to swabs. 
The difference in performance between the two methods also varied by the viral gene amplified. The PCR test targeted all three genes at once, but an analysis of the data separating the detection of each gene showed the N gene, a region of the virus recommended for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was the least reliable, especially with low viral loads. Among symptomatic patients, agreement between the two methods was 77 percent on average, but when the researchers excluded results where the N gene was detected but the E and RdRP genes were not, it bumped up the agreement between swabs and saliva to 90 percent.
Nacher attributes some of his findings to the challenges of field sampling. In hospitals, people provide their saliva in the mornings, before eating or brushing their teeth. “Here, you get people who just drank a Coke,” he tells The Scientist. In addition, people only visit hospitals when their symptoms become so bad they require medical attention, meaning their viral loads are generally higher.
Still, Carolyn Banister, a pharmacologist at the University of South Carolina who has helped develop her school’s saliva test, says the study’s results are “really similar to some of the things” she has found in her own experiments, including discrepancies between the two tests when the viral load is low. “It’s kind of a preliminary study, because their numbers are fairly low,” Banister tells The Scientist. “But all the information coming out about COVID right now is somewhat preliminary. We have to take the new data in stride and incorporate new findings.”
Based on the results of the Nacher’s study, the French health authorities have officially declared that saliva testing may be used on symptomatic patients throughout France and its territories, although Nacher plans to continue studying the efficacy of saliva in detecting asymptomatic cases.
Saliva on college campuses
Used in the proper context, saliva may still be useful in tracking down even asymptomatic infections. College campuses across the US, for example, are using saliva-based tests to screen students and staff.
“Campus is a high-risk environment for transmission of the virus, so even if you don’t have the traditional symptoms, you’re still considered at risk,” Banister says. “Because of that . . . we wanted to make sure that college students who may not suffer any ill effects are also not contributing to our city-wide number of cases by spreading it.”
The University of South Carolina is using saliva to test as many as 1,200 students a day for COVID-19.
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA COMMUNICATIONS
The University of South Carolina, located in Columbia, recently began testing as many as 1,200 student volunteers a day using Banister’s saliva test, hoping to catch invisible infections in its students. Rather than testing each person once, the university has opened the testing up to students on a repeat basis, with results arriving within 24 hours. Through this mass testing, the university has identified clusters in campus fraternities and sororities, and as of today (October 9) has 33 active cases among students.
Even if the tests are not as sensitive as swabs, the sheer number and repetition makes it possible to catch an infection that may have been missed the day before. “If they’re people who might be coming regularly through a clinic, you’ll probably still get quite a bit of information, even if it wasn’t performing as sensitively,” Wyllie says. Testing on this scale with saliva also requires fewer supplies, such as the swabs and reagents that have become scarce during the pandemic, and people are more likely to sit for repeated tests if they only need to spit into a cup. 
Banister also recruited two students living in the same house—one with a confirmed diagnosis and one at risk of contracting the virus—to undergo pairwise, daily sampling for comparisons between swabs and saliva. She found that over the first two weeks of the infection, there was a “remarkable” concurrence between the cycle numbers detected in saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs in the positive patient (the at-risk student never tested positive), meaning that saliva “is as sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swab,” Banister tells The Scientist.
At the end of two weeks, the two samples diverged, with swabs continuing to detect virus for several more days. Banister attributes this finding not to a higher sensitivity of the swab test, but to the mechanics of the human body: saliva turns over much more quickly in the mouth, while the lungs and nasal cavity can hold the virus for longer, leading to positive results even when a person may no longer be infectious. 
How a positive diagnosis relates to infectiousness—and how clinicians should use Ct numbers to decide if someone should remain quarantined—isn’t yet clear. The next step, all three researchers agree, will be to look into these questions. Based on her preliminary findings, Banister says, “I think that the saliva detection is actually more representative of who is infectious.” 
A Challenge Trial for COVID-19 Would Not Be the First of Its Kind/-/ABOVE: Volunteer Molly Perry receives an injection of malaria sporozoites from Jim Kublin at the Fred Hutch–based Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center as part of a challenge study.

A
s the 2009 pandemic flu virus infected millions around the world, Matthew Memoli began planning to expose healthy volunteers to the pathogen—a proposal that met with considerable opposition. The scientific community was divided on whether the approach was ethical or even warranted. 
As the director of the Clinical Studies Unit at the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Memoli recognized the value of a so-called challenge trial for flu, and there was precedent for conducting one. “Our current vaccine and most of the antivirals that we use for flu were all developed in some part because of challenge studies,” says Memoli. But at the time he was applying for regulatory approval in 2010, it had been a decade since anyone had done a flu challenge study. 
He made his case for reviving the approach to address the ongoing pandemic virus. He argued to numerous groups that a controlled exposure that mimicked what people could encounter in the real world would allow researchers to track subjects’ immune responses and test drugs and vaccines efficiently and with far fewer people than would be needed for traditional clinic trials. In the end, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ethics review board agreed with him, and he developed a challenge model using a wildtype strain of H1N1 that has since been sprayed up the noses of more than 400 volunteers.
While I’m a proponent of challenge models, I think there are some ethical requirements and those include having a significant knowledge of the long-term effects of the infection.
—Monica McArthur, University of Maryland School of Medicine 
“I personally take this very seriously. I’m making people sick on purpose. It’s not a joke; it’s a very serious thing that I’m doing. And I only want to be doing it if it really is truly something that is beneficial,” Memoli says. 
Ten years later, Memoli is once again working on developing a human challenge model for a pandemic virus—this time, SARS-CoV-2. It’s not yet clear whether it will be used to test out vaccines or even therapeutics for COVID-19, he says, but “I have always believed that we should be preparing to do it.” 
Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, a debate has focused on whether a challenge study for COVID-19 vaccines should proceed. In June, an advisory group to the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report providing guidelines for how such trials could be designed, but the committee was undecided over whether they could ethically proceed. Late last month, the Financial Times reported that the UK government announced it was considering a vaccine challenge trial for COVID-19 that could start early next year. (Imperial College London and the contract research organization hVivo, reportedly partnering on the trial, did not respond to requests for comment before deadline.)
For many pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, challenge studies have already become a key part of research on vaccines and therapeutics. Besides influenza, scientists have developed challenge models for an array of other viruses as well as bacteria and parasites. “I think challenge studies have become more accepted, honestly,” says Memoli. “Since I started doing the flu challenge, I think there was a big resurgence.”
Determining the challenge
The first step in conducting a challenge study is to design the challenge—that is, what the researchers will expose study participants to. The strain, dose, and administration are considered, and the approach varies widely depending on the pathogen. The goal is to elicit a consistent response in a majority of volunteers while ensuring everyone’s safety. 
When clinical researcher Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and her collaborators at NIAID began developing a challenge model of dengue several years ago, they started with two naturally attenuated strains they hoped could serve as proxies for the more dangerous forms of the virus to test vaccines; the goal wasn’t to make people sick but simply to infect them. The researchers wanted to be able to see the virus in cell cultures grown from blood samples from at least 80 percent of volunteers before they began challenge trials to test an experimental vaccine. 
There is no effective rescue treatment and we have no way of predicting who may have serious complications due to infection.
—David Diemert, George Washington University
The researchers started with 10 participants who received 1,000 virus particles by subcutaneous injection, and all 10 developed an infection. They had an average of only about 300 virus particles per milliliter of blood, however—a far lower concentration than the 10,000 to 100,000 viruses per milliliter of blood typical of natural dengue infections. Several volunteers got a typical dengue rash over their whole body, but none got a fever. In 2016, Durbin and her colleagues published the results of a challenge trial of 41 volunteers showing a vaccine candidate to be 100 percent effective—none of the 21 participants who received the vaccine developed viremia when challenged with the virus whereas all 20 who didn’t get vaccinated did—prompting Brazil’s Butantan Institute to license the vaccine technology and launch an ongoing Phase 3 trial.
In other cases, researchers use the wildtype pathogen in an attempt to replicate natural disease. For challenge models of influenza, Memoli says, it’s important to actually induce illness. When it comes to respiratory viruses such as flu and SARS-CoV-2, he explains, a vaccine might not prevent infection, but rather reduce symptom severity, shorten the course of the disease, or limit the pathogen’s spread—effects researchers may miss if the challenge simply causes infection but not sickness. 
So far, Memoli says, developing a challenge model for SARS-CoV-2 has been “a bit simpler” than it was for flu, partly because the novel coronavirus has not yet evolved significantly different strains. “Really all the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that have been identified have pretty much the same properties,” he notes, and moreover, the coronavirus has proven relatively easy to grow in the lab. But there’s still a long way to go, Memoli adds, noting that his protocol must still be reviewed by the FDA—which must approve the proposed pathogen challenge as an investigational new drug before it is administered to people for an initial validation study—and an NIH institutional review board, as well as other committees. “We have lots to do over the next few months to even determine if everyone felt comfortable doing this before we could even make the decision to move forward,” he says. 
If a challenge trial were to proceed, the first study would simply serve to validate the model, enrolling only 5 to 10 people to receive a relatively low dose of pathogen. If the exposure proved safe enough, the researchers would expand the study and likely test higher doses until they are able to trigger illness in enough participants—typically at least 60–80 percent—to power future vaccine and drug trials.
With many labs now having characterized viral stocks of SARS-CoV-2, “that standardization and the qualification of the challenge material is one of the challenges that the coronavirus field is overcoming right now,” says Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Jim Kublin, who conducts challenge studies of malaria. But, he adds, “given the pace at which we’re moving into these [COVID-19] vaccine studies, I’m skeptical” that a challenge trial would accelerate vaccine development.
Ensuring participants’ safety
A consistent and safe exposure is just the first requirement of a challenge study. After the challenge is delivered to volunteers, researchers must be prepared to care for the participants if they get sick, and make sure they don’t transmit the infection to others.

In some cases, that’s easy. In Kublin’s challenge studies of malaria, patients can simply go home after their exposure. Because Anopheles mosquitos that carry malaria parasites do not live in Washington State, there is no risk of them biting an infected person from the trial and spreading the disease, and the researchers closely monitor the participants’ blood for evidence of the parasite. Once it makes it into the person’s circulation, it must mature for another two weeks. By the time a volunteer might start to feel sick, they’ve been diagnosed and treated, says Kublin, who has used the model to test experimental vaccines and treatments. 
The situation is similarly benign in challenge studies of hookworm. While chronic infections with the parasite can cause gastrointestinal distress, anemia, and other complications in areas where it’s endemic, people who have volunteered to allow larvae of the pathogen to burrow through the skin on their arm don’t get sick, likely because of the relatively low dose and participants’ good nutrition, say Jeff Bethony and David Diemert, codirectors of George Washington University’s Vaccine Research Unit who are now conducting a hookworm vaccine challenge trial. (The Vaccine Research Unit is also a site of the Phase 3 trial of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.) The researchers confirm infection by looking for eggs in participants’ stool samples, and then treat them with a medication called albendazole that kills the worms. A few volunteers have agreed to remain infected and provide stool samples from which the team can harvest eggs for a new batch of larvae for the next challenge study. Diemert notes that it’s “almost impossible” for participants to spread the disease to others if they are using a toilet. 
In other cases, the pathogen presents enough of a risk to the exposed individual or to others that trial participants must stay for a period of time at an in-patient facility under quarantine. Such is the case when Johns Hopkins University infectious disease researcher David Sack has conducted vaccine challenge studies of cholera and other enteric bacteria. The team members use strains they know can be killed by an antibiotic, which volunteers are given, along with fluids, as soon as they meet the clinical criteria for having developed the illness. 
Similarly, participants who receive Memoli’s flu challenge stay in quarantine for one to two weeks, until they test negative for the flu on two consecutive days, although they don’t receive antiviral treatment so as to observe the infection take its course. Memoli notes that the need for an extended quarantine of perhaps three weeks for a SARS-CoV-2 challenge would be a hinderance, though not an insurmountable obstacle.
Considerations for a COVID-19 challenge trial
The more contentious part of the debate over whether a challenge study for COVID-19 should proceed is the risk to the individuals being deliberately exposed to the novel coronavirus, which is still very much an unknown—and one that can cause fatal disease. So far, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 1 million lives around the globe, including more than 200,000 in the US. (In contrast, during the 2019–2020 flu season, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, there were between 24,000 and 62,000 flu-related deaths.) The Financial Times reports that the UK trial will treat participants who fall ill with remdesivir, a drug that appears to expedite recovery.
Researchers must be prepared to care for the participants if they get sick, and make sure they don’t transmit the infection to others.
“Personally, I do not think that it is ethical at this time to conduct COVID-19 challenge vaccine trials,” says Diemert. “There is no effective rescue treatment and we have no way of predicting who may have serious complications due to infection.” Sack agrees: “We say in general that young people don’t get as sick, but we also know that some young people die.” 
There’s also the risk that surviving participants could suffer long-term consequences, says Monica McArthur, a physician-scientist in the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “While I’m a proponent of challenge models, I think there are some ethical requirements, and those include having a significant knowledge of the long-term effects of the infection.”
In making the evaluation of whether a COVID-19 challenge trial is warranted, the risks must be balanced with the need. As several researchers noted to The Scientist, there are many COVID-19 vaccine candidates in late-stage trials, with results expected over the next several months. If one or more of these studies yields results that support the vaccine’s approval, a challenge trial may not be necessary.
Challenge trials may be warranted when there isn’t enough disease transmission in the community to determine if a vaccine is protective, says Durbin, who adds that there is currently no shortage of natural COVID-19 spread in the population. “When you’ve got diseases that occur in sporadic outbreaks and you can’t necessarily predict when or where those outbreaks will occur to plan for a traditional Phase 3 efficacy study, challenge studies can be very useful,” says Durbin, who is developing a human challenge model for Zika for that reason. But back in 2016, when she and her colleagues first proposed a Zika human challenge model because they realized that the Zika outbreak was waning, the FDA told them that “it was unethical at the time to do a Zika challenge model,” Durbin says, in large part because there were still so many Zika cases. “But now we’re talking about a COVID-19 challenge trial. That kind of blows my mind.” 
Nevertheless, Durbin and others say it’s too soon to take the possibility of future challenge studies off the table. With so many moving parts, you never know what the future holds. “I count myself among the many who are still waiting for more information on the COVID virus that would be used as the challenge strain, the state of vaccines in the near future (i.e., How urgent is this by next year?), and any advances in COVID therapeutics,” Bethony tells The Scientist in an email.
Memoli is also a “maybe” on whether the SARS-CoV-2 challenge model he’s currently developing should ever be used to give people COVID-19. “As we look to see what happens here over the next few months, in terms of the vaccine, in terms of the disease itself and its spread in the world, we’ll have to make some decisions,” he says. For now, he reiterates, “we should definitely be preparing.”
Stomach Acid & Heartburn Drugs Linked with COVID-19 Outcomes/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BWFOLSOM
T
he uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic has made our stomachs churn, and now, evidence suggests that intense heartburn may be linked with worse symptoms of the disease. Some drugs that neutralize stomach acid, such as famotidine, which President Donald Trump is taking, are associated with reduced severity, but others, such as Prilosec, correlate with higher infection rates and risk of death, at least in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections.
“Everyone has some level of acid reflux,” says Helder Nakaya, a systems biologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who has been studying the link between stomach acid and SARS-CoV-2 infection. “But I want to be clear . . . we cannot claim that this increased risk of death would apply to everyone with reflux.” The link does suggest that stomach acid might be a factor that’s often overlooked when it comes to COVID-19, Nakaya says.
In a retrospective analysis posted on medRxiv of roughly 1,300 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, Nakaya and colleagues found that individuals taking proton-pump inhibitors, including Prilosec, had a two- to three-fold higher risk of death compared with hospitalized patients not taking those drugs. This observation falls in line with a study published in late August in the American Journal of Gastroenterology by doctors in the US that also found people taking a proton-pump inhibitor twice a day for acid reflux had higher odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with individuals taking that type of drug once a day or individuals who took a histamine-2 receptor blocker such as Pepcid AC. 
Proton-pump inhibitors “may undermine the gastric barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry and reduce microbial diversity in the gut,” increasing patients’ risk getting COVID-19, the US-based team writes in its report.
Another retrospective analysis published online in Gastroenterology in May found that in a cohort of 1,620 hospitalized patients, proton-pump inhibitors had no relationship to the patients’ outcomes. Meanwhile, famotidine, which blocks the histamine-2 receptor on cells, correlated with a reduced risk of patients being intubated or dying from COVID-19. 
Prior to analyzing that larger dataset, the authors had heard anecdotal evidence that famotidine might make COVID-19 symptoms less severe, and they’d heard that a few in vitro experiments also backed up the idea, study coauthor Joseph Conigliaro, the division chief of general internal medicine in the Department of Medicine at Northwell Health in Manhasset, New York, tells The Scientist in an email. In April, Northwell partnered with Alchem Laboratories and launched a randomized clinical trial to test whether giving up to 360 milligrams of famotidine intravenously to COVID-19 patients would improve their health outcomes compared with patients who received standard of care treatment. The trial later came under fire with a government whistleblower complaint for being hastily approved with little evidence and for the high doses of the drug being used, according to the Associated Press. Still, Northwell’s research on famotidine continued.
“Neither the whistleblower complaint or the AP story had much of an effect on us. However, they are part of an overall trend to politicize Covid-19 clinical trials and prospective therapies that is deeply unfortunate,” Matthew Libassi, a spokesperson for the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, the research arm of Northwell, writes in an email to The Scientist. “That trend concerns us as it makes it harder to conduct medical science research.” 
Despite the pushback, additional evidence for famotidine’s role in fighting viruses has surfaced. A past study published in 1996 had shown that famotidine could reduce viral replication of HIV, and a more recent computational analysis published in May also suggested that the histamine blocker could have some antiviral properties—specifically, that it might inhibit a protease that processes proteins vital for SARS-CoV-2 replication.
The computational results offered “some biological plausibility” to the hypothesis that famotidine could reduce the severity of COVID-19, but “in the end I think the computational models do not tell the whole picture,” Conigliaro says. That’s why he and his colleagues conducted their retrospective study on patients admitted to the hospital between February 25 and April 13 (these patients were not part of Northwell’s clinical trial testing famotidine). Analysis of the data revealed a distinct difference in the overall health outcomes of the patients taking famotidine compared with patients not given the drug. (Why the patients were given famotidine is not clear, though some had a history of gastric reflux and were taking the medication prior to being admitted to the hospital.)
“I expected a difference, but not so pronounced,” Conigliaro says. “I was also surprised that doses as low as what was used is the retrospective study would work that well. We had anticipated that bigger doses would be needed.” In the study, some patients received up to 20 milligrams of famotidine per day for five days intravenously, while others received it orally; when used for acid reflux, patients can take as much as 160 milligrams four times a day. Those who got the drug in the hospital fared better than those who did not, the study found.  
Julian Abrams, a gastroenterologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital and a collaborator of Conigliaro, notes that the link between famotidine and reduced severity of COVID-19 is still only correlational at this point, but nevertheless warrants more attention.
Stomach acid and ACE2
Nakaya’s work offers a bit more insight into potential mechanisms. He and his team weren’t initially planning to look at the relationship between antacids and COVID-19 at all. Their project began as an offshoot of another one that Nakaya’s graduate student, Leandro Jimenez, had started. Jimenez had been analyzing the transcriptome data of patients with Barrett’s esophagus, a condition in which acid reflux causes damage to the lining of the esophagus. 
The data from biopsies and a gene expression repository revealed increased expression of the gene ACE2, which encodes a cell surface protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells, in individuals with Barrett’s esophagus compared with individuals who did not have the condition. That increased gene activity was tied to regulation of intracellular pH pathways, specifically, their enrichment. That connection suggests increased ACE2 expression is linked with lower pH inside cells, possibly a result of exposure to stomach acid. 
“And that raised a flag,” Nakaya says, which led his team to hypothesize that Barrett’s esophagus, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), may be a comorbidities of COVID-19 that hadn’t been identified before.
To test the link between stomach acid and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, Nakaya’s team exposed human monocytes in cell culture to different pH conditions and then to SARS-CoV-2. The researchers used these immune cells because they are known to be susceptible to infection by the coronavirus, Nakaya says. Under normal oxygen levels, the cells in culture with a pH lower than 7.4 had a higher expression of ACE2 and also a higher viral load. The result indicates that intracellular pH may influence the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and replicate within them.
But it wasn’t clear, says Nakaya, that the finding would have any clinical relevance, so the team dug into the medical records of patients in Manaus and São Paulo, Brazil, who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and found that proton-pump inhibitors correlated with an increased risk of death. That association, Nakaya says, suggests that it might not be the drugs themselves that lead to worsening COVID-19 symptoms, but instead that the proton-pump inhibitors are, the team writes, “important markers of hidden comorbidities that involve the damage caused by the excess stomach acid in GI tissues.” In other words, the low pH that cells are dealing with—and that patients are trying to treat with a proton-pump inhibitor—might make the cells more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The results, however, don’t explain why famotidine correlated with better outcomes in Conigliaro and Abrams’s study, supposing the drug is also used to suppress stomach acid. “We don’t think that stomach acid is the explanation for the findings,” says Abrams. “We really don’t know why we found what we did.”
The past work on HIV and the computational analysis suggest that famotidine works as an antiviral, and a study published today (October 7) also supports that idea. The research shows that ranitidine bismuth citrate, another histamine antagonist and antibiotic combo used to treat stomach acid, suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves their virus-related pneumonia symptoms. But famotidine, Conigliaro says, may have benefits other than being antiviral; it may actually prevent patients’ immune systems from overreacting to a SARS-CoV-2 infection and causing a life-threatening cytokine storm. There’s some evidence for this from an observational study in which patients severely ill with COVID-19 were given a cocktail of histamine blockers, one of which was famotidine, and had better outcomes than did patients receiving the standard of care whose cases were reported elsewhere. Those data and other research “seem to suggest that the anti-histamine effect is what prevents patients from getting the cytokine storm,” Conigliaro explains, noting that cells with the histamine-2 receptor are in the lungs as well as the stomach. 
The results from those studies and his team’s work, he says, bolster the case for the clinical trial launched last spring to test famotidine as a treatment for COVID-19, results of which are still pending. The Department of Defense under the Discovery of Medical Countermeasures Against Novel Entities, or DOMANE, program is also studying famotidine as a COVID-19 treatment, according to Vanity Fair, and another famotidine trial in Bangladesh is also now recruiting patients. 
“Most people’s attention is shifting towards vaccines rather than treatments,” Abrams says, but “with President Trump having COVID, that brings to light again the issue of treatments, especially since he was getting famotidine.”
What We Know About Donald Trump’s COVID-19 Treatment Plan/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WELLESENTERPRISES
O
n Thursday, October 1, it was announced that President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and other White House officials had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His symptoms worsened and on Friday evening, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. 
There has been some mixed messaging with the actual timeline of when he received his diagnosis and began a treatment regimen, as The New York Times reports, and doctors can only speculate on his prognosis.
Here is what is currently known about the drugs Trump has been taking to combat his illness:
Antibodies 
One of the first reported treatments Trump received was an experimental cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron. Trump was intravenously given eight grams of the cocktail, which is the highest dose used during the drug’s small, 245-person clinical trial. According to a September press release from Regeneron, the drug is meant to treat non-hospitalized patients and boost the patient’s immune response, decreasing viral load. 
Remdesivir 
On Friday, Trump also received his first dose of remdesivir, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola infections. Prior to the pandemic, it was shown in vitro to be effective against the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, suggesting it could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Further testing of the drug in COVID-19 patients, given over the course of five days, showed that it was effective in treating severe disease in patients with pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen. In late August, the drug received emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Association for patients with severe cases.
Dexamethasone 
On Saturday, Trump received dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that mitigates inflammation in the lungs and tempers the patient’s immune system. The drug has a long history of use for a wide variety of ailments, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and certain endocrine disorders, and has been on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medications since 1977. Over the summer, a study showed that the drug is also useful in treating severe COVID-19, reducing the mortality rate by 20 percent.
“I think we were all astonished to see how effective it was,” the University of Oxford’s Richard Haynes, who is one of the leaders of the trial, wrote in an email to The Scientist in June. “We tested it because we believed it could be effective, but I don’t think anyone was expecting to see quite such large effects.”
As reported by the Times, the President was receiving supplemental oxygen when his levels dipped below 95 percent. 
An October 2 memo from Trump’s physician reveals that in addition to these interventions, he has also been taking daily aspirin, melatonin (a supplement to aid in sleep), zinc, and famotidine, an antacid sold under the tradename Pepcid. 
The memo also noted that Trump has been given vitamin D supplements. In August, a study found a connection to low vitamin D levels and susceptibility to COVID-19. It is not clear if these supplements are part of routine health maintenance or his coronavirus infection care.
Notably absent from the President’s treatment plan is hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial that Trump has touted as a promising treatment throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, even after it was shown to be largely ineffective and potentially harmful. In May, Trump claimed to have taken a two-week-long preventive dose of the drug. In late July, he was still tweeting about the drug, long after its emergency use authorization had been rescinded. The tweet has since been deleted.
Correction (October 6): A previous version of the story incorrectly identified the date President Trump’s diagnosis was announced. The Scientist regrets the error.
The Pandemic Continues to Put a Damper on Faculty Hiring/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
BAONA
A
s the Great Recession in the US was beginning in 2008, chemical engineer Andrea Armani got several emails in response to her applications for faculty jobs thanking her for applying, but explaining that the search had been canceled, at least in part due to financial uncertainty.
It was likely a disappointment faced by a number of would-be academic researchers. According to a 2019 report by the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, new assistant professor hires were on the rise until 2008, when they began a steady decline that lasted until 2016.
Postdocs across the US faced similar disappointment this spring, as searches were canceled due to financial struggles at institutions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. And as the faculty hiring season ramps up this fall, ongoing hiring freezes, lower numbers of faculty positions, and uncertainty about what the job market will look like beyond this year have trainees worrying about the future.
“You put in a lot of work—both your life’s work into training . . . and writing what you feel is the best application packet you can—only to receive an email about something that’s completely out of your control,” Armani says. “It’s just completely demoralizing.”
“In general, the mood is tense—even more so than usual,” says Pearl Ryder, a postdoc at the Broad Institute. She runs Future PI Slack, an online community of more than 350 biomedical postdocs who aim to eventually run their own labs. On the community, there’s a spreadsheet to track faculty job listings. Last year, they had 97 jobs listed with application deadlines of October 1 or earlier. This year, they have 35 jobs with the same deadline.
Other informal data support a lower availability of jobs this hiring season. The chemjobber blog, which curates available faculty jobs in chemistry, reported on September 29 that there are 99 research and teaching positions listed, in contrast to 354 similar positions at this time last year. And neurorumblr, a crowdsourced spreadsheet of neuroscience faculty jobs administered by Princeton postdoc Adam Calhoun, likewise indicates that job postings are way down from 2019.

“The whole academic job market is so frustrating, because you have these yearlong cycles where you apply in the fall, and you hope to hear maybe in the winter or the spring, and then if you don’t get a job, you have to sit around for another year,” Calhoun, who is looking for a job this year, tells The Scientist.
“When COVID hit, a lot of searches were canceled or put on hold, and a lot of institutions instituted either yearlong or even two-year-long bans on hiring,” he says. “This added to this backlog of people searching for jobs. People who thought they’d get jobs last year didn’t get them so there are even more on the market this year. And that, combined with the number of jobs available, is making things even worse.”
Career consulting website The Professor Is In has collected an unofficial list of institutions with hiring freezes with more than 400 entries. 
In a Twitter poll administered on September 10 by Denis Wirtz, the vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins University, about half of 1,056 people responded that their insitution has a hiring freeze in place. The other half responded that hiring was either ongoing but reduced or proceeding normally—a data point Wirtz found surprising.
“I was, in this COVID-19 era, under the impression that many more universities would be really slowing down recruitment, if not blocking it altogether,” Wirtz tells The Scientist. And the interpretation of hiring freezes can vary widely, he adds. For instance, Johns Hopkins officially has a hiring freeze in place, but individual department chairs and faculty can make a case for recruitment, especially in focal research areas such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and climate change. The university is also contractually obligated to continue recruiting for major gifts, which often come with money earmarked for professorships.
“In other words, it’s not all black. It’s not all white. It’s, as usual, a bit in between those two extremes,” Wirtz says.
For instance, according to William LaCourse, dean of the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, there is a hiring freeze in place for staff and vacant faculty slots have been temporarily removed from budgets. But because the university has made a commitment to the continuation of academic programs, appeals for hiring faculty could be made, he says.
Postdocs reflect on career choices
Not only do hiring freezes differ across institutions, Jenn Kong, a postdoc at Stanford University who is on the job market this year, tells The Scientist that some places appear to be continuing with faculty recruitment as usual. She curates a list of biology faculty jobs and points out that a few institutions, such as UT Southwestern, have postings for several tenure track positions.
Despite the institutions that are hiring, postdocs “are feeling pretty down in general,” Kong says. “The thing that I think most people are worried about is if it’s actually going to get better next year. We’re hoping that universities start to open up jobs again, because they’ll realize that maybe their financial situation isn’t as bad. But at least with Stanford, we don’t know when the undergrads are coming back, and that’s been a huge financial loss for the school.”
Amid all the financial challenges, academic science may also experience a loss of people if postdocs can’t find jobs and decide to do something else. Fewer faculty jobs “means a lot of great scientists are going to decide not to go the academic track and, as LeBron said, bring their talent elsewhere,” says Wirtz.
“We are seeing people changing routes,” agrees Stephanie Eberle, vice chair of the board of the National Postdoctoral Association. Many postdocs thought academia was going to be consistent and secure for the long term, Eberle adds, and now it looks like it’s not. “The secret to any career choice is understanding yourself and what you want, so a slow down allows you to do that. In a recession, it just takes longer to get a job, and the longer that takes the more time you have for reflection and to think about exactly what you want.”
Another important consideration regarding postdocs who might opt out of the academic track is “the unequal burden that some people are experiencing right now because of work from home,” says Barbara Natalizio, the chair of the board of the National Postdoctoral Association. Unlike a lot of other recessions where financial concerns are primary, the pandemic and the social and economic turmoil it has caused in the US may make it much harder for some people to be on the job market, Eberle tells The Scientist. Learning how to do virtual interviews is a challenge, they say. And “if I have two children around and my partner works or I’m a single parent, that’s an additional burden beyond the recession.”
See “Gender Gap in Research Output Widens During Pandemic”
Armani did get a job in 2008 and is now a chaired professor at the University of Southern California. She acknowledges that what trainees experienced during the 2008 recession is not to the same level as current pandemic-related hiring concerns, but says that “the sense of frustration that postdocs are going through right now” is familiar.
To support early-career researchers who are on the academic market this year or have just started their labs, Armani has organized a free virtual workshop for November 4 and 5. More than 400 people have already registered. In addition to discussing what to expect when job hunting and becoming a new PI in a pandemic, she wants to try to minimize stress for these researchers.
“Anything I can do to try to reduce the number of questions, I feel I should do,” she says. “We’re all stressed enough.”

Wielding Fear/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, AVESUN
F
ear is in the air. People everywhere have been navigating a potentially deadly new reality, living for months under the weight of a seemingly relentless pandemic. Economies, hobbled by the severe disruption to business as usual, struggle to regain a foothold, and many livelihoods hang in the balance. In addition, a US presidential election, arguably the most contentious in modern history, looms on the horizon, and some politicians are capitalizing on the fear-filled climate to achieve their personal, policy, and electoral goals. 
This month’s Reading Frames essay, from University of California, Los Angeles, animal behavior researcher Daniel Blumstein, discusses the ecological power and evolutionary history of fear. The emotion has for millennia helped species avoid being eaten, and a balanced approach to risk-benefit analysis has helped some individuals prosper and multiply while others succumbed to starvation or predation due to an over- or under-abundance of caution, respectively. “Fear,”  Blumstein writes, “is an essential ingredient in healthy ecosystems and helps maintain biodiversity.” But the emotion can sometimes overtake sound thinking, and that potential imbalance has utility in the political realm, Blumstein notes. “[Fear] makes us vulnerable to politicians with malevolent intentions who make compelling advertisements that efficiently tap into our well-honed neurophysiological fear systems.”
While editing Blumstein’s piece for this issue, I started to think of the overabundance of fear that lingers in our collective consciousness and colors our day-to-day existence. Not even my seven-year-old daughter is immune. “Dad, can you turn the news off?” she recently said in the car after hearing a radio report about an eight-year-old child who was shot in Chicago. “It scares me.” With a pang in my heart, I muted the radio. In that moment, fear was something to avoid, to run from. But perhaps we need to rethink our relationship with the emotion.
ANDRZEJ KRAUZE
Blumstein writes that fear can be useful and constructive in many situations and across many species. The scared marmot that cowers in its burrow as a golden eagle soars above has its fear to thank for saving its skin. But if the marmot doesn’t balance that fear with the courage necessary to seek food and mates, it could starve or otherwise fail to pass on its genetic legacy. This is what we risk when fear runs amok. I think it’s what Franklin D. Roosevelt was getting at in the opening of his 1933 inaugural address: “. . . the only thing we have to fear is fear itself . . .” What followed this frequently cited phrase really drives home FDR’s point: “. . .  nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”
Far be it from me to disagree with FDR’s famous sentiment, which I interpret as a call to trust in the country’s leaders in a time of peril and upheaval as the US economy grappled with the Great Depression. But in our own challenging times, I would suggest that we embrace fear, rather than fearing or avoiding it. A healthy measure of fear can help us make smarter choices—wearing a mask at the grocery store, driving safely, investing wisely in the stock market, deferring to the advice of public health experts, etc. An overactive sense of fear can indeed be problematic, clouding our vision and leading us astray from our foundational ethics and morals. But on the other end of that spectrum, if we seek an existence free from fear, we are rejecting an elemental force that has shaped the course of our evolution and the functioning of our living planet.
We must strike the same balance that successful marmots and our forebears achieved: have enough fear to modulate our behavior in constructive ways, but not so much that we abandon our values or squander opportunities. This is where the use of fearmongering by some in the political realm is particularly nefarious. To accomplish short-term political goals, such as getting votes or donations, some individuals are perfectly OK with sowing the seeds of terror. And in doing so, they often push logic, science, rationality, and kindness to the periphery.
It is my sincere hope that as we progress through this challenging year, we realize that there are things that we should fear and that our trepidation, appropriately contextualized, will lead us in the right direction. But we must remain vigilant to avoid forsaking our humanity by engaging in an overactive, imagined, or exploited sense of dread. Let’s stop fearing fear so that we can understand it and use it to make ourselves, one another, and the world better.

The Brain’s Immune Cells Stand Sentinel Against Viral Invasion/-/ABOVE: T cells (red) in the olfactory bulb of mice engage with antigens on vesicular stomatitis virus, leading to cell signaling (green) that ultimately prevents neuronal death.

ailure to smell fresh cut grass or a poo-laden diaper is, at least these days, a potential sign of COVID-19 infection. “People say things smell funny or they can’t smell at all,” says Harvard University neurobiologist Sandeep Datta. Reading about people’s experiences of anosmia, Datta wondered how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might be having this effect. One possibility was that the virus attacks cells that line and support olfactory neurons in the nose. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 could be directly targeting the neurons themselves.
Datta’s and other researchers’ work—which so far includes genetic and cellular analyses in humans, rodents, and monkeys—suggests that mammalian olfactory neurons don’t have the right cell receptors for the virus to get inside them, meaning that the lack of smell most likely comes from the infection of olfactory support cells. But not everyone is convinced by the data; some researchers continue to argue that SARS-CoV-2 can infect neurons in the nose and ultimately invade the brain this way.
Microglia were gobbling up bits of the virus from infected neurons in the olfactory bulb.
If the virus were able to enter olfactory neurons, it’s in theory a “very short route,” along a single neuron, from nose to brain, notes pathologist Debby van Riel of Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. Van Riel, who began studying influenza’s ability to attack nerve fibers involved in olfaction decades ago, says she’s not convinced SARS-CoV-2 can infect olfactory neurons. But the discussion has reminded scientists how little they know about viral invasion through the nose. That’s why, she says, she was fascinated to read about recent experiments by Duke University immunologist Ashley Moseman and colleagues that tracked immune responses in mice that had had vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) squirted up their noses. 
VSV is known to infect olfactory neurons in mice. The team was interested in what Moseman calls a “sneaky front door” for this virus to travel via nerve fibers that project from the nasal cavity and connect with neurons deeper in the brain. Mice that get the virus don’t die from the infection, even if it enters the brain, and they don’t suffer significant brain damage, either. Interested in how the mice avoided this damage,  Moseman and his colleagues decided to tag VSV particles with fluorescent markers, then inject them into the mice’s noses to see if the team could uncover how the immune system responded to the infection. 
The fluorescent imaging showed that VSV was infecting neuronal fibers in the nose and also neurons farther up in the olfactory bulb leading to the brain. “VSV gets into neurons in the nose and actually kills those neurons,” says study coauthor Dorian McGavern, a viral immunologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “But those neurons can grow back. They can replenish the system and restore sense of smell.” Neurons farther up in the brain can’t be regenerated, yet, oddly, they didn’t appear to die after infection.

Probing further, Moseman, McGavern, and their colleagues revealed how those neurons that sat deeper in the brain were spared. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain, were gobbling up bits of the virus from infected neurons in the olfactory bulb. Although not getting infected themselves, the microglia were projecting those viral bits, like flags, on their cell surfaces, attracting killer T cells in the blood to come to the brain and mount an immune defense against the microglia, rather than against the infected neurons, which also display viral bits on their surfaces. The interaction between the microglia and the killer T cells led the T cells to release cytokines that triggered the elimination of the virus from infected neurons without killing those neurons in the process, the team found. “Microglia are playing an absolutely critical role here in protecting neurons within the brain,” McGavern says.
What’s not yet clear is if the killer T cells do, in fact, kill the virus-flaunting
microglia or whether the two types of immune cells interact in some other way to spur T cells to release the virus-eradicating cytokines. “It’s possible that microglia sort of take that hit on behalf of everybody,” Moseman says, “and in doing so T cells avoid going to try to engage with neurons, which don’t replenish themselves very well.” Microglia are replaceable, he speculates, so losing them might be less consequential than the irreversible damage of neuronal death.
The work offers a glimpse at how the body and brain respond to invasion of viruses such as VSV through the nose, van Riel says. “If you know the way the body can handle an infection without causing severe [brain] damage, it could lead to new insights, which could lead to therapeutic strategies.” However, scientists still don’t yet have a good grasp of which viruses can enter the central nervous system this way. That may change as more researchers investigate whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can. The work might even suggest that each and every virus elicits a unique immune response in the brain, van Riel notes. “I think we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

The Surgisphere Scandal: What Went Wrong?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ENOT-POLOSKUN
I
t sounds absurd that an obscure US company with a hastily constructed website could have driven international health policy and brought major clinical trials to a halt within the span of a few weeks. Yet that’s what happened earlier this year, when Illinois-based Surgisphere Corporation began a publishing spree that would trigger one of the largest scientific scandals of the COVID-19 pandemic to date.
At the heart of the deception was a paper published in The Lancet on May 22 that suggested hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug promoted by US President Donald Trump and others as a therapy for COVID-19, was associated with an increased risk of death in patients hospitalized with the disease. The study wasn’t a randomized controlled trial—the gold standard for determining a drug’s safety and efficacy—but it did purportedly draw from an enormous registry of observational data that Surgisphere claimed to have collected from the electronic medical records of nearly 100,000 COVID-19 patients across 671 hospitals on six continents.
The study was a medical and political bombshell. News outlets analyzed the implications for what they referred to as the “drug touted by Trump.” Within days, public health bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) instructed organizers of clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment or prophylaxis to suspend recruitment, while the French government reversed an earlier decree allowing the drug to be prescribed to patients hospitalized with the virus.
Before long, however, cracks started appearing in the study—and in Surgisphere itself. Scientists and journalists noted that the Lancet paper’s data included impossibly high numbers of cases—exceeding official case or death counts for some continents and coming implausibly close for others. Similar data discrepancies were also identified in two previous studies that had relied on the company’s database. Inquiries by The Scientist and The Guardian, meanwhile, failed to identify any hospital that had contributed to the registry.
See The Scientist’s investigation into Surgisphere Corporation
It also emerged that, for a company claiming to have created one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated patient databases, Surgisphere had little in the way of medical research to show for it. Founded by vascular surgeon Sapan Desai in 2008 and employing only a handful of people at a time, the company initially produced textbooks aimed at medical students. It later dabbled in various projects, including a short-lived medical journal, before shooting to fame this year with its high-profile publications on health outcomes in COVID-19 patients. 
The provenance of Surgisphere’s database—if it even exists, which many clinicians, journal editors, and researchers have questioned—has yet to become clear. Most of Desai’s coauthors admitted to having only seen summary data, and independent auditors tasked with verifying the database’s validity were never granted access, leading to the June 4 retractions of the Lancet study and a previous paper based on the database in The New England Journal of Medicine. Over the following days, The Scientist and other media outlets pointed out inaccurate claims made on Surgisphere’s website, which it had launched in February and gradually erased as accusations of fraud mounted. Desai, who spoke to The Scientist at the end of May, is no longer responding to requests for comment.
Despite the brevity of Surgisphere’s moment in the limelight, the repercussions of the company’s actions have been far-reaching. While the WHO quickly resumed hydroxychloroquine testing following criticisms of the Lancet paper, at least one international trial was delayed more than a month. A now-removed preprint of one of the company’s earlier studies, which linked the antiparasitic medicine ivermectin to better survival in COVID-19 patients, was used by national and regional governments in Latin America to help justify including the drug in clinical guidelines for disease treatment and prevention—decisions that have not been reversed since the paper disappeared. A nonprofit organization in Africa that had partnered with Surgisphere to develop diagnostic tools for COVID-19 watched months of work disintegrate after the company and its database fell into disrepute.
Despite the brevity of Surgisphere’s moment in the limelight, the repercussions of the company’s actions have been far-reaching.
As the initial shock faded, the medical and scientific communities sought to make sense of how something so damaging could have happened so quickly—and whether it could be prevented from happening again. While a heightened sense of urgency during the pandemic undoubtedly contributed to the problem, there were many people and institutions that theoretically could have prevented Surgisphere’s effects on science and public health, notes Rachel Cooper, the director of the Health Initiative at the nonprofit organization Transparency International.
Desai’s astonishing influence on COVID-19 policy was dependent on multiple parties, Cooper notes, from the institutions that employed him to the coauthors on his research studies, the journals that published the work, and the organizations that issued public health decisions based on his research. Seen that way, the scandal represents “a perfect storm of issues that have always been there,” she says. 
An investigation by The Scientist points to a series of missed opportunities to halt Surgisphere’s progress—in some cases stemming from people’s failure to check implausible claims made by Desai or from a pattern of ignoring warnings of problematic data or behavior. While a few parties have since accepted some responsibility and outlined plans to avoid similar situations in the future, the majority have not. 
Desai’s medical career went largely unchecked
From the time he founded Surgisphere in 2008 as a surgical resident at Duke University, Desai spent 12 years working as a vascular surgeon in various US states. The Scientist learned of serious concerns about Desai’s integrity and his conduct as a physician spanning that time. 
After he left Duke in 2012, Desai trained or worked at the University of Texas Health Science Center, Southern Illinois University (SIU), and Northwest Community Hospital (NCH) in suburban Chicago. At the latter two institutions, he held senior positions: director of a new surgical skills lab and vice chair of research for surgery at SIU, and director of performance improvement at NCH, which he joined in 2016.
While vascular surgery was not the focus of Surgisphere’s work during the pandemic, Desai emphasized his background as a doctor in press materials and interviews, calling the company “physician-led.” The Scientist has since spoken to five of Desai’s former colleagues—ranging from medical trainees to supervisors—spanning his medical career.  
The colleagues, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions, recount similar concerns about Desai during the time they had worked with him. All five describe experiences of Desai making exaggerated claims about his personal achievements, and three people at two separate institutions say they had firsthand experiences of Desai providing inaccurate information about patients. They accuse him of describing patient data that didn’t match patient charts, for example, or saying he’d attended to a patient when nurses and other staff confirmed he hadn’t. Those three also indicate that Desai’s unreliability was an open secret, with staff members regularly checking the veracity of his claims with other members of the institution.  
Asked why concerns about Desai’s conduct hadn’t been followed up on, some former colleagues say they’d felt too junior or hadn’t had enough proof to make a formal complaint. Others reference the risk of Desai pursuing legal action, or of retaliation from their institutions, which might have suffered reputational damage should those concerns be made public. Some say complaints were made internally at their institutions, but weren’t acted upon.
By the time Desai left NCH this February, he’d been accused of medical malpractice in at least three lawsuits—two of which involved permanent damage following surgery and one that involved a patient death. Those cases are ongoing and Desai told The Scientist earlier this year that he deemed any lawsuit naming him to be unfounded.
Contacted by The Scientist, most people in charge of departments where Desai worked declined to comment. NCH, which continued to list Desai in its online physician directory until June, tells The Scientist in a statement that Desai had left voluntarily for “personal reasons.” Desai, who is still registered with the American Board of Surgery and has an active medical license in Illinois, told The Scientist in May that he would consider returning to clinical practice in the future, although his former colleagues say that after what’s happened he’d be unlikely to find a job in vascular surgery at a major institution. 
Coauthors helped Surgisphere publish dodgy COVID-19 research
Surgisphere went through many guises and was repeatedly reregistered in different states as Desai moved from institution to institution during his medical career. Only in the last couple of years did the company begin redefining itself as a data analytics firm. It was in this capacity that Surgisphere would soon claim it had amassed a medical database of almost unprecedented proportions and complexity, one that could offer crucial insights during this year’s pandemic.
By the time of the Lancet publication, Surgisphere had provided data for two other studies of COVID-19 patients. The first, posted as a preprint on SSRN in early April, linked ivermectin to improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The second, published on May 1 in NEJM, reported an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 patient mortality, but no elevated risk associated with certain heart drugs feared to be harmful in patients hospitalized with the virus. For the three studies, Desai had collaborated with various combinations of six other people—five who would later say they had not seen the raw data on which the studies were based, and three who received (but didn’t act upon) warnings from other researchers about possible problems with Surgisphere’s data. 
All the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data provided.
—Statement included with the retracted article
in The New England Journal of Medicine 
Weeks before the Lancet study was published, data scientist Joe Brew and medical researcher Carlos Chaccour—both of whom are involved in a clinical trial at ISGlobal in Barcelona testing ivermectin’s use to reduce COVID-19 transmission—wrote to Desai and his preprint coauthors, Mandeep Mehra of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, David Grainger of the University of Utah, and Amit Patel, who formerly held a teaching post at Utah, about discrepancies in the ivermectin data. These discrepancies were similar to those that would later be raised for the Lancet paper—specifically, there appeared to be more cases in the Surgisphere dataset than official records captured, suspiciously high numbers of hospitalizations on continents where electronic medical records are rarely used, and surprisingly large effect sizes given what was known of the drugs in question. 
Mehra—who, along with Patel, would coauthor all three Surgisphere studies—responded to Brew and Chaccour that he shared doubts about the “implausibly high” effect size and forwarded their concerns to Desai and Patel. Desai also replied but did not assuage the researchers’ concerns, Brew and Chaccour tell The Scientist. 
Asked about the exchange, Grainger tells The Scientist in a statement that Mehra handled all the correspondence about data sourcing and that he’d never been in contact with Surgisphere. Mehra tells The Scientist in a statement that he wasn’t aware of potential discrepancies in the dataset before the Lancet paper was published, and that all correspondence on the preprint should be directed to first author Patel. Patel, who the Lancet study stated had “full access to all the data in the study” and who revealed on Twitter that he is related to Desai “by marriage,” did not reply to specific questions by The Scientist on this issue. 
Desai’s remaining three collaborators, like Grainger, each worked on only one paper. Frank Ruschitzka of University Hospital Zurich, a coauthor on the Lancet study, says in a statement that Mehra had recruited him at the “manuscript stage in this Harvard-led registry analysis” and that he had no role in data acquisition. 
The Scientist also contacted authors of the NEJM paper, which included the statement that “all the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data provided.” SreyRam Kuy did not respond, and her institution, Baylor College of Medicine, tells The Scientist that she is unavailable for comment. Timothy Henry of Christ Hospital in Cincinnati acknowledges he hadn’t seen Surgisphere’s data when the team submitted the NEJM paper, but tells The Scientist in an interview that it’s common practice for coauthors on clinical research to review only summary data, and that there was nothing suspicious about Surgisphere’s dataset at the time. He says he doesn’t believe the data were fabricated and that he thinks NEJM retracted the paper too quickly, adding that the paper’s conclusions have since been “proven to be correct,” suggesting that the problems lie with the data source rather than “data accuracy.”
The scientific community is often unclear on how to treat the coauthors of researchers accused of fraud or other misconduct, says Stefan Eriksson, who directs the Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics at Uppsala University in Sweden. But the situation is more black-and-white for authors who formally vouch for a published study, as all five NEJM authors did and as Patel did on the Lancet paper. “You can’t escape your responsibility” in this case, Eriksson says. By assuring journals of the veracity of the dataset without having taken the necessary steps to confirm it, a researcher has effectively “betrayed the publishing culture, and science in a sense, as much as if you were part in the making up of data.”
The University of Utah terminated Patel’s employment as an unpaid adjunct member of faculty in early June. Asked whether Mehra was under investigation, Harvard Medical School tells The Scientist that it is “fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of our research. Any concerns brought to our attention are reviewed thoroughly in accordance with our institutional policies and applicable regulations.”

Peer review missed major problems with Surgisphere’s dataset
In the 13 days between publication and retraction of the hydroxychloroquine study, The Lancet faced intense criticism—initially for allowing the paper to remain online after flaws were uncovered in the database, and later for having allowed the paper to be published at all.
Many scientists, including Brew and Chaccour, wrote to the journal within days of the paper’s publication highlighting concerns about the patient numbers and the formidable challenges of collecting high-quality electronic medical data from hundreds of hospitals in such a short time. Those concerns were also discussed by researchers in blog posts and on PubPeer. On May 28, statistician James Watson of the Bangkok-based Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), which was involved in one of the hydroxychloroquine trials suspended following the paper’s publication, posted an open letter to the journal and the study authors on behalf of more than 100 signatories, listing 10 major concerns about the study’s methods and data. (He later organized a second letter listing concerns about the NEJM study.)
On May 30, The Lancet issued a brief correction, in which the authors revised data from Australia—where the paper’s recorded deaths had exceeded official counts—and modified one of the paper’s supplementary data tables. The Lancet told The Scientist in an emailed statement that the study’s conclusions were unchanged. But on June 2, both The Lancet and NEJM published expressions of concern, and just two days later, after independent auditors failed to obtain access to Surgisphere’s dataset, both of the studies were retracted. 
Some scientists expressed frustration that the journals didn’t act sooner; Watson wrote in an email to The Scientist at the end of May that “by allowing the authors to post [a] correction and not address any of the other concerns, The Lancet appear to [be] stating that so far they are not worried about the reliability of the study.” 
Editor-in-chief Richard Horton has repeatedly defended the journal’s actions, telling The Scientist that editors followed proper editorial processes and that the journal acted swiftly to evaluate and then retract the paper. As for whether The Lancet should have prevented Surgisphere’s work from being published at all, he notes that “peer review is not an effective system for detecting fraud,” because editors and reviewers typically trust that they’re reviewing genuine research. He denied that hype around hydroxychloroquine had unduly influenced the editorial process for this study. 
The Lancet and NEJM have both said that they’ll aim to improve paper acceptance procedures. “We strive not to repeat mistakes,” NEJM tells The Scientist in a statement. “As occurs with every retraction, we make changes to our system, test them, then reevaluate to see if they’re having an impact.” For example, the journal plans to include reviewers with better expertise in “big data” for similar studies in the future, a NEJM spokesperson tells The Guardian.
At The Lancet, part of the response will entail including questions about possible breaches of research integrity as part of peer review, Horton says, as well as asking authors more-specific questions about the data’s accuracy and reliability. “You’re trying to tack between learning the lessons but also not overresponding, because you don’t want to impose another layer of bureaucracy on science that actually makes it more difficult either to do science or to publish science,” Horton says. “You’re trying to minimize harm and maximize the efficiency of the system—that’s a very difficult balance.” [Update: After the print version of this article went to press, The Lancet announced these changes and more in a published comment.]  
Regulatory agencies reacted swiftly to observational research
The Lancet study had rapid, widespread effects, partly due to the dramatic responses of organizations overseeing hydroxychloroquine research. Within hours of its publication on May 22, the head of MHRA’s clinical trials unit, Martin O’Kane, wrote to organizers of COPCOV—a large international trial investigating hydroxychloroquine and the related molecule chloroquine as a preventive therapy for health workers exposed to COVID-19—saying that trial organizers were expected to “immediately cease recruitment.” Three days later, the WHO publicly announced it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity Trial, which was testing several potential treatments for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in light of the safety concerns.
The Lancet study had rapid, widespread effects, partly due to the dramatic responses of organizations overseeing hydroxychloroquine research.
Although both organizations responded quickly to the Lancet study’s publication, the WHO was swifter to react as concerns about the paper were raised. On June 3, after The Lancet issued an expression of concern but before the paper’s retraction, the agency reinstated recruitment to the hydroxychloroquine arm after finding “no reasons to modify the trial protocol,” the WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at the time. The study would subsequently conclude that the drug was ineffective in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; citing interim data, the WHO dropped the hydroxychloroquine arm for good on June 17. By then, another large study, the UK RECOVERY trial—which had continued testing hydroxychloroquine in late May and early June—had reported similar findings. The WHO did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
The COPCOV trial was plagued by greater delays, despite pleas from the research community. Scientists running COPCOV had responded to MHRA’s May 22 communication with pages of documents explaining why the trial shouldn’t be suspended, why the Lancet study was flawed, and how organizers could implement additional safety precautions. Nevertheless, MHRA proceeded with a formal suspension of the trial on June 8, days after the Lancet paper had been retracted. It wasn’t until June 26, more than a week after MHRA received the trial organizers’ formal response to the June 8 suspension, that the agency allowed COPCOV to resume. By then, other studies had been published on the issue, including a small trial from researchers at the University of Minnesota that reported on June 3 that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective as postexposure prophylaxis, although it hadn’t detected any safety issues.
COPCOV organizers note that the five-week delay—not to mention the decrease in active cases and the negative public opinion about hydroxychloroquine that developed in the interim—may have permanently hobbled the trial. MORU’s Nick White, COPCOV’s co-principal investigator, says he was surprised at MHRA’s lightning fast action to suspend research on hydroxychloroquine as a preventive therapy based on observational findings in hospitalized patients. The agency “didn’t follow their normal principles,” White says. Noting similarly dramatic responses to the Lancet study by regulators in other countries, he adds, “I think they all bent under the intense political pressure and the natural media hype.”
MHRA defended its decisions in a statement to The Scientist. “When presented with a body of evidence—even after retraction of the Lancet paper—that represented a fine balance between the potential risks and potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine, MHRA rightly made regulatory decisions [with participant protection] as our prime concern.” It added that “the situation surrounding the publication and subsequent retraction of the Lancet study . . . is unfortunate, and there will be lessons learnt across the research system.” It did not provide further detail about what those lessons were or whether the agency would be implementing any new measures.
A legacy for science and public health?
Many questions about Surgisphere have yet to be answered, such as how the company’s data were assembled and what motivated Desai, who has not admitted to wrongdoing, to produce the studies in the first place. Now that public interest in the company has subsided, with debates on other scientific and political issues taking center stage, those questions may never be answered. Some scientists have since argued that some amount of flawed research is an inevitable, even acceptable, price to pay for the accelerated pace of science during the pandemic. Others have argued the opposite, saying that what’s needed right now is more-rigorous science and science-based decision making—an opinion echoed in a July editorial in The Lancet Global Health.
For the people directly affected by Surgisphere’s actions, the discussion is far from academic. In July, Lee Wallis of the African Federation for Emergency Medicine, the nonprofit that partnered with Surgisphere to develop COVID-19 diagnostic aids for clinicians in low-resource settings, told The Scientist the organization’s work had been delayed by at least six months, a cost that would be felt by African patients. Meanwhile, Patricia García, a Solidarity Trial investigator and the former health minister of Peru—one of the countries in which the ivermectin preprint has been widely cited in recommendations for COVID-19 treatment—expressed anger that Surgisphere had been able to damage public trust in scientists at a time when scientific expertise is needed most.
“Now people are so confused about what science can give you—whether hydroxychloroquine works, it doesn’t work, it’s fake, it’s not fake—that it’s going to be very difficult for us scientists then to use any type of article or publication,” says García. “Now that they know scientists can lie, who will believe us again?” 
Opinion: Scientists Must Battle the Disinformation Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FEODORA CHIOSEA
A
s COVID-19 wreaks havoc across the world, scientists are making unparalleled, heroic strides to discover the virus’s biology and vulnerabilities. We have learned far more about SARS-CoV-2 than we knew about any pandemic-sparking pathogen in human history within a year of its emergence, and experts are working tirelessly to publicly share this information. These efforts should be bolstered and carefully considered by federal governments to save lives and stem the tide of contagion. In the US, however, the Trump administration has censored scientists, diminished the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s role in leading the pandemic response, politicized tracking and storage of health data, and attempted to undermine the credibility of its own researchers. 
A government actively silencing scientific voices has collided with a shrinking independent news environment and growing dependence upon social media for information. This has meant that there is a dearth of clear, science-based guidance—and in that void, both intentionally false information (disinformation) and unintentionally misleading information (misinformation) proliferate. As COVID-19 continues to claim lives, some US political leaders and pundits are spreading disinformation to understate the pandemic’s severity, discredit public health experts’ advice on preventive social distancing measures, and sow distrust of government data. The World Health Organization has defined this landscape as an “infodemic:” “an over-abundance of information—some accurate and some not—that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.”
Acceptance of disinformation can result in a cascade of dangerous events, such as consumers ingesting a form of chloroquine, government shelving important scientific work, scientists facing serious harassment, and the loss of public trust in the government as a source of science-backed advice, which is crucial to help keep us safe now and during future national crises. 
That’s why scientific voices are needed, now more than ever, to cut through the noise. Here are some ways that all scientists can help arm the public with the information they need to make evidence-based decisions about their lives as COVID-19 continues to spread.
A government actively silencing scientific voices has collided with a shrinking independent news environment and growing dependence upon social media for information.
Promote science literacy. Research has shown there are partisan differences affecting trust in science and public health measures related to COVID-19, but people generally trust scientists as messengers. A 2019 Pew poll found that 86 percent of the more than 4,400 Americans surveyed had a great deal or fair amount of confidence in scientists. The coronavirus pandemic presents an opportunity for scientists to have conversations with friends, family, colleagues, and members of the public about scientific concepts. Wider understanding of the scientific process may lead to a fuller grasp of the time it takes to make discoveries and build knowledge about COVID-19. Likewise, it will help people understand that one study is not representative of the scientific consensus and less meaningful on its own—which is hard to hear when findings are desirable. 
Address racism head-on. For too long, the scientific community has been perpetuating racist policies and practices that have excluded people of color—continuing to honor racist scientists, making work environments hostile, and participating in racist research that perpetuates falsehoods. While trust in scientists is generally high, trust in medical scientists is lower among Black adults than among other demographics. As a result, Black adults are more skeptical than Hispanic and white adults when it comes to experimental treatments for COVID-19. Communities of color are hit harder by the virus due to systemic racist policies that have led to health inequities, so scientists have a responsibility to rebuild trust and help ensure that accurate information is heard by those who need it most. A first step in rebuilding public trust among minority populations is for the scientific community to work toward being antiracist and advocate for radical change within research institutions. Scientists should foster inclusive, diverse, and equitable work environments to better recruit, retain, and lift up people of color in STEM fields. 
Make scientific information public. Scientists conducting and publishing research have more avenues than ever to make information about their studies and data accessible to the public. Researchers can post their work on preprint servers and publish in open access journals, pitch it to science and mainstream journalists, summarize the findings in an article for diverse audiences, or share it far and wide on social media. Science agencies and research institutions have scientific integrity and media policies that protect scientists’ right to speak about their work. If this isn’t the case at your institution, advocate internally for its creation. If your scientific home does maintain these policies, hold it accountable and ensure they’re enforced. 
Inoculate the public against falsehoods with accurate information. There is so much power in accurate information communicated by experts. Quality information can help to shield the public against bad information. When confronted with false information on social media, scientists should call it out, debunk it, and cite sources so that people who engage with the post in the future will, if they look far enough, encounter the truth. Research has shown that warning people about the ways such information spreads and providing scientific facts can work to reduce the likelihood of dis- and misinformation taking hold. Scientists can also help guide others to credible sources for public health information and explain what makes a source reliable so that people seek out the right messengers as they make decisions to keep themselves and their families safe. 
Advocate for the role of independent science in decision-making. Science advocacy has grown in the wake of an unprecedented assault on federal science and scientists. Become a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Science Network or of another science advocacy organization, and join your peers showing up at virtual hearings, writing public comments, and asking local, state, and federal leaders questions about the information and experts they’re using to support their responses to COVID-19. Scientists can nominate themselves or peers to serve on federal advisory committees tackling some of the issues related to the virus to help the government make informed decisions.
One of the lessons to take away from the myriad failures of this White House in responding to the spread of COVID-19 is that sidelining scientists’ voices during a public health crisis has grave consequences. It has resulted in the needless deaths of hundreds of thousands and in countless more lives turned upside down. It has also allowed the infodemic that accompanies and exacerbates COVID-19 to take hold. It will take more than scientists to get us out of this crisis, but scientists need to make their voices heard and tackle misinformation head on. A new generation of researchers is watching and learning, inspired by the heroes they see on the frontlines and those innovating to solve one of the world’s most devastating problems. Let’s give them the tools they need to help ensure that our country never makes the same mistakes again.

Kids’ Severe COVID-19 Reaction Bears Unique Immune Signature/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, STUDIO9
F
or months now during the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors have observed a rare but consistent scenario in a small number of kids: It starts with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be mild, even asymptomatic. But weeks after the children seem to have fully recovered, they suddenly come down with symptoms that may include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. 
“They had the infection, they got through it. And then all of a sudden . . . they can have this collapse in their bodies a few weeks later,” says Alvaro Moreira, a neonatologist at the University of Texas Health San Antonio who recently coauthored a review on the condition, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). 
MIS-C is rare, and not all children who become severely ill or die from COVID-19 develop it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fewer than 1,000 cases of MIS-C have been reported so far in the US, the country hardest-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with 19 deaths. Early reports of cases of MIS-C pointed to similarities between it and Kawasaki disease, a rare condition linked to viral infections that involves inflammation in the blood vessels. But there were notable differences observed between the two, such as the fact that Kawasaki mainly affects children under five, while even teenagers have come down with MIS-C. A study published earlier this month in Cell examines the similarities and differences between MIS-C and Kawasaki, as well as immune responses to COVID-19 in children and adults, to find unique features of the new condition and clues to the immune missteps that bring it about.
“I think that everyone has been waiting for something like this,” says Moreira of the work, which he was not involved in. “This one is the first study that I’ve really seen that is looking at pathways, signaling mechanisms. . . . It’s still premature, but it will start to tell us a little bit more about what is happening at the molecular level.”
The study team had been investigating Kawasaki disease before the pandemic, and had collected blood samples from 28 children with the condition between 2017 and 2019. They compared levels of white blood cells and proteins in those samples with those of 12 healthy children, 13 with MIS-C, and 41 with COVID-19 who did not develop MIS-C, along with 17 adults with severe COVID-19.

“One of the first things that happened when these kids [with MIS-C] started coming into the hospital was that people said, ‘Well, maybe we should treat them the same way as we treat adults with severe disease,’” says coauthor Petter Brodin, a pediatric immunologist at the Karolinska Institute and the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden. But the study found that the inflammatory response in MIS-C is “completely different,” he adds, indicating that it should probably be treated differently. Specifically, the severe adult COVID-19 patients and MIS-C cases had much different blood levels of the cytokines used to guide the immune response, particularly interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-7—both of which are associated with, among other things, the number of infection-fighting immune cells available in the blood. Levels of both of those cytokines were higher in adults with COVID-19 than in either Kawasaki or MIS-C patients.
Brodin and his coauthors found more overlap in the profiles of MIS-C and Kawasaki disease than they did with MIS-C and severe COVID-19 in adults. MIS-C and Kawasaki both had lower overall numbers of T cells compared with healthy children. Both conditions also involved the presence of antibodies to some of the body’s own proteins, known as autoantibodies, Brodin notes. “Some of them overlapped between MIS-C and Kawasaki, and some were unique to MIS-C, and we didn’t see them in any of the other groups,” he says, which “suggests that there’s a pathological process induced by [SARS-CoV-2] that is unique to this particular virus.”
One possible explanation, he says, has to do with a phenomenon other studies have observed: that SARS-CoV-2 tamps down an early, innate immune defense cells mount to viral infections, known as the interferon response. That could lead to a scenario where, in the later adaptive immune response, T cells and antibody-producing B cells “potentially then have a less-focused response and more of a wide response that might cross react and lead to autoimmunity,” he says, adding that this has yet to be proven.
Another hypothesis, put forward in a study published yesterday in PNAS, is that a unique part of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein acts as a so-called superantigen that causes an excessive adaptive immune response. Brodin says the idea is “interesting,” but adds that in his opinion, “the evidence in the paper are not strong enough to conclude that this is the principal mechanism” in causing MIS-C.
The finding from Brodin’s Cell study that there are clear differences between the proteins found in the blood of Kawasaki and MIS-C patients jibes with what Betsy Herold, a pediatric infectious disease physician and virologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System, has seen in the clinic, she says. (Herold was not involved in the Cell study.) That finding, she says, “is very important, because I think there’s a lot of confusion out there [about], is this Kawasaki? And I think the answer is no, it has some overlap with Kawasaki, but it’s not the same thing.”
Herold, along with her spouse Kevan Herold, an immunobiologist at Yale University, recently led their own study that touched on MIS-C, although its primary aim was to ferret out differences in the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults. In that study, the cytokine responses of infected children who later went on to develop MIS-C matched those of kids who did not, leading Betsy Herold to think that both groups of patients do indeed mount an effective innate response initially. “We postulate that [the MIS-C patients] made a good innate response and that they protected their lungs from disease, and then . . . a few weeks later, when their antibody responses start kicking in, there’s something else that’s perhaps a little bit dysregulated,” she says.  But, notes Kevan Herold, “I think we still don’t have a completely clear answer” on what it is that causes some children to develop MIS-C after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while most don’t. 
The good news, says Moreira, is that “even though we still don’t completely understand a lot of the mechanistic drivers of the disease, [MIS-C patients] are responding to common therapies that we use for Kawasaki disease.” These include intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. “So they work, but I think we would feel more comfortable if we knew how, exactly, they work.”

Vast Majority in US Remain Susceptible to COVID-19: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

ewer than 10 percent of dialysis patients sampled in the US showed signs of having had COVID-19 as of late July, a sign that much of the population remains susceptible to the novel coronavirus, according to one of the largest studies of its kind published Friday (September 25) in The Lancet.
Researchers studied the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a random subset of thousands of dialysis patients across the country. Their findings do not indicate exactly how many in the US are immune to the virus, as it is unclear how long immunity lasts and not every infected individual develops antibodies.
“We are still in the middle of the fight,” Eli Rosenberg, an epidemiologist at the State University of New York at Albany who was not part of the study, tells The Washington Post. “We’re all tired, and we’re all hoping for a vaccine. This shows us how it’s not over here, not even by a long shot.”
Researchers from Stanford University and Ascend Clinical, a laboratory that processes tests for kidney dialysis patients, studied leftover blood plasma samples from 28,500 patients who underwent dialysis at any of 1,300 centers across 46 states in July. Dialysis patients undergo routine monthly laboratory studies, making it easy for researchers to gather samples.
The plasma indicated that about 8 percent had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which extrapolates to about 9 percent of all US adults, according to Stanford biostatistician and study coauthor Maria Montez-Rath, who used patient demographics to translate that result to the broader population.
Despite more than 7 million documented US coronavirus cases, the results suggest that the country is nowhere near the herd immunity threshold required to prevent large-scale resurgences of the virus. Researchers have not yet determined the ideal number of the populace that would need immunity, but some epidemiologists have estimated it to be upward of 75 percent, Shweta Bansal, a Georgetown University epidemiologist, told Vox.
The study authors urged public health efforts to target interventions toward racial and ethnic minority populations, as those groups had a disproportionate incidence of coronavirus antibodies: 16 percent of those who live in majority Black and Hispanic communities, 11 percent of participants who live in majority Hispanic communities, and 4 percent of patients from majority white communities.
Infectious disease doctor Barnaby Flower and public health expert Christina Atchison, Imperial College London researchers who were not involved with the study, describe in an accompanying comment in The Lancet the limitations of studying only dialysis patients.
“Attending a health-care facility three times a week would seem like a good way to encounter SARS-CoV-2, as has been shown elsewhere,” they write, which would mean researchers overestimated the population with antibodies. But, they also concede that the authors could have undercounted, as patients who require dialysis are more likely to die of the virus and, therefore, would be excluded from the study.
COVID-19 Ushers in the Future of Conferences/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

he Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology had planned to hold a joint conference this August in Heidelberg, Germany. But by the time spring rolled around, and the pandemic took firm hold of global travel, that was looking less and less likely. On May 9, the organizers postponed the in-person meeting until 2021. Amber Smith, a mathematical biologist at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, and her fellow conference organizers stepped in to put together a virtual conference to give researchers a chance to share the research still advancing worldwide.
“We were really trying to have a meeting that was as close to an in-person meeting as we could possibly have,” Smith tells The Scientist. They found Sococo, a platform that allows users to create an online building. The organizers worked closely with virtual event coordinators at MathDept.org to design the Sococo virtual space so it would provide for socializing, networking, and mentoring, as well as hearing talks, seeing posters, and visiting the meeting’s corporate sponsors.
The goal, according to Smith, was to build an experience that was more than sitting on a Zoom call watching talk after talk. Participants, represented by little colored dots, entered a room by clicking on it and socialized using a feature that finds and pings colleagues for a video chat within the Sococo platform. Via Zoom and webinar integration, all the people in a virtual presentation space attended the same talks and could ask questions by chat, audio, or video.
“We got a ton of feedback from people saying that they absolutely loved it,” Smith says. Plus, the roughly 1,800 attendees represented more than 90 different countries—two to three times as many as at previous in-person Society for Mathematical Biology meetings. The organizers plan to incorporate some virtual components into future conferences, even post-pandemic, she adds.
If we could do it for coronavirus, then we can do it for the climate crisis, too.

Plenty of meetings have gone virtual—or been canceled all together—since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Proponents of online conferences point to reduced carbon emissions and increased accessibility as they make the case for making many of the pandemic-induced changes to meetings permanent. It remains to be seen whether connections made online will support science in the same way as those made in person, but researchers around the world are trying out strategies to make virtual interactions a success.
Online benefits
Even before the pandemic forced the issue, scientists had been thinking about ways to reduce their carbon footprints, often by cutting back on air travel.
Between the record number of hurricanes in the Atlantic and fires in the western US, “there is an urgent climate emergency,” Abraham Palmer, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, tells The Scientist. He and Chloe Jordan of the National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote an editorial published on September 16 touting the climate benefits of virtual meetings and exhorting scientists to act. In a comment published August 13, Palmer and Jordan describe how well an online planning meeting for the annual American College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference worked, while detailing the high cost—both in finances and CO2 emissions—of flying everyone to previous planning sessions.

Meeting online, whether it’s for a conference, study section, or worldwide lab gathering, works better than people expect, and it’s more convenient and economical, Palmer says. When colleagues talk about missing the in-person stuff—dinners, drinks, and chance meetings when sharing a cab to or from an airport—he reminds them of the climate, financial, and time burden of all of those things that they’re missing and of the benefits of changing things up. 
“I really do hope that we’re going to look back in five or ten years and this will really have been a turning point where a lot of the things that we had leading up to COVID are never going to get rebuilt the same way they were,” he says. “If we could do it for coronavirus, then we can do it for the climate crisis, too.”
Another benefit of meeting virtually is how many more people can access the conferences. Researchers with caregiving responsibilities, disabilities, travel restrictions, scheduling conflicts, or limited funds are more likely to be able to attend a meeting online, says Sarvenaz Sarabipour, a computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University. She and an international group of other early-career researchers posted a preprint on bioRxiv in April in which they curated a database of more than 270 past in-person conferences across scientific disciplines and evaluated them for inclusivity and sustainability.
They found that nearly 860,000 people spent more than $1.288 billion and generated upwards of 2 million tons of CO2 attending these conferences between 2016 and 2020. And for the most part, the gatherings had no public diversity or gender equity policies and didn’t offer childcare or formal accommodations for nursing a baby. The authors propose several alternatives, including taking things online and putting emphasis on regional conferences or coordinating several hubs of one larger conference, so less air travel would be required to attend, an idea that Palmer favors as well.
One of the main objections that people make to virtual meetings is the loss of networking time, especially for early-career researchers looking for jobs. That criticism is unfounded, according to Sarabipour, who says that the websites of scientific journals, Twitter, and, more recently, massive Slack communities of early-career scientists have been more consistent sources for jobseekers than once-yearly scientific meetings. And despite the objections, the widespread adoption of online interactions during the pandemic “begs the question of why we had to get to this point to do something this good.” Sarabipour says.
The future is now 
Even before the pandemic, some researchers were working on making meetings better. Last summer, Dan Goodman, a computational neuroscientist at Imperial College London, was involved in discussions with various colleagues about how to reduce the climate impact of conferences. “People were saying we should make them online, and I was very skeptical of that, because I understood that the point of conferences is not just to look at the talks, it’s to meet people and to make new connections,” he tells The Scientist. “I wasn’t really convinced that it would work” online.
One of the main objections that people make to virtual meetings is the loss of networking time, especially for early-career researchers looking for jobs.
Then, in September 2019, Goodman headed to the Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where he participated in a so-called mind matching session. Participants provided three abstracts representative of their research and were matched by an algorithm with up to six other scientists, with whom they had 15-minute conversations.
“My mind was absolutely blown by it, because I sat down, and I met six people that I’d never met before. Two of them were working on exactly the same problem that I was working on, and I’d never heard of them,” Goodman says. “I thought, ‘Okay, if you have something as powerful as this, maybe you can get rid of in-person conferences because you can replace that social element, which is the point of the whole thing.’”
Goodman got in touch with University of Pennsylvania computational neuroscientist Konrad Kording and Titipat Achakulvisut, a graduate student in Kording’s group who led the development of the algorithm behind the mind matching. It works by analyzing the text supplied by each person, as well as people they already know and people they hope to meet, and using those analyses to create a matrix of compatibility from which they pull possible matches. They use a similar strategy for matching jobseekers with job listings at meetings.
Along with some other colleagues, Goodman, Kording, and Achakulvisut started to plan an online computational neuroscience “unconference” called neuromatch that, in addition to having live talks via Crowdcast, would offer attendees six suggestions of people to speak to. When things started to shut down due to COVID-19, they quickly planned to hold the first neuromatch in March. It was free, and 3,000 people attended.
In a point-of-view published in eLife in April, the organizers explain their strategies for running the online unconference. In May, they held neuromatch 2.0, also attended by about 3,000 people, and they’re planning neuromatch 3.0 for October. For the first time, at neuromatch 3.0, the organizers are charging a $25 registration fee that anyone can waive, no questions asked, and have opened the unconference to all neuroscientists, not just those interested in computational neuro.
Achakulvisut predicts that both online and in-person conferences will exist in the future, but that many neuromatch attendees will probably keep coming to online conferences. “We have people from all over the world that typically can’t show up” if the conference is somewhere hard to get to—because of visa restrictions, distance, expense, or something else.
See “As Visa Difficulties Persist, Scientists Push for Change”
The sort of reach that a conference like neuromatch offers is just the beginning of what Mike Morrison, a web developer–turned–Michigan State University PhD student in work psychology, would like to see for science. In a commentary published September 3, he and his coauthors propose that scientific conferences, especially now that so many are taking place virtually, could be venues to update the whole world about the progress of science, not just the attendees.
Making all conference products—talks, posters, and abstracts—available as YouTube videos, images via FigShare, and preprints, they argue, could be a way to accelerate the pace of discovery by reaching everyone who might possibly contribute. Conference administrators want this bigger impact for their attendees, Morrison says. “I’m really looking forward to hearing from a scientific conference to see if they want to try it.”
Another democratizing strategy Morrison and colleagues propose is the #TwitterPoster, a three–to–five–slide PowerPoint presentation optimized to be shared as a GIF on Twitter—a tool that could also work in poster sessions at virtual meetings. Sharing information in this flipbook-like style was so successful for a group of psychology grad students at University College Dublin earlier this year that their hashtag #GIFsFromYourGaff started trending.

“On the internet, it is the nature of content to be freely available, spread widely, and permanent,” Morrison tells The Scientist. “In science, our content is still locked-down, kept to ourselves, and—especially in the case of conference content—ephemeral. What I want for the future is for science to close the gap with modern publishing methods, so it can be as available and easy to access as the rest of humanity’s content.”
Effectiveness: to be determined
The Transforming Vaccinology meeting originally planned for March was canceled, but the organizers and facilitating nonprofit Keystone Symposia regrouped to offer a COVID-19–specific vaccinology conference online in June. In the context of a pandemic, it was perhaps even more critical to have so many researchers—including keynote speaker Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—able to come together and trade ideas. 
The meeting “got tremendous interest, and a lot of unpublished data was shared,” says Thale Jarvis, Keystone Symposia’s chief scientific officer. “The organizers commented on the amazing . . . democratization of the access to science.”
Participants from more than 60 countries engaged in extensive Q&A sessions with speakers via chat and video, and session moderators moved unanswered questions over to the public forum for further discussion. “We have a variety of different ways that we try to try to connect people and, obviously, it’s never going to quite replicate those random interactions that happen at a face-to-face meeting, where you strike up a conversation on the way over to breakfast and end up discovering you have something in common scientifically,” she says, “but the sort of kneejerk reaction that because it’s a virtual format it won’t give a satisfying outcome is a bit unfair.”
Especially for innovators, being physically close at some point is, as far as the research indicates, pretty important.
—Maria Roche, Harvard Business School
Since early in the pandemic, Gautam Dey, a postdoc at University College London, has co-organized an online seminar series called pombeTalks that draws around 150 fission yeast researchers to Zoom every other week. He and organizers of other virtual seminar series published a perspective in the Journal of Cell Science on August 1, giving tips for starting and supporting such a community. 
“The online formats, whether it’s a virtual conference format or a seminar series format, are extremely good at broadly disseminating information . . . and to make that as inclusive and effectively carbon neutral as possible,” he says. “But the thing that I anecdotally observe in those interactions is that they are, with some exceptions, built upon preexisting, real-world relationships between people that have built up over years,” he adds. “To me, it seems very difficult to de novo generate new scientific connections between people through these virtual formats, whatever they are.”
Dey’s concern is neither uncommon nor unfounded. Maria Roche, who studies knowledge production and innovation at Harvard Business School, tells The Scientist that studies have shown that colocation—even temporary colocation at an in-person conference—can have an effect on the rate and quality of scientific collaborations. “Especially for innovators, being physically close at some point is, as far as the research indicates, pretty important,” she says.
Psychologist Anne Frenzel and chronobiologist Martha Merrow, both of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, have collaborated to study participant experiences in virtual conferences created to reduce carbon emissions. In the first iteration, some participants gathered at regional hubs to cut down on travel and others participated fully online.
The researchers have been exploring “whether conference participants experience different levels of subjective satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs of relatedness (feeling connected with the other conference attendees), competence (feeling capable, effective, and proficient), and autonomy (having a sense of choice) when attending virtual versus live conferences,” Frenzel writes in an email to The Scientist. “The relatedness factor seems the one which is most at stake with virtual formats.”
According to Frenzel, preliminary and “poorly statistically powered” analyses so far indicate “that virtual attendance, as compared to live attendance at the hubs, did not substantially affect psychological experiences of basic need satisfaction.” But she cautions that she is reluctant to interpret those findings in a way that suggests virtual conferences work just as well as live conferences from a psychological perspective. Psychological research addressing the impact of digitally-based versus in-person interaction is fairly limited, she adds, but this “striking research gap . . . is certainly currently being addressed in many ongoing projects inspired by the COVID crisis.”
Autopsies Show Varied Forms of Heart Damage in COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PAUL CAMPBELL
M
assachusetts General Hospital pathologist James Stone can tell that most of the hearts he’s examined from COVID-19 patients are damaged from the first moment he holds them. They’re enlarged. They’re heavy. They’re uneven.
What he can’t tell—at least until he starts looking at samples of the tissue under a microscope—is exactly how those hearts were damaged, and whether it is a direct result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Early in the pandemic, other clinicians noted that even some patients who didn’t have preexisting heart conditions experienced cardiovascular damage while fighting COVID-19 infections, pointing to a possible causative link. Researchers had found, for example, that 8–12 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of muscle contraction–regulating proteins called troponins—a sign of heart damage—and that these patients had an increased risk of mortality compared with those who didn’t have excess troponins. And early observations of patients in China who suffered reduced ejection fraction—the amount of blood getting pumped out of the heart each time it contracts—led researchers to suggest that these individuals were likely experiencing myocarditis, a severe form of inflammation that can weaken the heart and is commonly associated with infections.
But Stone and his collaborators’ analysis of heart tissue from 21 patients who died of COVID-19, published today (September 24) in the European Heart Journal, shows that while 86 percent of the patients did have inflammation in their hearts, only three had myocarditis. Several had other forms of heart injury, such as right ventricular strain injuries.
“The problem we identified in this study is that there’s other types of myocardial injury in these patients that is also causing elevated troponins,” says Stone. His international team sought to determine the mechanisms through which the disease damaged the heart and found that some conditions “really haven’t been talked about at all in the [COVID-19] papers that have previously been published.”
The pathologists observed a median of 20 slides from each heart, which is more than are included in most other studies regarding COVID-19’s cardiac effects. George Abela, a cardiologist at Michigan State University who was not involved in the study, tells The Scientist in an email, “This provides a more in-depth view of the extent of injury.”
The researchers expected to find some macrophages, a type of white blood cell that indicates inflammation, as pathologists had observed macrophages in the hearts of SARS patients during the 2003 outbreak. But Stone says he was surprised to see just how common these were—18 out of 21 COVID-19 patients’ hearts harbored macrophages that exhibited this type of inflammation. “It was really quite extensive,” he says.
As they analyzed the hearts further, the pathologists noted that only three patients had myocarditis, while four showed signs of heart injury due to right ventricular strain and another four had small blood clots in the vessels in the heart. It’s not clear why patients experience such inconsistent cardiac issues.
Abela says these findings have implications for treatment. For example, if the patient has right heart failure, a condition where the right side of a patient’s heart is not pumping enough blood to the lungs, a device that mechanically helps the heart pump blood might help, rather than drugs that target the inflammation or infection, which could be used to treat myocarditis.
Because so many of the hearts were infiltrated by macrophages, the researchers say that it may be difficult to discern who is experiencing myocarditis, which is characterized by different inflammatory cells—lymphocytes—while patients are alive. The two cell types would appear similar on tests that image the hearts of living patients. So, the team looked back at the patients’ medical records to see if they could find patterns in clinical tests that would reveal the type of heart damage when it still might be treatable. The three patients with myocarditis all had both troponin levels above 60 ng/mL and abnormal ECG readings while in the hospital. Only 15 percent of the patients without myocarditis had this combination.
The findings need to be replicated in larger groups of patients but could help doctors determine the best course of treatment for heart damage due to COVID-19, Stone says. The study is “giving the cardiologists and the ICU doctors that are taking care of these patients a roadmap of the changes that are going on in the heart.”
“Novel disease entities like SARS-CoV-2 reinforce the tremendous importance of continuing our efforts at continuing to facilitate autopsy evaluations,” says Allan Jaffe, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, in an email. “This consortium of hospitals have added substantially to our knowledge of Covid disease.”

Pandemic Shutdown Altered Bay Area Birdsongs/-/ABOVE: Male white-crowned sparrow in San Francisco
JN PHILLIPS
W
ith less traffic and fewer people on the streets of San Francisco this spring, the songs of resident male white-crowned sparrows became more audible despite actually being quieter, according to a report in Science today (September 24). The birds also increased in the bandwidth of their songs to include lower notes, which, according to experts, makes them more appealing to the females of the species.
“It’s a very nice paper,” says Hans Slabbekoorn, who studies the effects of noise on animal behavior at Leiden University and was not involved in the research. “The data are very convincing that these birds adjusted immediately to the lower noise levels.”
In cities that are normally bustling, the sudden shutdown of schools, shops, restaurants, and places of work in mid-march this year virtually eliminated the buzz of traffic, construction, and people almost overnight. In the relative quiet, city dwellers started noticing how noisy the birds were.
“There has been a lot of armchair observation going on that birds and other animals are being more active and are singing louder,” says ornithologist Mike Webster of Cornell University who also was not part of the research team. “To be honest, I put that down to people being at home more and paying attention more, but what these guys have shown pretty clearly is that the birds they studied really are singing differently . . . and are responding very strongly and very quickly to all the COVID-19–induced shutdowns.”
I think there will be increased interest in minimizing our own acoustic footprint.
—Mike Webster, Cornell University 
See “With Humans Indoors, Animals Go Wild”
The “guys” to whom Webster refers are animal communication researcher Elizabeth Derryberry of the University of Tennessee and colleagues. Derryberry has been studying and comparing the songs of male white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) in the noisy urban environments and quiet rural settings around San Francisco for a number of years. The female sparrows rarely sing.
“These authors were in a perfect position because they had all this pre-pandemic, highly quantitative data,” says Jeff Podos of the University of Massachusetts who studies songbird communication and was not part of the research team. For them, he says, “a really nice opportunity presented itself from amidst the grim news of the pandemic.”
A unique opportunity it may have been, but Derryberry was initially too preoccupied to notice, she confesses. “I was at home with a two-year-old and an eight-year-old and trying to keep working . . . and to [deal with] virtual school. We all were, I think, slightly bamboozled by this [shutdown].”
It wasn’t until she saw some pictures of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge on social media that the penny dropped, she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, it’s really empty.’”
Although Derryberry was in Tennessee, unable to fly to California, Jennifer Phillips, who had studied the sparrows for her PhD with Derryberry, was nearby at California Polytechnic State University, a few hours south of San Francisco, working as a postdoc in the lab of Clinton Francis.
“Everything just lined up,” says Derryberry, and with Phillips being able to record the birds and noise levels in the same locations as the team had done years earlier, “we had this nice paired comparison.”
The team first confirmed that background sound had indeed dropped. Their recordings showed on average a 7-decibel reduction in background hum in the city, bringing the noise levels close to those of the surrounding rural area, which remained largely unchanged. “The soundscape . . . of the city was almost identical to that of the countryside during the shutdown,” Derryberry says.
The question was, what if anything had happened to the birdsong? In their earlier studies, the team had found that birds in the city sing louder and at higher frequencies than their rural counterparts, presumably to be heard over the sounds of traffic and human life. When that noise was gone, they found, the resident birds quieted too—by about 4 decibels, says Derryberry.
The wider the bandwidth, the sexier and more competitive the male.
—Elizabeth Derryberry, University of Tennessee 
Despite their softer calls, the songs were audibly clearer and thus traveled further. That’s because they hadn’t dropped in volume to the same degree as the background noise, explains Derryberry. The signal-to-noise ratio was essentially higher, which accounts for the anecdotal reports of louder birdsong during shutdown.
In addition to being quieter, the sparrows’ shutdown songs had increased in bandwidth, says Derryberry. Specifically, they produced lower frequency notes that would ordinarily be lost in the low rumbling of traffic. Prior studies have shown that female birds find males who sing songs with greater bandwidth more attractive. “The wider the bandwidth, the sexier and more competitive the male,” Derryberry says.
Whether the altered songs this spring will influence the reproductive success of the city sparrows is unclear. Nevertheless, the study’s findings show that “natural systems can respond quickly to reductions in anthropogenic interference, in this case, noise,” says Webster, “so that’s a very positive thing.”
Even though human life and its accompanying noise is returning to cities as the restrictions have eased, there will be “increasing awareness that humans are having this effect on natural populations,” Webster says, and that nature can bounce back if such human disturbances are removed. As a result “I think there will be increased interest in minimizing our own acoustic footprint,” he says.
People might decide to work from home more often, for example, or make their next car an electric one. “People are probably interested in buying electric cars for lots of reasons . . . this is just one more positive benefit of doing something like that,” Webster says. In short, the study increases awareness of noise pollution, he says, and “awareness can lead to action.”

The Lancet Alters Editorial Practices After Surgisphere Scandal/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MORDOLFF 
T
he Lancet has announced changes to its editorial policies following the controversial publication and retraction earlier this year of a paper on COVID-19 patients treated with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine. The changes, described in an comment entitled “Learning from a retraction” last Thursday (September 17), include alterations to peer review and other paper acceptance procedures, and have prompted mixed responses from the scientific and science publishing community.
“The proposed changes are a welcome addition, and I am glad to see Lancet implementing them,” Mario Malički, co–editor-in-chief of the journal Research Integrity and Peer Review, writes in an email to The Scientist. “However, they do not answer the questions at the core of the peer review process. How is it that the Lancet’s editorial team and reviewers (including a statistical reviewer) missed what the research community saw when the paper came out, [and] how do the new proposed changes ensure that Lancet or other top journals indeed consult the best reviewers for the studies submitted to them?”
The Lancet attracted criticism in May for publishing the hydroxychloroquine paper, which was purportedly based on a huge database of electronic medical data managed by Surigsphere Corporation, a tiny Illinois-based company owned by study coauthor and vascular surgeon Sapan Desai. The paper reported a link between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and had fast and far-reaching effects on clinical research and global health policy, but fell apart under scrutiny from scientists and journalists within days of its publication. 
That paper and another study based on the same database published in The New England Journal of Medicine were retracted on June 4, after independent auditors said that they’d been unable to access and verify the company’s data. Surgisphere itself disappeared a couple weeks later amid accusations of scientific fraud, with its website going offline and Desai ceasing to respond to The Scientist’s requests for comment.

Speaking to The Scientist in the wake of the scandal this July, The Lancet’s editor-in-chief, Richard Horton, said that the journal would review its policies and aim to implement changes that would strike a balance “between learning the lessons but also not over-responding, because you don’t want to impose another layer of bureaucracy on science that actually makes it more difficult either to do science or to publish science.”
A process which reflects the capabilities of modern, on-line journals would provide a record of post-publication review and would recognize the work of external reviewers.

Among the changes announced last week are alterations to author declaration forms. “All authors will be asked to sign the author statements form to confirm they had full access to the data . . . and accept responsibility for submitting the Article for publication,” the comment reads. In the hydroxychloroquine study, only one author, Amit Patel—a physician and Desai’s relative—signed such a statement.
Authors will be required to include a data-sharing statement, too, detailing what data will be shared and when. While this was already a requirement for clinical trials, the changes make this obligatory for all research papers, and “editors will take data-sharing statements into account when making editorial decisions,” the comment says. 
The journal will also introduce “additional peer-review requirements,” including ensuring that “at least one peer reviewer is knowledgeable about the details of the dataset being reported”—for example, by recruiting a data scientist for studies with very large datasets—and explicitly asking reviewers if they have concerns regarding ethics or research integrity.
The changes are “a great first step” toward improving transparency and author responsibility in the publication process, says Daniel Kulp, the vice-chair and chair-elect of the nonprofit Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), which develops guidance for publishers. “It’s very important for [journals] to have not only a policy for correcting the literature,” he says, “but a process by which they can investigate how things happen and if there are ways of reducing the possibility of repeating errors. I’m completely in favor of that.” 
Kulp adds that while journals can’t guarantee against the publication of bad research, The Lancet’s move should help push scientific publishing toward greater openness. He says he hopes that the journal will reflect on the effects of the changes a year or so from now “to see if it’s accomplished what they wanted—and if not, then tweak it again in whatever direction they need to. These things should be dynamic.”
James Watson, a senior scientist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Thailand who in May organized an open letter listing concerns about the hydroxychloroquine study, tells The Scientist in an email that the new data-sharing statements in particular are an important change, “although Lancet are pretty late to the game,” as many other publishers already require such statements. 
He adds that “making it clear that the data sharing statement will be used by the editors to evaluate a new submission is a great incentive for people to think hard about data sharing and find clever ways of doing it.” MORU’s own study of hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 prevention in healthcare workers was suspended following The Lancet paper’s publication, although it has since been reinstated.
Like Malički, Watson and other researchers note that the changes don’t address larger, more general issues highlighted by Surgisphere’s papers, including journals’ reluctance to push authors to share data and code for published studies, and an overall lack of transparency in how papers are reviewed before and after publication.
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), infectious diseases researcher Matthew Spinelli, for example, tells The Scientist in an email that he is particularly disappointed by “the lack of acknowledgement of post-publication review,” without which, he adds, “this fraud would never have been detected.”
Spinelli and UCSF biostatistician David Glidden were among many scientists to write letters to The Lancet with concerns about the paper within days of its publication. Despite accepting several of those letters, The Lancet dropped plans to publish them after retracting the original paper, with Lancet senior editor Josefine Gibson writing to authors that, “in the light of the retraction, the Editor in Chief and I no longer feel that we can offer a platform for these questions and discussion.” 
Spinelli and Glidden tell The Scientist that journals should put more emphasis on the conversation that takes place after a paper is published. “A process which reflects the capabilities of modern, on-line journals would provide a record of post-publication review and would recognize the work of external reviewers,” Spinelli writes. “This process would be more accountable, fairer, and more transparent.” 
The New England Journal of Medicine wrote in a statement to The Scientist in July that it would also be reflecting on its editorial procedures in light of its own Surgisphere retraction, but has so far declined to provide detail about specific changes. 
Algorithm Spots COVID-19 Cases from Eye Images: Preprint/-/ABOVE: Eye regions analyzed by the AI-based tool for screening potential coronavirus infections
YANWEI FU
S
cientists describe a potential screening method for COVID-19 based on eye images analyzed by artificial intelligence. Scanning a set of images from several hundred individuals with and without COVID-19, the tool accurately diagnosed coronavirus infections more than 90 percent of the time, the developers reported in a preprint posted to medRxiv September 10.
“Our model is quite fast,” Yanwei Fu, a computer scientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, who led the study, tells The Scientist. “In less than a second it can check results.”
Currently, screening for coronavirus infection involves CT imaging of the lungs or analyzing samples from the nose or throat, both of which take time and require professional effort. A system based on a few images of the eyes that could triage or even diagnose people would save on both costs and time, says Fu. But the investigation by Fu’s team is preliminary and both ophthalmologists and AI specialists say they’d want to see much more information on the technique—and its performance—before being convinced it could work.
Volunteers at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre in Fudan each had five photos of their eyes taken using common CCD or CMOS cameras. Of 303 patients, 104 had COVID-19, 131 had other pulmonary conditions, and 68 had eye diseases. A neural network tool extracted and quantified the features from different regions of the eye and an algorithm recognized the ocular characteristics of each disease. A neural network is a series of algorithms for solving AI problems, learning as it goes along in a way that mimics the human brain. The researchers then carried out a validation experiment on a small dataset from healthy people, COVID-19 patients, pulmonary patients, and ocular patients.
Of 24 people with confirmed coronavirus infections, the tool correctly diagnosed 23, Fu tells The Scientist. And the algorithm accurately identified 30 out of 30 uninfected individuals.
Coronavirus infections, not just those caused by SARS-CoV-2, have long had associations with the eye, causing inflammation of the transparent membrane that covers the inside of the eyelid and whites of the eyeball, a condition called conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The eyes also offer a route to infection for respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses.
Human coronavirus NL63, which causes common cold symptoms, was first identified in 2004 in a baby with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. Subsequent studies showed that a minority of children infected with this coronavirus suffer from this eye condition.
Although conjunctivitis remains a potential symptom of coronavirus infections, less than 5 percent of COVID-19 patients actually present with eye symptoms, notes Daniel Ting, ophthalmologist at the Singapore National Eye Centre, who has published on this topic and deep learning in ophthalmology. “If you look to develop an AI system to detect COVID-19 based on [limited numbers of] eye images, I think the performance is not going to be great,” especially given the low prevalence of eye symptoms. He doubts the performance of the algorithm also because “a lot of eye manifestations could be due to reasons other than COVID-19.”
Ting cautions that the sample size of 303 patients and 136 healthy individuals in the Shanghai study is too small to draw strong conclusions. “To develop a good deep learning system to automatically detect some unique features from any medical imaging requires more patients,” he says. “In order to increase the reliability of this study, the same size would need to be multiplied by at least ten times, so, thousands of patients.”
Fu has started down this road, increasing the number of participants and broadening the types of subjects. “We are now doing more double-blind tests in the hospitals, with patients, some with eye diseases,” he says. The group also plans to introduce an online screening platform that uses the algorithm to screen for COVID-19.
“As an ophthalmologist it would be very surprising if there is a distinct COVID viral conjunctivitis pattern as opposed to other similar forms of viral conjunctivitis,” ophthalmologist Alastair Denniston, the director of the Health Data Research Hub for Eye Health in Birmingham, UK, writes in an email to The Scientist. “This is unlike building an algorithm for conditions which are biologically more distinct like macular degeneration,” he writes.
He notes that if there were a unique pattern evident in COVID-19 cases, “then the comparison for training and testing should be against cases that look similar,” such as non–COVID-19 viral conjunctivitis or other causes of a red eye associated with colds caused by adenovirus or rhinovirus. He also faults the paper in not providing “the necessary description to really critique the science in terms of how they built and (tried to) validate the model.”
Denniston recently reviewed more than 20,000 AI studies on detecting disease from medical imaging, but found that less than 1 percent were sufficiently robust in their design and reporting that independent reviewers had high confidence in their claims. This led him to convene a group of experts to define the international standards for the design and reporting of clinical trials of AI systems. These standards were published this month in Nature Medicine, The BMJ, and Lancet Digital Health and are supported by leading medical journals.
The Shanghai study has some potentially controversial applications, even if the AI works. Their algorithm could be used in public places, Fu says, though this would raise data privacy concerns in many countries. “In China, for example, we have a lot of high-resolution cameras everywhere,” he notes. “In airports or at train stations, we could use these surveillance cameras to check people’s eyes.” The program would be most accurate if people looked directly at the camera, but Fu says “as long as our camera can clearly watch the eye region it would be good enough.”
Screening the public without expressed consent using this algorithm would be ruled out of bounds in some parts of the world. “In Europe, this would be highly problematic and most likely illegal, in violation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and general data protection legislation,” says computer scientist Barry O’Sullivan of University College Cork in Ireland who is an expert in AI. The gathering of health data and biometric data in Europe requires consent.
O’Sullivan echoes the concern that the paper falls short on detail regarding its methodology. “It is an interesting hypothesis,” he says. But, as currently written, it isn’t ready for publication in a machine learning journal, he concludes.
The Immune Hallmarks of Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: Scanning electron microscope image of SARS-CoV-2 (gold) emerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab.

O
ne of the most striking features of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is the exceptional breadth of symptoms it causes in people. Of the nearly 30 million recorded infections to date, the vast majority of people experienced mild or moderate disease—which itself can range from no symptoms at all to pneumonia or long-term, debilitating neurological symptoms. A minority ended up with severe respiratory symptoms but eventually recovered. And some—nearly 940,000 worldwide, of which 196,000 are in the US—took a turn for the worse and died.
Why some people die while others recover is thought to depend in large part on the human immune response, which spirals out of control in severe disease. Over the past few months, researchers have developed a better understanding of this dysfunctional immune response. By comparing patients with varying degrees of disease severity, they’ve catalogued a number of dramatic changes across the human immune arsenal that are often apparent when patients first come into the hospital—from signaling cytokine proteins and first-responder cells of the innate immune system, to the B cells and T cells that confer pathogen-specific adaptive immunity.
The factors that trigger this immune dysregulation have so far remained elusive due to the complexity of the immune system, which consists of seemingly endless biological pathways that twist and turn and feed back on one another like a ball of spaghetti. But researchers—drawing on knowledge from other conditions such as sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune disease—are gradually building coherent theories of what puts patients en route to severe disease. Along the way, they’re also uncovering signals that clinicians could use to predict disease prognosis and identify potential new treatment avenues.
“We don’t have the clearest picture yet. Nor do we know why there’s variability in this immune response,” says Nuala Meyer, a critical care physician at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who researches sepsis. While it’s well-established that underlying conditions increase the risk for developing severe COVID-19, “I definitely see patients with diabetes, obesity, and high lipids that did not become severe [cases],” she says. “I think we have a lot of work to do to understand precisely what accounts for this differential response.”
Cytokine mayhem in severe COVID-19
Earlier this year, researchers learned that some of the body’s very first defenses against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be perturbed in patients who develop severe disease. When SARS-CoV-2 begins to multiply in cells lining the respiratory tract, both infected and some bystander immune cells release interferons, cytokines that, in general, act to curtail viral replication. But in May, scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai reported strikingly low levels of interferons in infected human cells in culture, and in live ferrets infected with the virus. Instead of responding with interferons, the cells had boosted their inflammatory pathways. Then, in a July study of COVID-19 patients’ blood, researchers in France found that the interferon response seemed to be blunted in patients with severe and critical disease, whereas interferon release was robust in those with mild and moderate symptoms.
Studies on mice infected with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that an early, strong interferon response is critical to resolving the infections, but if the response is delayed, the mice develop inflammatory immune reactions instead. Some data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of blocking interferon production in the cells it infects, and it appears to be much more effective in doing so than its cousin SARS-CoV. But some patients also appear to be less capable of mounting an interferon response even in uninfected immune cells, notes Miriam Merad, who directs the Precision Medicine Institute at Mount Sinai. Either way, without a solid interferon response, the virus will persist, causing damage that activates inflammatory pathways. “The higher the damage is, the more the immune system is trying to get rid of the damage,” says Merad, “so it gets activated and at some point … it goes completely crazy.” 
This over activation is clearly evident in the form of high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients’ blood—the “cytokine storm” that COVID-19 has become known for. In a recent analysis of nearly 1,500 COVID-19 patients, Merad and her colleagues found that concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in their serum upon admission correlated strongly with disease severity and death. Each cytokine could by itself predict whether a patient would survive. Interestingly, the nature of COVID-19’s cytokine response is markedly different from the cytokine storm side effect observed in some cancer patients who receive cellular immunotherapies and certain other hyperinflammatory conditions. In COVID-19 patients, concentrations of certain cytokines tend to be much lower—King’s College London immunologist Manu Shankar-Hari describes their increase as a “cytokine breeze” rather than a storm. But the increased cytokine levels are sustained over days and weeks, Merad says.
See “Immune Biomarkers Tied to Severe COVID-19: Study”
In a more comprehensive but smaller immunological study of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, researchers documented a number of immune features that are relatively common in chronic viral infections, such as T cells bearing markers of exhaustion, which could mean they’re less able to fight off pathogens. But in severe cases, three cytokines stood out and strongly correlated with the severity of the disease: IL-6, IL-10, and particularly IP-10. “Some of the changes are very similar to what people have reported in sepsis previously,” notes Shankar-Hari, who is a coauthor on the study. But severely ill patients have the added complication of an impaired interferon response, which he says he sees as the “core mechanism” driving these changes in other kinds of cytokines.
Scientists at Yale University tracking the progression of COVID-19 patients found that the cytokine increase was followed by haphazard-seeming immune responses in severely ill patients. While people with moderate disease appeared to activate immune machinery designed to fight off viruses, those with severe disease seemed to recruit cells and proteins that are typically associated with combating parasitic worms as well as immune responses designed to go after fungi and bacteria that live outside of cells—an unusual response the team describes as “immunological misfiring,” as if the immune system is failing to activate the right program. And while the immune responses of those who recovered faded gradually over time, the heightened activity was maintained in patients with severe disease. Ultimately, their frenzied cytokine response doesn’t do much to stem the virus—based on swabs from the nose and throat, severe and moderate patients began with similar viral loads that only dropped off in the moderate group.
Trouble in the innate immune system
Severe COVID-19 is also marked by dysfunction in the immune cells that are first at the scene of a viral infection, including myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. For instance, researchers from Germany recently analyzed the properties of these cells in the blood of 109 individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. Although patients with severe disease seemed to be manufacturing larger quantities of such cells, the cells themselves seemed to be only partially activated and dysfunctional. The neutrophils were largely immature, a feature that is thought to have a suppressive effect on the immune system, while the monocytes tended to have an inflammation-promoting phenotype and often lacked a critical surface protein (HLA-DR) needed for presenting viral material to T cells. The researchers didn’t spot these dysfunctional cells in mild or moderate cases.
It is, I think, really a myeloid-triggered disease.
—Miriam Merad, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Perhaps severe COVID-19 isn’t a purely inflammatory disease, but rather a dangerous loop of ineffective human immune responses and continuous tissue inflammation, says coauthor Leif Erik Sander, an immunologist and infectious disease specialist at the Charité hospital in Berlin.
See “Neutrophil Extracellular Traps May Augur Severe COVID-19”
Some of these myeloid cells in the blood of severely ill COVID-19 patients are indeed “functionally sluggish,” explains Stanford University immunologist Bali Pulendran, who recently found that the cells didn’t release cytokines when exposed to viral or bacterial debris in vitro. That suggested that the vast quantities of blood-borne cytokines weren’t coming from these first-responders in the blood, but from the lungs, where researchers have spotted high abundances of inflammatory macrophages and other myeloid-derived cells, he says. “The immune response in the lung was excessive inflammation, lots of cytokines. [But the] immune response in the blood was the opposite—it was suppression.” In contrast, moderately ill patients had significantly fewer suppressive cells in their blood. Sander notes that the precise sources of the cytokines, and their exact role in driving the severity of the disease, are yet to be elucidated.
But Merad suggests that the lung-dwelling inflammatory macrophages, the first immune cells to detect viral debris, could play an important role in driving the dysregulated cytokine response. 
These cells have been implicated strongly in the deleterious effects of aging, obesity, and diabetes—the same comorbidities linked to risk for severe COVID-19. Perhaps they’re “giving the wrong tone of inflammation in these patients” by over-activating T cells and other parts of the immune system, she says. “It is, I think, really a myeloid-triggered disease.” As for the sluggish, suppressive cells in the blood, maybe the body is somehow shutting down other parts of the immune response to prevent it from becoming overwhelmed, Pulendran says. The simultaneous immune suppression and over-activation has also been observed in sepsis, where it’s called “immunoparalysis.” 
Other innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, are also altered in severe cases of COVID-19 compared to non-severe cases, research by scientists in Sweden has shown. NK cells sense stressed cells and kill those infected with pathogens, while also releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and influencing T cell responses. NK cells come in different flavors, from less-differentiated ones fresh out of the bone marrow—which are good at proliferating and secreting cytokines—to highly differentiated super killers specialized for taking down virally infected cells. NK cells were more skewed toward the former group in moderate disease. But “a subpopulation of NK cells that are the most terminally differentiated, that are the most skewed towards killing, they were specifically expanded in the severely sick patients,” explains senior author Niklas Björkström, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute. Such killer cells have also been spotted in hantavirus and yellow fever virus infections, but it’s not clear if they play a deleterious role in driving further immune dysfunction or a protective role. “I’m a positive person. So I would still be hoping that the fact that we see them is because we need them for something at that severe stage, and that they are rather trying to do something good,” Björkström adds.
An adaptive immune system out of kilter
The components that make up our adaptive immune system also undergo drastic transformations in severe COVID-19. Some of these changes are expected. Like some other infectious disease patients, those with COVID-19 almost always have unusually low numbers of lymphocytes such as B cells and T cells in their blood—perhaps because those cells are dying off for some reason, or because they’re rushing into tissues to combat the infection, says Shankar-Hari. However, despite this shortage of lymphocytes, some patients’ T cells seemed to be highly activated, says Meyer, speaking of her own recent investigation of 125 hospitalized patients in Pennsylvania.
Maybe it’s not a numbers game with the T cells but rather has to do with the type of response that the ones present are exhibiting.
—Niklas Björkström, Karolinska Institute
The combination of depleted yet activated T cells “was not uniformly seen in all patients, but that was one of the features that did associate with the more severe course and more organ failure,” Meyer adds. Other work in critically ill COVID-19 patients finds—somewhat counter-intuitively—that T cells specifically targeted to SARS-CoV-2 proteins are not associated with recovery. “Maybe it’s not a numbers game with the T cells but rather has to do with the type of response that the ones present are exhibiting,” Björkström says.
COVID-19 patients also have vast quantities of antibody-secreting plasmablasts—another unusual feature of the disease. While other viral infections can provoke such a response, the increase tends to be short-lived, whereas in COVID-19 it seems to persist, Meyer adds. The blood of COVID-19 patients is also flooded with antibodies. But interestingly, new data from a study of 22 hospitalized patients suggest that although the quantity of antibodies didn’t differ between survivors and those who died, their function, and which viral proteins they targeted, correlated with severity.
See “Differences in Antibody Responses Linked to COVID-19 Outcomes”
Another peculiarity of the antibody response in severe COVID-19 patients is the apparent lack of a critical antibody creation process that takes place in the so-called germinal center of the lymph nodes and spleen. Ordinarily in viral infections, following a wave of initial virus-targeting antibodies that begins in the first few days of an infection, germinal centers form in the lymph nodes and spleen, where specialized B cells and T helper cells gather to produce a highly refined batch of antibody-producing cells that are crucial for lasting antibody immunity. But a study published last month demonstrated that those structures were absent in 11 COVID-19 patients who died from the disease. The germinal center formation may be stunted due to high levels of certain cytokines, the authors posit, or perhaps due to the defects of antigen-presenting cells that help drive that response, Shankar-Hari notes.
In line with those findings, data reported in a preprint by a team of Emory University researchers show that the abundance of two subtypes of B cells that create short-lived antibodies outside the germinal center correlated strongly with disease severity in 17 hospitalized patients, while those cells were barely present in healthy controls. The expansion of these B cell types has been primarily associated with flare-ups of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where they’re reflective of an overly inflammatory state. It’s possible that this abnormal B cell response is the body’s attempt to generate antibodies after being somehow hindered from making them in germinal centers. Yet findings from autoimmune diseases also hint that “it may be that some of these cells are actually worsening the inflammatory cascade,” says Richard Ramonell, one of the study’s coauthors and a fellow in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Emory.
Merad says she thinks these abnormalities of the adaptive immune system are driven by the dysregulated cytokine response, which may be ultimately rooted in myeloid defects. But the intimate dialog between the innate and adaptive immune systems makes it hard to tease out cause and effect—an issue that comes up in autoimmune diseases all the time, notes Matthew Woodruff, an immunologist at Emory. “You see an autoimmune patient in the clinic, and you’ve got this entire system that has already been thrown out of balance in some way. . . . You’ve already established a new homeostatic process, and you can describe it, you can intervene, you can do all of those things. But the chicken and egg questions continue to be very, very difficult to answer.”   
Turning immunology findings into biomarkers and treatments
At the moment, clinicians use several biomarkers to assess COVID-19 patients’ general inflammatory state, including D-dimer, which measures protein fragments that arise from blood clots, and the inflammatory indicator C-reactive protein (CRP), both of which correlate with disease severity. However, COVID-19–specific and earlier biomarkers would be needed to reliably identify patients on hospital admission or earlier who are destined to develop critical disease. “If we can somehow identify them before they come into the hospital, or while they’re in the emergency room before they get intubated, we could potentially change their disease course,” notes immunologist and pulmonologist F. Eun-Hyung Lee of Emory University.
Over the past few months, studies investigating immune features that correlate with COVID-19 severity have yielded a number of candidate biomarkers based on immune cells, specific antibody features, and cytokines. They include the IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α cytokines that Miriam Merad and her colleagues found elevated in severely ill patients in a cohort of 1,500 individuals treated at Mount Sinai Health System. Merad’s team validated those cytokines in a second cohort of 231 patients, and demonstrated that they were indeed predictive of disease severity. Other research that has flagged IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 as potentially predictive markers seems promising but would need to be validated in a larger group of patients, notes Nuala Meyer, a critical care physician at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
Some of Meyer’s research has found that the ratio of neutrophils to leukocytes—which is easy to measure in the clinic—can predict dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Other work has flagged other cytokines and serum bicarbonate, which reflects electrolyte imbalances and is a readily available lab test. But in that study, “it did not look like all COVID patients fit into [the] hyper-inflammatory group. So in a way I think we need to do more work to understand what are better plasma biomarkers for severe COVID,” she says.
Findings from such studies are also providing insights into new treatment approaches for COVID-19. Several trials are underway that aim to administer interferon—which is already used to treat hepatitis C—to patients. However, timing is key when it comes to interferon treatment—if it’s given too late, it could worsen the disease. 
For later in the course of disease, immune-dampening steroid drugs such as dexamethasone and other corticosteroids—which can curtail the activity of multiple cytokines in tandem—appear to be effective in reducing the risk of death. But corticosteroid treatments often have side effects, especially for elderly patients, and more targeted therapies would be preferable. 
So far, researchers haven’t had any luck in tamping down levels of individual cytokines. Doing so for IL-6, for instance, is effective in dampening the cytokine storm that occurs in some cancer patients receiving cellular immunotherapy. The pharma giant Roche recently reported that its CONVACTA trial testing its IL-6–targeting drug Actemra did not improve the clinical status of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. And a smaller study testing the IL-6 blocking agent sarilumab in severe disease also proved disappointing to Merad, she says. A combination treatment that blocks multiple cytokines might be the way to go, she suggests. But COVID-19 is also a very heterogeneous disease, making it difficult to interpret clinical signals, she notes. “We need to tailor the treatment to the molecular effect.”
Alternatively, it may not be the cytokine increase that’s killing patients. Some researchers have recently expressed doubt that cytokines play a major role in driving the severity of the disease based on small studies suggesting that levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are much lower in severe COVID-19 than in patients without COVID-19 who die of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
Perhaps the ultimate culprit is a coagulation problem driven by the raging inflammation of blood vessels, says immunologist Niklas Björkström of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, noting that infusions of the anticoagulant heparin reduced the fatality rate in some patient groups. “The fact that a lot of our patients have problems with clotting raises interest perhaps in the complement pathway or novel anticoagulant strategies,” Meyer says. In addition, “I do think we’re interested to know if we can perhaps intelligently intervene on this T cell activation without tipping the balance too much towards immune suppression,” she adds. 
Half a year into a pandemic, “I understand that the public is frustrated. Even my family’s like, ‘Can’t you figure it out?’” Merad says. However, answers are on their way, and at breakneck speed, in large part thanks to technological advances over the past decades. “We are [learning] much faster than any time in history where we’ve had a big disease [outbreak] like that. So I’m confident that the few months to come are going to be extremely informative.”
University of Michigan Grad Students Strike over COVID-19 Policy/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PAWEL.GAUL
Update (September 18): Students at the University of Michigan have reluctantly ended their strike, noting in a press release reported by Inside Higher Ed, “We won workable pandemic childcare options; substantive support for international graduate students; transparent COVID-19 testing protocols; and incremental but real movement on our policing demands.”
G
raduate students and residential advisors at the University of Michigan have gone on strike over the school’s COVID-19 response plan, prompting the university’s president to seek a court-mandated temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to force students back to work. 
The student workers are striking with the support of their union, the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO), which represents more than 2,000 graduate student instructors and staff assistants. Since September 8, they have been joined by more than 100 residential advisers in arguing that the university did not provide adequate COVID-19 protections. 
“I personally have not spoken to a single person who thinks our COVID reopening plan was well conceived,” Silke-Maria Weineck, a professor of comparative literature and German studies at the university, tells Inside Higher Education. “What you have right now, I think, is a campus getting close to open revolt.” 
At the heart of the strike lies the University of Michigan’s fall plans for reopening campus. Graduate students, who are involved in teaching roughly 3,500 courses, claim the university has failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect the well being of students and faculty. As a result, they have stopped holding classes or carrying out research.
“We need a fair and just pandemic response,” Jeff Lockhart, a PhD candidate in sociology and a union member, tells Inside Higher Ed. “The university is disregarding all of the best evidence and advice from its own experts in terms of how they should be reopening.”
The university has reopened in a hybrid format, with more than 75 percent of its courses online, although students have been allowed to return to campus housing. Faculty and graduate students have said the administration largely accommodated their requests to teach remotely, but others felt coerced or misled after making their decisions to teach in person  in June, when community spread was lower.
The students are also striking against the university’s COVID-19 testing protocol, which is less stringent than those at other universities. Before allowing students back, the school tested only those students living in dorms or involved in fraternity organizations. Now that classes have started, testing is mostly limited to students with symptoms. 
While the school is conducting surveillance testing among undergraduates, participation is voluntary and testing is capped at 3,000 tests per week, Inside Higher Ed reports.
Michigan state officials recently released data showing that college campuses are creating new COVID-19 hotspots. Within the state, Grand Valley State University has 438 cases among its students, Central Michigan University has 271 cases among students, and Adrian College has 229 cases among both students and staff. The University of Michigan has so far reported 77 cases among its students, according to The Detroit News.
Students say they don’t feel supported by campus officials in trying to make campuses safe. “I do feel like they are not taking us seriously, like they can wait us out,” Alyssa Frizzo, a junior and residential adviser, tells Inside Higher Ed. “I don’t think throughout this whole process including the town halls they’ve really understood how serious we are about this.”
The union is calling for more testing and tracing, the option to switch to remote teaching without documentation, subsidies for student parents, support for international students, funding extensions, and rent freezes for those in campus housing, Inside Higher Ed reports. Among RAs, their demands include hazard pay, regular testing, personal protective equipment, and greater enforcement of safety measures.
In addition, the union has made cutting ties with local police and federal immigration authorities, as well as a 50 percent reduction in funding to campus police, mandatory for ending the strike. In an op-ed in The Michigan Daily, faculty from the University of Michigan supported these goals, adding that “policing is an important public health issue.”
While the strike is being denounced as illegal by university President Mark Schlissel—public employees are not allowed to strike in the state, and the union contract also stipulates a no-strike clause—it has drawn largely positive support from the rest of the university. More than 680 faculty members and 850 scholars from other institutions have signed open letters in support of the strike, and unionized construction workers and truck drivers have refused to complete work on campus, Inside Higher Ed reports. Dining hall employees had scheduled a walkout in solidarity, but the event was canceled out of fear of retaliation, according to The Michigan Daily.
Schlissel had previously filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union, but after students voted to continue their strike on Sunday (September 13), he pursued new charges, including the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
Speaking in a video on Monday, September 14, Schlissel defended his choice. “We want our great classes to continue, our students to learn without interference and we don’t want anyone to feel threatened simply for wanting to go to class,” Schlissel said. “Going to the court was our only choice after learning the strike would continue. We’d much rather our classes be in session while we work out our differences together.”
The union responded with a written statement stating, “we always knew legal action was a possibility, and this was a transparent part of our multiple member-wide discussions about the risks of authorizing a work stoppage,” The Michigan Daily reports. “Moreover, this legal move is a clear sign that withholding our labor is working: The University is feeling our power.”
Indian Study Shows No Survival Benefit of Plasma in COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CHOJA

n the absence of a vaccine or an effective antidote to SARS-CoV-2, the use of convalescent plasma therapy is in vogue globally. It involves the infusion of plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and thus carry protective antibodies into patients who are currently infected with the coronavirus. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for its use, although the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard of scientific research, has led to skepticism about its effectiveness among experts.
In light of this, the PLACID (PLAsma Convalescent InDia) trial helps fill this gap. Recently conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex medical research body in India, it is the first RCT for plasma in COVID-19 patients to be completed in the world. The study included 464 hospitalized, moderately ill COVID-19 patients—they were on supplemental oxygen but not critically ill with organ damage—across 39 medical centers between April 22 and July 14. The trial had two arms: an intervention arm, in which patients received two doses of 200 ml of convalescent plasma, 24 hours apart, along with standard of care, and a control arm that received standard of care alone.
The results, posted as a preprint on September 8 with a revision posted two days later, signal that the use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients did not forestall progression to severe disease or mortality.
Study coauthor Pankaj Malhotra, a clinical hematologist at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, says that these results won’t have much effect on clinical practice in India where convalescent plasma therapy is hugely popular and where the total number of COVID-19 cases has crossed 4.9 million. In June, the Indian health ministry recommended off-label use of plasma in COVID-19 patients who showed no improvement despite standard of care. Malhotra adds that the study could perhaps lead to a decline in the burgeoning illegal trade in plasma in the country. 
Arturo Casadevall, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells The Scientist, “It’s the first RCT that was completed for convalescent plasma and I think that is a significant accomplishment.” An RCT in China was halted prematurely in late March due to dwindling cases and another in the Netherlands was discontinued as antibody titers in recipients were found to be comparable to that of donors, raising questions about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma. In the US currently, there are more than 20 RCTs that are actively recruiting patients, but none have been completed. A large Mayo Clinic study that was part of the US Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma and that led to the FDA’s EUA was nonrandomized.
Despite the lack of survival benefit shown in the ICMR study, some positives gleaned from the trial include improved symptoms and oxygenation and faster viral clearance in patients in the intervention arm compared with the control arm.
Michael Joyner, the lead author of the Mayo Clinic study that prompted the FDA to grant EUA for convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 in the US, tells The Scientist that the authors, the Indian research council, and the country deserve a lot of credit for doing this trial under very difficult circumstances. “I think that’s most impressive. . . . So, high compliments there.”
“I see the cup being half full in terms of the viral load data and the improved oxygenation and so forth,” Joyner says. The half empty part, he adds, is that most of the plasma had low titers of antibodies and was given relatively late during the course of the disease—a median of eight days after onset of symptoms. “Those are the two main limitations of the study.”
See “The Search for Immune Responses that Stop COVID-19”
The Mayo Clinic investigators found that early treatment with plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, within three days of diagnosis, with high levels of protective antibodies decreases mortality compared with later treatment using plasma with low titers of antibodies. Since this study did not include a control arm, however, the researchers can’t say if the reduced mortality was due to plasma treatment.
Casadevall, who is involved in two clinical trials at Hopkins to test whether plasma therapy is effective in COVID-19, finds the results of the Indian study encouraging, and contends that the low titers, likely because many of the donors were younger and fitter and had only mild disease, and the late use of plasma could perhaps account for the lack of survival benefit.
Adrian Newland, a hematologist at Barts Health NHS Trust, tells The Scientist in an email, “It has also been seen that the antibody titers often fall off quite quickly so the chances of only 200 ml of serum (given twice) of providing any significant protection is small.”
He adds that the standard of care is continuously improving and contributing to better survival. “Therefore, it is likely that if the benefit of convalescent serum is small, the impact is likely to be masked.”
Terry Gernsheimer, a hematologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, writes in an email to The Scientist, “The numbers [in the ICMR study] are small and we don’t know how many patients it would take to treat before we would actually see a difference.”
She adds that randomization against standard of care is problematic as it is very difficult to keep either the patient or the staff blinded to the treatments that patients are receiving. In addition, the possible immunomodulatory effects of donor plasma, even plasma that is not convalescent, cannot be known. The best control arm, she says, would be non-convalescent plasma, which was not done. “Unfortunately that is true of all studies to date,” observes Gernsheimer.
See “First Antibody Trial Launched in COVID-19 Patients”
Thomas Marron, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells The Scientist in an email, “I’m happy to see that there is finally some randomized data to report. That said, I still don’t think we are testing the appropriate population in many of these trials.”
He says that it is likely that viral control—which the antibodies in plasma are supposed to do—is more important during the early phase, while control of the hyperinflammatory response would be crucial in patients with more advanced disease. “I would worry that by the time you are having moderate respiratory distress, the horse has left the barn, and while we may give antivirals and convalescent plasma to stem any further viral spread, managing the inflammation should be the primary focus.”
There’s also the question of antibodies’ overall utility. “There is also the uncertainty of the importance of antibodies in fighting the [SARS-CoV-2] infection,” writes Newland. “There is increasing evidence that T lymphocytes are a more important source of immunity and this is one of the measures used in assessing the effectiveness of the vaccines now being developed.”
He says, “I think that, ultimately, convalescent serum has little to offer.”
Gernsheimer, who is involved in studies on convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 in the US, is more optimistic. “I think the best we can say here, which is what we have noted from the 70,000 patients who received convalescent plasma under a nonrandomized access to the plasma in the US, is that there is no apparent harm and further studies need to be done.”

College Athletes Experienced Heart Damage After COVID-19: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ACESHOT
M
onths after recovering from COVID-19, some college athletes are showing signs of heart inflammation brought on by a rare condition called myocarditis that may be linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposure, doctors reported September 11 in JAMA Cardiology.
When they imaged the hearts of more than two dozen of Ohio State University players using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), they found evidence of myocarditis in 15 percent, while a further 30 percent had cellular damage or swelling that could not be linked definitively to the condition. 
In their report, the doctors offer an additional risk assessment tool for universities and professional sports agencies looking to balance the risk to their athletes against a desire to resume play. 
“Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes,” the authors write in the study. “Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to identify a high-risk cohort for adverse outcomes and may, importantly, risk-stratify athletes for safe participation.”
Several large sporting events have recently been canceled, such as the Big Ten Conference (which includes Ohio State), due in part to concern over heart conditions in players who have contracted the virus.
While myocarditis is a rare condition—affecting roughly 22 out of every 100,000 people each year—it is nevertheless a recognized cause of death among professional athletes, even in the absence of previous heart trouble. A 2015 study found that among NCAA athletes who died of a sudden cardiac event, 10 percent experienced myocarditis, and a Myocarditis Foundation report found that the condition causes 75 deaths per year in athletes between the ages of 13 and 25. 
ESPN reports that COVID-19 has been linked with myocarditis at a higher frequency than other viruses have been, based on limited studies and anecdotal evidence. A recent study of 100 patients in Germany found that 60 percent suffered from myocarditis following their COVID-19 diagnoses, independent of pre-existing conditions.
To assess the presence of myocarditis in college athletes that have recovered from COVID-19, the authors selected 26 students at Ohio State University, including men and women. None of the participants, who played football, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, or track, had previous heart conditions before being tested.
All 26 participants had contracted the coronavirus between June and August and had their cases verified using a PCR test. The timing between their diagnosis and their subsequent testing for myocarditis varied between 11 days to almost two months. Twelve of the athletes reported mild symptoms while sick, while the rest were asymptomatic.
Ordinarily, athletes may have their heart health assessed using a battery of tests: a physical examination, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram, and a blood test to measure for the heart stress protein troponin I. The current study included all these tests, but also added the CMR, which the authors say was the most successful tool at identifying cases of myocarditis.
“We were able to differentiate those who had evidence of myocardial inflammation—and therefore myocarditis—from those who did not, and the [CMR] became the tool that did that with the highest sensitivity,” Curt Daniels, a cardiologist at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and a coauthor of the study, tells the Akron Beacon Journal. 
Among the 26 athletes, four met at least two criteria consistent with a diagnosis of myocarditis, while a further eight showed inconclusive evidence of strain. Among the four, all of which were men, two had experienced symptoms while the other two were asymptomatic, the authors report.
The current study “is really a step in the right direction,” Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved in the study, tells Science News. “We need more data like this.”
But Wasfy points to several important limitations that will make it difficult to apply the study’s findings more broadly. For one, it was small, did not include controls, and did not test its participants at the same time interval following their diagnosis, all facets that the authors tell Science News they plan to rectify in subsequent follow-ups.
Because of the varying times between diagnosis with COVID-19 and the heart analysis, there were several cases where the different tests the researchers used yielded different results. For example, there were cases in which the CMR identified possible signs of myocarditis even when the players’ troponin I levels or electrocardiograms were normal. In these cases, Wasfy says, it may be that the CMR is picking up the “ghost” of past inflammation, even as other symptoms have since gone away.
Myocarditis has been found in at least five Big Ten Conference athletes and among players in other conferences, two sources with knowledge of the situation tell ESPN. In addition, at least a dozen Power 5 schools have identified athletes with a post–COVID-19 myocardial injury, including asymptomatic patients. “Initially we thought if you didn’t have significant symptoms that you are probably at less risk,” Matthew Martinez, director of sports cardiology for Atlantic Health System, tells ESPN. “We are now finding that that may not be true.”
The overall concern has “made the bar higher” for returning to fall sports, Jonathan Drezner, director of the University of Washington Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology, tells ESPN. “It  could be we don’t get there.”

Scientists Voice Concerns over Russian COVID-19 Vaccine Study/-/ABOVE: The Russian vaccine relies on a human adenovirus to prime the body’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

T
he first data detailing Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine—nicknamed Sputnik—was published last week (September 4) in The Lancet. Almost immediately, other scientists began to call attention to unlikely patterns in the data, asking for raw numbers to verify the study’s conclusions.
Enrico Bucci, a systems biologist and bioethicist at Temple University, published an open letter on his blog September 7 to draw The Lancet’s attention to suspected data manipulation. While he stresses that the letter is not an allegation, “the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate.”
The study reports results of Russia’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of its vaccine candidate, carried out by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute. The tests took place between June and July of this year with 76 participants, and researchers trialed two versions of a human adenovirus vector–based immunization, an approach similar to that of the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford joint initiative. The benign virus contains the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that when expressed primes the immune system to recognize the virus as a threat. 
See “Vector-Based Vaccines Come to the Fore in the COVID-19 Pandemic”
Researchers carried out two simultaneous studies in two different hospitals, each of which involved 38 people involved in either a Phase1 or Phase 2 trial. During the Phase 1 portion, nine participants received the human adenovirus 26 (Ad26) vector and another nine received the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector. In Phase 2, 20 patients were given an initial dose of the Ad26 version followed by a booster of Ad5. The results show that all patients generated antibodies to the virus after 28 days, although the levels were not as high as those seen in other studies, Chemistry World reports. Side effects were said to be common, but mild.
Based on the results of this trial, Russia recently began a Phase 3 trial involving 40,000 participants. Roughly 31,000 people have already been recruited to take part since its launch on August 26, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko tells Reuters. Even without the results of this latest trial, Russia plans to ramp up production of a finished product for distribution beginning this month, a move that has alarmed scientists worldwide.
Bucci and the other cosigners of the open letter noted “strange duplicated patterns in the data, among different groups, observing different variables,” Chemistry World reports. For example, measurements of CD4 T cell counts for nine people in the study closely matched a different set of nine patients who had their CD8 T cells measured. In other instances, multiple participants had identical antibody levels.
“It’s like you enter a room with nine people and you add their ages together and find that that number is exactly the same as the combined weight of those people,” Bucci tells Chemistry World. “It is strange. But we don’t have access to the data and we can’t really assess what is going on.”
In addition, the study design was such that the statistical power to draw conclusions is limited. “They tested six different formulations, basically split among six groups of volunteers,” Bucci adds. “It is like six independent studies in a single article.” 
Bucci is not the only one to stress that the study’s conclusions are tentative at best.
Luke O’Neill, an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin, tells Chemistry World that the immune response appeared weak, and that the study lacked a control group. Saad Shakir, the director of the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) in the UK, spoke more plainly. “It is very preliminary. That’s the bottom line. No one has demonstrated that these [antibody] elevations will translate into protecting people”
In response to the letter’s points, Denis Logunov, a deputy director at the Gamaleya Institute, refuted the claims, stating that he provided all the raw data to the journal ahead of publication even if they were not included in the paper’s supplementary material. “The published results are authentic and accurate and were examined by five reviewers at The Lancet,” Logunov says in a statement to Reuters. “We presented specifically the data that was produced [by the trial], not the data that is supposed to please Italian experts,” he adds. Bucci and a number of other signatories are from Italy. 
At least one of the paper’s reviewers has defended his analysis of the data. In an email to Reuters, Naor Bar-Zeev, an epidemiologist at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that “the results are plausible, and not very different to those seen with other AdV vectored products. Bottom line, I saw no reason to doubt the legitimacy of these results over others I have read and reviewed.”
A Lancet spokesperson has stated to Reuters that they are monitoring the situation and encouraging the authors of the Russian study to respond to questions raised in the open letter.
COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Pauses After Adverse Reaction/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ZORANM
Update (September 14): Oxford University and AstraZeneca announced Saturday, September 12, that they will be resuming their UK trials after a temporary pause following  a case of transverse myelitis in a UK patient.
A
series of late-stage clinical trials establishing the effectiveness and safety of a joint AstraZeneca and University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine are on hold after one UK participant in a Phase 3 trial developed a severe and unexplained illness. 
The incident was first reported on Tuesday (September 8) by STAT. The pause will delay results from one of the world’s largest COVID-19 vaccine development efforts. A company spokesperson says the measure has been taken out of an abundance of caution.
“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated,” AstraZeneca shared in a prepared statement. “We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.”
Details of the adverse event that initiated the pause, including how serious it is and when it happened, have not been shared publicly. A person familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity with The New York Times, says that the participant had been diagnosed with transverse myelitis, an inflammatory condition in the spinal cord that is often sparked by viral infections. 
Gabriella Garcia, a neurologist at Yale New Haven Hospital, tells the Times transverse myelitis is often treatable with steroids. When asked to confirm the diagnosis, AstraZeneca declined to comment. “The event is being investigated by an independent committee, and it is too early to conclude the specific diagnosis,” the company says.
Currently, there are nine vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials, and AstraZeneca is the first to announce a pause. It is unknown how long the hold will continue. Marie-Paule Kieny, a vaccine researcher at INSERM, the national health research institute in Paris, tells Nature that if AstraZeneca can quickly rule out the vaccine as a source of the illness, the trial could be running again “in a matter of weeks.”
One Phase 3 trial has been underway in the US since late August with plans to enroll up to 30,000 participants at 80 sites across the country. Other trials of the same vaccine are also progressing in other countries, including Brazil and South Africa, with additional trials planned for Japan and Russia. Money to fund the US trial came from Operation Warp Speed, a US federal initiative to quickly disperse funds to the most promising vaccine candidates. AstraZeneca received $1.2 billion dollars to produce 300 million doses, Buzzfeed reports.
The company’s vaccine relies on an experimental method, based on an adenovirus vector from chimpanzees, that has yet to lead to any approved immunizations, although it was used previously in studies to treat influenza and Ebola, according to STAT. Scientists engineered the virus to smuggle the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into human cells. Once inside, the protein prompts a natural immune response, priming immune cells to recognize SARS-CoV-2.
See “Vector-Based Vaccines Come to the Fore in the COVID-19 Pandemic”
The Phase 1 and 2 trials of the vaccine involved 1,077 patients, Buzzfeed reports, and the results showed that 90 percent of participants subsequently tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. While roughly 60 percent of patients reported mild or moderate side effects such as fever, headaches, and muscle aches, these symptoms resolved before the end of the trial.
Phase 3 trials, which assess efficacy, can also look for less common side effects only be detected when vaccines are tested on large numbers of people. Because of their large size, these studies are considered the most important for establishing safety, according to the Associated Press.
Some scientists are saying the pause is not unexpected, and in fact shows that the clinical trial protocol is operating as it should. On the same day that AstraZeneca announced the suspension, the company’s CEO joined eight other pharmaceutical companies in announcing a commitment to integrity and safety moving forward with vaccine trials.
“This is the whole point of doing these Phase 2, Phase 3 trials,” Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco, tells the Times. “We need to assess safety, and we won’t know the efficacy part until much later. I think halting the trial until the safety board can figure out whether or not this was directly related to the vaccine is a good idea.” 
Pauses in trials can happen for any number of reasons. Any unexplained illness that requires hospitalization, for example, could trigger a safety assessment to determine if it is linked to an injection with an experimental vaccine. “It does happen. It’s not common, but it does happen,” Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, tells BuzzFeed. “The vaccine is to stop SARS-CoV-2. It’s not designed to stop everything else that happens in life. You want to make sure it was related to the vaccine, especially if it happened a short period of time after the vaccine begins.” 
Joe Walters, one of the participants in the University of Oxford trial in the UK, spoke this week to The Guardian about his experiences, sharing that he developed a persistent fever after receiving his initial injection (although it’s unknown whether he received the vaccine candidate or a control). He was briefly hospitalized and tested for COVID-19, and after his test came back negative, he learned that other participants had experienced similar side effects.
Walters heard about the pause the day he came to receive his second dose. For now, his participation is on hold, but Walters says he plans to continue “in the name of science,” adding that the trial is “something positive to do in the face of something that rendered everyone rather helpless.”
AstraZeneca is one of three companies testing vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the US. The other two companies, Moderna and BioNTech, are developing vaccines using different methods than those used by AstraZeneca. A spokesperson for Moderna tells the Times the firm’s work has not been affected by the latest pause.

Vector-Based Vaccines Come to the Fore in the COVID-19 Pandemic/-/ABOVE: Colored transmission electron microscopic image of adenovirus virions

S
ix vaccine candidates in clinical trials for COVID-19 employ viruses to deliver genetic cargo that, once inside our cells, instructs them to make SARS-CoV-2 protein. This stimulates an immune response that ideally would protect recipients from future encounters with the actual virus. Three candidates rely on weakened human adenoviruses to deliver the recipe for the spike protein of the pandemic coronavirus, while two use primate adenoviruses and one uses measles virus.
Most viral vaccines are based on attenuated or inactivated viruses. An upside of using vectored vaccines is that they are easy and relatively cheap to make. The adenovirus vector, for example, can be grown up in cells and used for various vaccines. Once you make a viral vector, it is the same for all vaccines, says Florian Krammer, a vaccinologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “It is just the genetic information in it that is different,” he explains.
Once inside a cell, viral vectors hack into the same molecular system as SARS-CoV-2 and faithfully produce the spike protein in its three dimensions. This resembles a natural infection, which provokes a robust innate immune response, triggering inflammation and mustering B and T cells.
But the major downside to the human adenoviruses is that they circulate widely, causing the common cold, and some people harbor antibodies that will target the vaccine, making it ineffective.
Human adenovirus vectors
CanSino reported on its Phase II trial this summer of its COVID-19 vaccine that uses adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5). The company noted that 266 of the 508 participants given the shot had high pre-existing immunity to the Ad5 vector, and that older participants had a significantly lower immune response to the vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine will not work so well in them.
With vectors you are always trying to find the sweet spot. Too weak, and they don’t work. Too strong, and they are too toxic.
—Nikolai Petrovsky, Flinders University
“The problem with adenovirus vectors is that different populations will have different levels of immunity, and different age groups will have different levels of immunity,” says Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine researcher at Flinders University in Australia. Also, with age, a person accumulates immunity to more serotypes. “Being older is associated with more chance to acquire Ad5 immunity, so those vaccines will be an issue [with elderly people],” Krammer explains. Moreover, immunity against adenoviruses lasts for many years.
“A lot of people have immunity to Ad5 and that impacts on how well the vaccine works,” says Krammer. In the US, around 40 percent of people have neutralizing antibodies to Ad5. As part of her work on an HIV vaccine, Hildegund Ertl of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia previously collected serum in Africa to gauge resistance levels to this and other serotypes. She found a high prevalence of Ad5 antibodies in sub-Saharan Africa and some West African countries—80 to 90 percent. A different group in 2012 reported that for children in northeast China, around one-quarter had moderate levels and 9 percent had high levels of Ad5 antibodies.  “I don’t think anyone has done an extensive enough study to do a world map [of seroprevalence],” notes Ertl.
J&J’s Janssen is using a rarer adenovirus subtype, Ad26, in its COVID-19 vaccine, reporting in July that it protects macaques against SARS-CoV-2 and in September that it protects against severe clinical disease in hamsters. Ad26 neutralizing antibodies are uncommon in Europe and the US, with perhaps 10–20 percent of people harboring antibodies. They are more common elsewhere. “In sub-Saharan Africa, the rates are ranging from eighty to ninety percent,” says Ertl.
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
Also critical is the level of antibodies in individuals, notes Dan Barouch, a vaccinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. For instance, there was no neutralizing of Ad26-based HIV and Ebola vaccines in more than 80,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, he says. “Ad26 vaccine responses do not appear to be suppressed by the baseline Ad26 antibodies found in these populations,” because the titres are low, Barouch writes in an email to The Scientist. Barouch has long experience with Ad26-based vaccines and collaborates with J&J on their COVID-19 vaccine.
The Russian Sputnik V vaccine, approved despite no published data or Phase 3 trial results, starts with a shot of Ad26 vector followed by a booster with Ad5, both of which carry the gene for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This circumvents a downside of viral vector vaccines, specifically, once you give the first shot, subsequent injections will be less efficacious because of antibodies against the vector. Ertl says she has no idea of the proportion of the Russian population with Ad26 or Ad5 antibodies, and there seems to be little or no published data from countries that have expressed interested in this virus, such as Venezuela and the Philippines.
Simian adenovirus vectors
An alternative is look to our nearest relatives. Chimp adenoviruses were the focus of vaccine interest by Ertl for HIV and by Adrian Hill at the University of Oxford for malaria. “About one percent of people have antibodies to the chimp adenovirus, probably because of cross reactivity, which is why we use it,” explains Hill, referring to the COVID-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which has shown antibody and T cell responses in an early phase clinical trial. This candidate, which also encodes the instructions for producing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is now in Phase 3 trials in the UK, US, South Africa, and Brazil and is to be manufactured by AstraZeneca.
Unfortunately, says Ertl, use of the attenuated chimp virus in a COVID-19 vaccine means it cannot now be used for malaria, because those vaccinated for the coronavirus will have antibodies against the vector. But there are other simian vectors. In Italy, a Phase 1 trial of a COVID-19 vaccine with a gorilla adenovirus vector has begun recruiting healthy volunteers. Ertl says that having multiple adenoviruses from different species is “a good thing, because it broadens the range of diseases we could tackle.” It could also allow animal virus vectors for COVID-19 vaccines to be used in places where human adenovirus immunity is high.
Not everyone is enthusiastic about vector-based vaccines. “Their reactogenicity profile is not great,” says Petrovsky, meaning they stimulate a strong immune response. “Even [President Vladimir] Putin commented that his daughter had a fever [after taking Sputnik V]. Generally, fevers are a no-no for a vaccine.” He says headache and fever have been relatively common in early results from vaccines based on viral vectors. Some people are prone to having convulsions from fevers, so extreme reactions cannot be ruled out, he adds.
Petrovsky says children generally react more strongly to vaccines than adults do, and that could be a huge drawback in countries with young populations such as India. “With vectors you are always trying to find the sweet spot,” says Petrovsky, which is their Achilles’s heel.  “Too weak, and they don’t work. Too strong, and they are too toxic.” Petrovsky is involved in the development of Covax-19, a recombinant protein–based vaccine plus adjuvant that is in early clinical trials and was developed by his company Vaxine Pty in Australia.
So far, there is not much experience with vector-based vaccines on the market. The European Medicines Agency granted market authorization in May for a new Ebola vaccine that consists of a prime shot with an Ad26 vector, and a booster with an attenuated poxvirus (MVA). An HIV vaccine trial based on Ertl’s research was to have started this fall, but has been delayed until next year due to COVID-19. “We don’t have post-licensing experience,” says Ertl, in relation to vector-based vaccines, “but these things have been in multiple trials, so we have a reasonably good idea about what doses are tolerated and about safety concerns.”
A measles vector
In August, a trial in France and Belgium began recruiting volunteers to test a COVID-19 vaccine based on a replicating measles vaccine virus. This so-called Schwartz strain was weakened in the 1960s by serial passaging on chicken cells. The virus expresses the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and has been tested in mice, say scientists at the Pasteur Institute in France who licensed the vector technology to Themis in Austria. It was previously tested on mice for SARS and for MERS.
It was shown previously that pre-existing immunity to measles acquired by infection in the elderly or vaccination in young people did not dampen responses to a Chikungunya vaccine based on this same vector. The measles vector “goes into cells, then makes more measles vaccine. It will come out again, infect more cells, but after a few cycles it stops,” says vaccine scientist Christiane Gerke of the Pasteur Institute who is leading the COVID-19 vaccine trial. That the measles strain replicates distinguishes it from the adenovirus vectors and could explain why pre-existing antibodies do not matter. “So long as measles antibodies at the start do not eliminate all of the vaccine, then the vaccine replicates itself,” says Gerke.
The live nature of the measles vaccine strain means that it could not be given to immunocompromised individuals. However, the Swartz strain has about 50 mutations and measles vaccine strains have never escaped these attenuation shackles and caused disease in healthy people. “It is a promising candidate,” says Krammer, though a little behind the others. The Pasteur Institute could not confirm whether volunteers had begun receiving the vaccine. In June, Themis was acquired by Merck, a company with a significant vaccine portfolio.
Success with viral vectors has implications for vaccine development overall. “It took a very long time for viral vectors to end up on the market, which they did with the Ebola vaccines,” says Krammer. “The way I see it, this is going to speed up vaccine development in general.” That is, as long as there is a successful outcome with a COVID-19 vaccine. Any misstep by a regulator with one of these vaccines could retard the potential of vector-based vaccines for multiple diseases, says Krammer.  
COVID-19 Symptoms in Kids Most Often Headache, Fever: App Data/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HALFPOINT
A
symptom-tracking app indicates that children experience different COVID-19 symptoms than adults, The Guardian reports. While a persistent cough and a diminished sense of taste and smell are common among adults, the app has found, children with the virus most commonly experience symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and fever, among others. 
Since the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019, scientists have been scrambling to understand its effects on human health. In March, an international group of scientists and institutions announced the COVID Symptom Study to obtain data from patients with COVID-19. According to its website, the app has received self-reported information on more than 4.1 million patients, helping to identify patterns based on demographics.
More than half of the 198 children in their system who tested positive for the virus experienced fatigue and headaches, according to The Guardian. Fever occurred in around 50 percent. Around one-third of the kids had sore throats, and a minority of children exhibited a skin rash or experienced diarrhea. 
“We need to start to telling people what are the key symptoms at different ages rather than this blanket obsession with fever, cough, and lack of smell,” Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King’s College London and co-leader of the project, tells The Guardian. He suggests that children showing these symptoms should be kept home from school, though not necessarily tested.
See “COVID-19 Is ‘Very Different’ in Young Kids Versus Adults”
Sanjay Patel, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Southampton Children’s Hospital in England, cautions that these symptoms are common among many childhood illnesses and could lead parents to unduly quarantine children, which comes with risks. “The harms of that approach are very tangible,” Patel tells The Guardian. “Many children would be missing a lot of school, and the majority of children being tested would still be negative.”
A recent New York Times article, unrelated to the app, comments on how it will be challenging in the coming months for parents to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from those of the common cold. 
“This is not the year to be sending your kid to school sick, even a little bit, even with mild symptoms, which I know is crazy. Because it’s really hard for parents,” Adam Ratner, the director of pediatric infectious diseases at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital in New York, tells the Times. “Sometimes mild symptoms are all we have to go on and kids are really good at shedding the virus, even if they don’t have symptoms.”
Steroid Drugs Are an Effective Treatment for Severe COVID-19: WHO/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DIGICOMPHOTO
D
examethasone and other corticosteroid drugs are effective treatments for seriously ill COVID-19 patients, according to a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials including a total of more than 1,700 participants. The analysis, conducted by a team at the World Health Organization (WHO) and published yesterday (September 2) in JAMA, concluded that the drugs reduced the risk of dying within 28 days compared with standard care or placebo. The organization has issued new guidelines recommending use of the drugs in the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19.
“Steroids are a cheap and readily available medication, and our analysis has confirmed that they are effective in reducing deaths amongst the people most severely affected by Covid-19,” Jonathan Sterne, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Bristol University who helped conduct the meta-analysis, tells The Guardian. “The results were consistent across the trials and show benefit regardless of age or sex.”
Dexamethasone has been in use in hospitals as a COVID-19 treatment for seriously ill patients for several months now, after the UK RECOVERY trial reported in June that the drug reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients ill enough to require mechanical ventilation.
The new meta-analysis reviewed data from this and two other trials of dexamethasone, plus three trials of hydrocortisone and one small study of methylprednisolone. All three drugs are often prescribed by doctors to help dampen inflammation and other immune system responses. They had been proposed as potential COVID-19 treatments partly because patients who die from the disease often succumb to overreactive immune responses.
The WHO has cautioned that the findings do not mean that steroids should be given to all COVID-19 patients, and the organization currently recommends doctors not to prescribe the drugs to people with mild disease. One study included in the meta-analysis found that corticosteroids might even increase mortality in non-severe patients.
See “Insight into Dexamethasone’s Benefits in Severe COVID-19”
It’s still not clear exactly when steroids should be given to patients with worsening disease for the best outcome, Nahid Bhadelia, the medical director of the Special Pathogens Unit at the Boston University School of Medicine, tells STAT.
For patients who don’t yet require oxygen support but maybe be developing an overreactive immune response, “it would be interesting to know if co-administration of an antiviral may help reduce viral load while the earlier steroids work on the inflammatory component,” Bhadelia adds.
COVID-19 Antibodies Last for at Least Four Months After Recovery/-/ABOVE:  A panorama of downtown Reykjavik in Iceland. © ISTOCK.COM, ULTIMA_GAINA
A
study of COVID-19 patients in Iceland represents the largest effort yet to assess the body’s immunological response to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies generated to combat infection peaked in the two months following a positive diagnosis before plateauing for a further two months in more than 90 percent of recovered patients, the authors report.
The findings, published September 1 in the New England Journal of Medicine, partially contradict previous reports of antibodies sharply declining following recovery. The authors witnessed that decline as well, but it was supplanted by a secondary, more stable wave of antibodies. If these antibodies remain protective over time, that would have positive implications for vaccine development and immunity to reinfection.
Two experts who weren’t involved in the study described the behavior of antibodies over time in an accompanying editorial. “The first wave [of antibodies] is generated by early short-lived plasma cells . . . but this wave subsides rapidly after resolution of acute infection. The second wave is generated by a smaller number of longer-lived plasma cells that provide long-lived immunity,” the authors of the editorial report. “A rise and early decay of antibodies was observed in the Icelandic study, but with limited loss of antibodies at later time points, a finding that points to stable SARS-CoV-2 immunity for at least 4 months after infection.”
To arrive at this conclusion, the authors sampled more than 30,000 people—roughly 15 percent of Iceland’s population—beginning in the early days of the pandemic in February and continuing into early July. They split their cohort into three groups: those who had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), people who had been exposed to the virus but not necessarily infected, and those without any known exposure.
Each person was tested using six antibody assays, including two that targeted the entire suite of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies rather than a single type. A person was counted as a positive case if those two “pan-Ig” assays came back positive. 
The current study identified two waves of antibodies associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ©2020
Based on their findings, the authors estimate that roughly 1 percent of the population of Iceland has been infected with COVID-19 since February, with a fatality rate of 0.3 percent, roughly three times that of the seasonal flu, the Associated Press reports.
The researchers used the subset of roughly 1,200 patients who had received a positive diagnosis by qPCR to track their antibodies over time. Within this group, 91 percent had antibody levels that rose during the first two months after diagnosis before plateauing for the following two months.
The editorial cautions that populations or even individuals in other countries may not respond the same way to SARS-CoV-2 infection as in Iceland. Future studies will be needed with more diverse cohorts to see how well their results hold up. “That said, this study provides hope that host immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting and may be similar to that elicited by most other viral infections,” the authors of the editorial say.
The study did not test whether these longer-lived antibodies are protective against reinfection. “What we don’t know is really the million-dollar question: How do these antibodies reflect immunity against this virus and inhibition of this virus,” Jason Kindrachuk, a medical microbiologist at the University of Manitoba who wasn’t involved with the research, tells NBC News. “Just because you see antibodies being produced, it doesn’t tell you that those antibodies are going to act specifically against the virus.” 
Toward COVID-19 Testing Any Time, Anywhere/-/ABOVE: A mockup of the at-home test currently under development by Mammoth Biosciences and GlaxoSmithKline
MAMMOTH BIOSCIENCES
I
n late January, as the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining steam, Charles Chiu, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, reached out to colleagues at San Francisco–based biotech Mammoth Biosciences. Chiu’s group and the team at Mammoth had already collaborated on developing a CRISPR-based diagnostic test for Lyme disease, which they thought would easily translate to SARS-CoV-2 detection, he says.
“The CRISPR system allows you to target pathogens very precisely,” Chiu, who is part of Mammoth’s scientific advisory board, tells The Scientist. “Within two to three weeks, we were able to go from just designing the assay to actually getting it to work and demonstrating that we can use it to rapidly identify or potentially diagnose SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples.”
The gold standard for detecting a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 is reverse transcription PCR, which requires isolation of RNA from a sample followed by the conversion of RNA to DNA and subsequent PCR to amplify any viral nucleic acids. While sensitive, this type of test requires collection of a specimen, such as saliva or a nasal swab, and the transport of that sample to a clinical lab for processing. Earlier in the year, reagents for this type of test were in short supply.
The new assay developed by Chiu and colleagues is called SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR (for SARS-CoV-2 DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter); researchers published details about how it works in Nature Biotechnology on April 16. The test is fast: after RNA extraction, it takes less than an hour to get a result. And it uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), which takes place at just one temperature, rather than the cycling temperatures necessary for PCR, meaning an expensive thermocycler is not required.
The enzyme most commonly used for CRISPR genetic modification is Cas9, which, guided by a short RNA sequence, finds and cleaves a nucleic acid target. DETECTR uses a different enzyme, Cas12, which also follows a guide RNA to its target—in this case, SARS-CoV-2 sequences—but cleaves more than just its target; it also starts chopping up nearby nucleic acids. The assay includes a reporter molecule that, when it gets cleaved by Cas12 during the cutting frenzy precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid recognition, can be visualized on a test strip, similar to a home pregnancy test.  
In their paper, the authors reported that the sensitivity of DETECTR was comparable to a reverse transcription PCR assay run in a clinical lab on about 80 patient samples. On July 9, the assay was given emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only for use at the University of California, San Francisco’s clinical lab. Since then, the developers have continued to focus on making the test more accessible and easier to use.
In the iteration that was approved for EUA, there’s still an RNA extraction step, Chiu explains. That’s a possible issue because “there was a shortage of extraction reagents just a month or two ago, and it’s also limited by the fact that extractions typically take anywhere from a half an hour to an hour, so . . . we ended up modifying this test so that we can actually run the LAMP reaction directly from [an] original sample.”
See “The Push to Deploy At-Home Antigen Tests for COVID-19”
On May 20, Mammoth Biosciences established a partnership with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare to further develop DETECTR into a handheld, disposable device that would be appropriate for home use and be about as expensive as an at-home pregnancy test.
“The way point-of-need and at-home diagnostics will work is if they’re truly all-in-one,” says Trevor Martin, Mammoth Biosciences’s CEO. “It needs to be as easy to use as a pregnancy test, and we’re also very much believers that it needs to give you results that are as trusted and accurate as something you would get in the lab.”
Amplifying without PCR
Since the COVID-19 pandemic started to take off in the US in March, testing has largely focused on people who already have symptoms, partly because resources are limited. The trouble is, it seems as though the virus is most contagious around the time of symptom onset, meaning that if people are waiting to quarantine or take other protective measures until they get a positive result, they may have already infected others.
Testing at the earliest stage of symptoms “is useful from an epidemiological perspective to understand how COVID impacts patients,” says Rahul Dhanda, the CEO of Sherlock Biosciences, a Cambridge, Massachusetts–based biotech that develops diagnostics and is now focusing on SARS-CoV-2. “But in terms of prevention and tracking the history of disease, what you want to do is test people who are asymptomatic.”
Toward the goal of catching more cases before they spread and avoiding supply chain issues, a number of biotechs and academic labs are devising new strategies and exploiting existing technology to make testing simpler and available in settings other than doctors’ offices and clinical labs.
See “Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19”
In a study published in PLOS Pathogens on August 27, for instance, a group based in China described a test that relies on RNA extraction that they call CRISPR-COVID. Their assay leverages Cas13a, an enzyme that behaves similarly to Cas12 to cleave a single-stranded reporter that fluoresces when SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present, and another type of isothermal (constant temperature) amplification, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification. In the study, the authors estimate the cost of one CRISPR-COVID test at about $3.50, but predict it could be as low as $0.70 if the reagents were purchased in bulk. The current version is most appropriate for the lab, as it requires an RNA extraction step and specialized equipment to pick up fluorescent signals.
The fact that you can do a molecular diagnostic test in the palm of your hands is something that has never been possible before.
—Rahul Dhanda, the CEO of Sherlock Biosciences
In a study published August 31 in PNAS, researchers developed a test that uses LAMP directly on patient samples and detects SARS-CoV-2 with a microfluidic cartridge and portable smartphone-based reader. Because it does not require RNA extraction or PCR amplification, “this approach could enable the scalable deployment of COVID-19 diagnostics without laboratory-grade infrastructure and resources, especially in settings where diagnosis is required at the point of collection, such as schools, facilities that care for the elderly or disabled, or sporting events,” the authors write.
The current pandemic is not the first time LAMP has been developed for diagnosing viral infections. Because of its portability, it’s been deployed in Ebola and Zika outbreaks. But the technology is not without drawbacks. “There are a couple of problems with isothermal amplification,” cautions Max Wilson, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Wilson has developed a COVID-19 test in use at UCSB that uses CRISPR for detection and PCR for amplification. “In our hands . . . [LAMP] is less sensitive than other amplification methods,” he explains.
Another problem is that if everyone starts using LAMP, the reagents, which aren’t made at volumes supportive of pandemic-scale testing, could become harder to get, Wilson says. “The production has not been streamlined and optimized.”
Despite these and other issues, “there are a lot of really promising and complementary testing frameworks” out there, he adds. All of the various approaches—at-home testing, lab-based testing of samples taken at healthcare facilities, and assays that could be used to test thousands of people daily, such as in public health departments or at big universities—“don’t even compete for resources or manufacturing capability,” Wilson says, “and they’re all necessary.”
“There’s a huge amount of unmet need” when it comes to COVID-19 testing, Martin agrees. “We just need all hands on deck.”
Leveraging synthetic biology 
Starting in mid-March, Dhanda and his team at Sherlock Biosciences pivoted their entire research program to focus on developing a CRISPR-based COVID-19 test kit using their platform SHERLOCK, which stands for specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking. On May 6, that kit granted EUA and is now distributed in the US through a collaboration with Integrated DNA Technologies.
Because that test still includes a lot of steps, most of which are best performed in a lab, the researchers are now also working on a room-temperature, instrument-free test, the output of which can be visualized on a paper strip. That technology, which is called INSPECTR for internal splint-pairing expression cassette translation reaction, was originally developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and relies on hybridization of a sample, such as saliva, to freeze-dried synthetic DNA complementary to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the sample contains viral RNA, a reporter protein is activated and then can be visualized with the naked eye, making the test a great option for eventual home use.

“The fact that you can do a molecular diagnostic test in the palm of your hands is something that has never been possible before,” says Dhanda, who adds that they are planning to apply for an EUA once development is finished, probably early next year. How much it will cost hasn’t been disclosed, but a company representative tells The Scientist that Sherlock is committed to making the test accessible.
In a study published in Science Advances on August 25, a group of researchers led by University of Albany biomedical engineer Ken Halvorsen also used a synthetic DNA approach to detect viral RNA, both from Zika virus and from SARS-CoV-2. The authors created DNA nanoswitches, small bits of DNA that change their shape in response to binding a target sequence. Because of the shape change, samples that contain viral RNA look different when run during gel electrophoresis than do samples without virus.
“We can use this approach to detect viruses at levels that are relevant for health,” Halvorsen says. The group is now “trying to figure out how we can do a workflow that will allow us to do the whole thing outside of a lab.” Because the test can be performed without enzymes, it already lends itself to streamlining, and they plan to simplify the readout, possibly using some type of cartridge that could be preconstructed, portable, and disposable. “We’re hoping to get the whole process down to under an hour,” he tells The Scientist.
As for competition, “I don’t think that the testing for coronavirus is going to be a winner-take-all situation,” Halvorsen says. “There really need to be lots of different options. And it may turn out that there are many different testing types that all work in different situations,” he adds. “This may not be a short-term problem. We may be testing for years.”

No, the CDC Has Not “Quietly Updated” COVID-19 Death Estimates/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JOHNROB
T
he phrase “only 6%” trended on Twitter over the weekend after a series of posts accused the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of quietly reducing the number of deaths due to COVID-19 from nearly 154,000 to a little more than 9,200, or 6 percent of that initial total.
Several of the posts, which were widely shared across social media networks before being taken down for violating platform policies, were linked to followers of the QAnon conspiracy group. President Donald Trump retweeted at least two, and his senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis linked to an article from the fringe site Gateway Pundit that remains live, The Hill reports.
The first mentions seem to have come from an August 29 Facebook post, according to VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to identify misinformation on the web. That post claimed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had “quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid,” while another post stated more bluntly that the update proved “their numbers are so fucked that they are off by a whopping 94%.” 
The data being discussed were originally shared on August 26 by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is run by the CDC. On that day, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the US was listed as 164,280, although the widely circulated posts included an older estimate of 153,504 deaths. That total has since increased to 182,622 as of August 31.
Under a subheading labeled “comorbidities”—additional conditions people experienced in addition to a primary diagnosis such as COVID-19—the NCHS shared that “for 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned” on a death certificate, meaning that only 6 percent of individuals had no underlying health complications other than COVID-19 reported when they died. The statement continued, “for deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.” 
When a person dies, there can be multiple reasons listed on their death certificate, and in fact, it’s rare for people not to have more than one cause, the Associated Press reports.
This tracks with what is known about the virus, that people with certain conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or asthma are at a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, as are older individuals, who are also more likely to have other health problems.
“A small number of people have COVID ascribed as the sole cause of death. It may be they had no comorbidities or they were just not noted,” Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, tells PolitiFact. “However, it is also clear that advanced age and several other underlying diseases lead to bad outcomes with COVID infections. The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID.” 
Mark Halstead, a sports team physician at Washington University, described a hypothetical scenario in a Facebook post on August 30. Someone coming to the hospital with COVID-19 would certainly have the virus listed as a primary diagnosis, but if they then required a ventilator, respiratory failure would also be listed as a cause of death. If a person were to decline to such an extent that they went into cardiac arrest and died, that too would be listed on a death certificate. “The COVID infection started the process but that led to the heart and lungs failing, which killed that person,” Halstead says.
The misleading tweets and Facebook posts come at a time when the CDC is being criticized for what some perceive as a tendency to bend to political pressure, The New York Times reports. Last week, the agency released a revised set of testing recommendations stating that people who had been in close contact with someone confirmed to have COVID-19 did not necessarily need to be tested themselves. The resulting backlash caused CDC Director Robert Redfield to walk back the change, saying such individuals “may be considered” for testing, an ambiguity that has left medical professionals unsure of how best to advise their patients. 
When asked at a press briefing on Monday, August 31, if the President was trying to downplay the death toll with the retweets, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, “No, he was highlighting new CDC information that came out that was worth noting.”
Back to School/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, RAWF8
M
y wife and I, like parents across the US and beyond, are grappling with a very difficult situation at the moment: the start of another school year for our children amidst rampant COVID-19 spread in our state and country. Our local school district has decided that its more than 18,000 students will start the 2020–21 school year with a “remote for all” educational model. Kids from 3 to 18 years old, including our preschooler and two elementary school students, will log in to virtual classrooms to meet with teachers, interact with classmates, and follow a curriculum that had to be reenvisioned in the face of the disruption and forced flexibility wrought by the ongoing pandemic.
We followed along intently via livestreamed meetings as our district school board hashed out the details of the coming academic year, hoping that evidence-based thinking and appropriately proportioned risk avoidance would guide its decisions. By and large that was the case, and our board heeded warnings and guidance from state and federal public health agencies. Other schools, including private schools in our area, have chosen to invite teachers, students, and staff members back into classrooms with precautions designed to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frankly, I feel for the cohort that is returning to schools in person this fall. Especially for teachers, who are perennially underappreciated, underpaid, and overworked, being forced back into the classroom seems to add insult to historical injury. In effect, they must choose between their vocation and their health, between the needs of their students and the safety of themselves and their loved ones.
My consternation arises from facts on the ground. In Israel, schools across the nation returned to in-person instruction in late May. Within days, one Jerusalem high school reported that 154 students and 26 staff members had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infections rippled into their communities. Eli Waxman, a researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science and chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council on reopening schools, shared some advice in early August for other countries weighing the benefits and drawbacks of opening schools. “They definitely should not do what we have done,” he told The New York Times. “It was a major failure.” 
ANDRZEJ KRAUZE
Israel made its decision to reopen at a time when the country was reporting fewer than 100 new infections per day. As of this writing (in mid-August), on the eve of many US schools opening their doors, America is seeing an average of more than 56,000 new cases per day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, in Georgia, schools in a suburban district north of Atlanta opened on August 3. By August 12, nearly 1,200 students and staff members had been ordered to quarantine due to COVID-19 outbreaks at more than 10 schools.
I consider these episodes to be clear cautionary tales. Adding to this anecdotal evidence is the evolving science surrounding the susceptibility of young people. Recent research has combated notions of adolescents being less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in fact has suggested that children who contract the virus may carry higher viral loads than adults. To be sure, I am aware of the fact that for children, school is far more than an educational forum. For most, it fulfills vital social needs for peer interaction. And for too many, even for kids within my own district, school offers a respite from abuse, hunger, or an otherwise chaotic or uncertain home life. Taking away that refuge represents something much more dangerous than a delay or alteration in the educational process.
But for the millions engaging in virtual learning this semester, I am hopeful that parents, students, and teachers can view the situation in a light that extends beyond the obvious disruption to education as usual. I am hopeful that my own kids and others in their classes will cultivate valuable skills and thought patterns as they navigate the technological and social realities before them. After all, even before the pandemic changed so much about life in 2020, the world was becoming ever more connected, virtual, and off-site. There is a strong probability that the next generation will be learning or working remotely in their lifetimes. So at the start of another school year, one that none of us will soon forget, I commend staff members, teachers, school board members, students, and parents who are braving our new normal, and urge them to see the positive in this difficult situation.

Science and Policy Collide During the Pandemic/-/ABOVE: MODIFIED FROM © ISTOCK.COM, VASELENA
S
cience has taken center stage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, as SARS-CoV-2 started spreading around the globe, many researchers pivoted to focus on studying the virus. At the same time, some scientists and science advisors—experts responsible for providing scientific information to policymakers—gained celebrity status as they calmly and cautiously updated the public on the rapidly evolving situation and lent their expertise to help governments make critical decisions, such as those relating to lockdowns and other transmission-slowing measures.
“Academia, in the case of COVID, has done an amazing job of trying to get as much information relevant to COVID gathered and distributed into the policymaking process as possible,” says Chris Tyler, the director of research and policy in University College London’s Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP). 
But the pace at which COVID-related science has been conducted and disseminated during the pandemic has also revealed the challenges associated with translating fast-accumulating evidence for an audience not well versed in the process of science. As research findings are speedily posted to preprint servers, preliminary results have made headlines in major news outlets, sometimes without the appropriate dose of scrutiny.
Some politicians, such as Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, have been quick to jump on premature findings, publicly touting the benefits of treatments such as hydroxychloroquine with minimal or no supporting evidence. Others have pointed to the flip-flopping of the current state of knowledge as a sign of scientists’ untrustworthiness or incompetence—as was seen, for example, in the backlash against Anthony Fauci, one of the US government’s top science advisors. 
Some comments from world leaders have been even more concerning. “For me, the most shocking thing I saw,” Tyler says, “was Donald Trump suggesting the injection of disinfectant as a way of treating COVID—that was an eye-popping, mind-boggling moment.” 
Still, Tyler notes that there are many countries in which the relationship between the scientific community and policymakers during the course of the pandemic has been “pretty impressive.” As an example, he points to Germany, where the government has both enlisted and heeded the advice of scientists across a range of disciplines, including epidemiology, virology, economics, public health, and the humanities.
Researchers will likely be assessing the response to the pandemic for years to come. In the meantime, for scientists interested in getting involved in policymaking, there are lessons to be learned, as well some preliminary insights from the pandemic that may help to improve interactions between scientists and policymakers and thereby pave the way to better evidence-based policy. 
Cultural divisions between scientists and policymakers
Even in the absence of a public-health emergency, there are several obstacles to the smooth implementation of scientific advice into policy. One is simply that scientists and policymakers are generally beholden to different incentive systems. “Classically, a scientist wants to understand something for the sake of understanding, because they have a passion toward that topic—so discovery is driven by the value of discovery,” says Kai Ruggeri, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. “Whereas the policymaker has a much more utilitarian approach. . . . They have to come up with interventions that produce the best outcomes for the most people.”
Scientists and policymakers are operating on considerably different timescales, too. “Normally, research programs take months and years, whereas policy decisions take weeks and months, sometimes days,” Tyler says. “This discrepancy makes it much more difficult to get scientifically generated knowledge into the policymaking process.” Tyler adds that the two groups deal with uncertainty in very different ways: academics are comfortable with it, as measuring uncertainty is part of the scientific process, whereas policymakers tend to view it as something that can cloud what a “right” answer might be. 
This cultural mismatch has been particularly pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as scientists work at breakneck speeds, many crucial questions about COVID-19—such as how long immunity to the virus lasts, and how much of a role children play in the spread of infection—remain unresolved, and policy decisions have had to be addressed with limited evidence, with advice changing as new research emerges. 
“We have seen the messy side of science, [that] not all studies are equally well-done and that they build over time to contribute to the weight of knowledge,” says Karen Akerlof, a professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University. “The short timeframes needed for COVID-19 decisions have run straight into the much longer timeframes needed for robust scientific conclusions.” 
Academia has done an amazing job of trying to get as much information  relevant to COVID gathered and distributed into the policymaking process as possible.

Widespread mask use, for example, was initially discouraged by many politicians and public health officials due to concerns about a shortage of supplies for healthcare workers and limited data on whether mask use by the general public would help reduce the spread of the virus. At the time, there were few mask-wearing laws outside of East Asia, where such practices were commonplace long before the COVID-19 pandemic began.  
Gradually, however, as studies began to provide evidence to support the use of face coverings as a means of stemming transmission, scientists and public health officials started to recommend their use. This shift led local, state, and federal officials around the world to implement mandatory mask-wearing rules in certain public spaces. Some politicians, however, used this about-face in advice as a reason to criticize health experts.  
“We’re dealing with evidence that is changing very rapidly,” says Meghan Azad, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Manitoba. “I think there’s a risk of people perceiving that rapid evolution as science [being] a bad process, which is worrisome.” On the other hand, the spotlight the pandemic has put on scientists provides opportunities to educate the general public and policymakers about the scientific process, Azad adds. It’s important to help them understand that “it’s good that things are changing, because it means we’re paying attention to the new evidence as it comes out.”
Bringing science and policy closer together
Despite these challenges, science and policy experts say that there are both short- and long-term ways to improve the relationship between the two communities and to help policymakers arrive at decisions that are more evidence-based.
Better tools, for one, could help close the gap. Earlier this year, Ruggeri brought together a group of people from a range of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, economics, and policy, to develop the Theoretical, Empirical, Applicable, Replicable, Impact (THEARI) rating system, a five-tiered framework for evaluating the robustness of scientific evidence in the context of policy decisions. The ratings range from “theoretical” (the lowest level, where a scientifically viable idea has been proposed but not tested) to “impact” (the highest level, in which a concept has been successfully tested, replicated, applied, and validated in the real world).
The team developed THEARI partly to establish a “common language” across scientific disciplines, which Ruggeri says would be particularly useful to policymakers evaluating evidence from a field they may know little about. Ruggeri hopes to see the THEARI framework—or something like it—adopted by policymakers and policy advisors, and even by journals and preprint servers. “I don’t necessarily think [THEARI] will be used right away,” he says. “It’d be great if it was, but we . . . [developed] it as kind of a starting point.” 
Other approaches to improve the communication between scientists and policymakers may require more resources and time. According to Akerlof, one method could include providing better incentives for both parties to engage with each other—by offering increased funding for academics who take part in this kind of activity, for instance—and boosting opportunities for such interactions to happen. 
Akerlof points to the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, which place scientists and engineers in various branches of the US government for a year, as an example of a way in which important ties between the two communities could be forged. “Many of those scientists either stay in government or continue to work in science policy in other organizations,” Akerlof says. “By understanding the language and culture of both the scientific and policy communities, they are able to bridge between them.”  
In Canada, such a program was established in 2018, when the Canadian Science Policy Center and Mona Nemer, Canada’s Chief Science Advisor, held the country’s first “Science Meets Parliament” event. The 28 scientists in attendance, including Azad, spent two days learning about effective communication and the policymaking process, and interacting with senators and members of parliament. “It was eye opening for me because I didn’t know how parliamentarians really live and work,” Azad says. “We hope it’ll grow and involve more scientists and continue on an annual basis . . . and also happen at the provincial level.”
There may also be insights from scientist-policymaker exchanges in other domains that experts can apply to the current pandemic. Maria Carmen Lemos, a social scientist focused on climate policy at the University of Michigan, says that one way to make those interactions more productive is by closing something she calls the “usability gap.”
The short timeframes needed for COVID-19 decisions have run straight into the much longer timeframes needed for robust scientific conclusions.
 —Karen Akerlof, George Mason University
“The usability gap highlights the fact that one of the reasons that research fails to connect is because [scientists] only pay attention to the [science],” Lemos explains. “We are putting everything out there in papers, in policy briefs, in reports, but rarely do we actually systematically and intentionally try to understand who is on the other side” receiving this information, and what they will do with it.
The way to deal with this usability gap, according to Lemos, is for more scientists to consult the people who actually make, influence, and implement policy changes early on in the scientific process. Lemos and her team, for example, have engaged in this way with city officials, farmers, forest managers, tribal leaders, and others whose decision making would directly benefit from their work. “We help with organization and funding, and we also work with them very closely to produce climate information that is tailored for them, for the problems that they are trying to solve,” she adds. 
Azad applied this kind of approach in a study that involves assessing the effects of the pandemic on a cohort of children that her team has been following from infancy, starting in 2010. When she and her colleagues were putting together the proposal for the COVID-19 project this year, they reached out to public health decision makers across the Canadian provinces to find out what information would be most useful. “We have made sure to embed those decision makers in the project from the very beginning to ensure we’re asking the right questions, getting the most useful information, and getting it back to them in a very quick turnaround manner,” Azad says. 
There will also likely be lessons to take away from the pandemic in the years to come, notes Noam Obermeister, a PhD student studying science policy at the University of Cambridge. These include insights from scientific advisors about how providing guidance to policymakers during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic times, and how scientists’ prominent role during the pandemic has affected how they are viewed by the public; efforts to collect this sort of information are already underway. 
“I don’t think scientists anticipated that much power and visibility, or that [they] would be in [public] saying science is complicated and uncertain,” Obermeister says. “I think what that does to the authority of science in the public eye is still to be determined.”
Talking Science to Policymakers
For academics who have never engaged with policymakers, the thought of making contact may be daunting. Researchers with experience of these interactions share their tips for success.
1. Do your homework. Policymakers usually have many different people vying for their time and attention. When you get a meeting, make sure you make the most of it. “Find out which issues related to your research are a priority for the policymaker and which decisions are on the horizon,” says Karen Akerlof, a professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University.
2. Get to the point, but don’t oversimplify. “I find policymakers tend to know a lot about the topics they work on, and when they don’t, they know what to ask about,” says Kai Ruggeri, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. “Finding a good balance in the communication goes a long way.”
3. Keep in mind that policymakers’ expertise differs from that of scientists. “Park your ego at the door and treat policymakers and their staff with respect,” Akerlof says. “Recognize that the skills, knowledge, and culture that translate to success in policy may seem very different than those in academia.” 
4. Be persistent. “Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get a response immediately, or if promising communications don’t pan out,” says Meghan Azad, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Manitoba. “Policymakers are busy and their attention shifts rapidly. Meetings get cancelled. It’s not personal. Keep trying.”
5. Remember that not all policymakers are politicians, and vice versa. Politicians are usually elected and are affiliated with a political party, and they may not always be directly involved in creating new policies. This is not the case for the vast majority of policymakers—most are career civil servants whose decisions impact the daily living of constituents, Ruggeri explains. 
U of Illinois Returns to School with 20,000 Saliva Tests Per Day/-/ABOVE: An individual submits a saliva test at the University of Illinois
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
T
he University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign announced in June that when students, faculty, and staff returned to campus for the fall semester, every individual would undergo rapid saliva testing for COVID-19 twice a week in order to swiftly quell any outbreaks. To process the 20,000 tests conducted each day, the university repurposed its veterinary lab. To take the test, a person only needs to spit into a tube, then the sample is heated for 30 minutes and scientists add chemical reagents to prepare the sample for RT-qPCR. Each test costs $10. The school budgeted $6 million for startup costs and up to $10 million for testing throughout the semester. 
The initiative is supported by a cell phone app that immediately notifies individuals of their test results and can alert them if they’ve been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. Those who test positive are quarantined. Now, that plan is being put in place as school is getting underway.
See “Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19”
The Scientist spoke with Martin Burke, a chemist at the university who helped develop the saliva test, about how the initiative has gone so far.
The Scientist: First, can you tell me about the tests that you developed that you’re using to do this mass testing?
Martin Burke: Sure. So back in April, we launched a project to try to figure out how to stand up and strategically deploy standard testing as part of the university’s effort to reopen as safely as possible. And we quickly realized that the standard nasal swab viral transfer media RNA isolation was not going to be sufficient. [It would be] too slow, too expensive, and have too many supply chain bottlenecks. So I teamed up with my colleague Paul Hergenrother [another chemist at the university] and launched kind of a Manhattan Project–style effort to find a way to test cheaper, faster, and without the supply chain bottlenecks.
Paul led an extraordinary team of students and postdocs and a bunch of us together and found we could skip the RNA isolation step, go directly from saliva to PCR, and thereby get rid of most of the supply chain bottlenecks, dramatically increase the speed, and reduce the cost. This is the backbone of the programs.
TS: Can you describe a little bit about the program itself, how it’s set up?
MB: The testing itself is not a silver bullet—we wrap around it frontier data science to figure out who to test and how frequently to repeat it. And then on the backend [we have] rapid communication to a new app that was created for the phone by Bill Sullivan and his team so that you get your results immediately pushed straight to your phone in a HIPAA-complaint and fully privacy-protected manner as well as digital exposure notifications. So between all of that is this test. And we had to get to 20,000 tests per day in order to be able to meet the demand of twice per week for 60,000 people. I’m very excited to tell you we achieved that.
TS: And what have you seen so far?
MB: We ran a pilot over the summer with all the student staff who were here. And actually in mid-July, we had a spike. There was a social event that led to an increase. But then by just having frequent testing across the summer, over the next two weeks, we watched it fall down so I think that was our first indication that this really had a shot.
We knew we were going to get a bump when all the students came back. We got it, just as we predicted with the modeling. And I’m so excited to tell you, we’re watching it fall as we do the frequent repeat testing on the population right now. We really hope that this is going to continue to show a way which we could get society reopened.
TS: Now that everybody’s back, how are they responding to the strategy?
MB: So far, we’ve seen a remarkable level of compliance. The goal, of course, is to help people get safely isolated, help people get safely quarantined. A lot of them don’t mind it so much because they get free food and lots of support and they get a care package. We don’t want to make it feel like they’ve done something wrong, we just want to make everyone feel safe and protected.
We talk to business owners to try to create a true understanding of how important and exciting this is, an opportunity to invest in staying open. So, for example, the community voluntarily imposed a shutdown of indoor bars and restaurants for a two- to three-week period as the students came back to try to avoid superspreader events.
I was really excited to see this driving home the other night [as I] passed a fraternity house. The guys had brought out their ping pong table, out on the front yard with their masks on playing ping pong. And I’ll tell you, that is when I knew we were going to make it.

Modeling Study Flags Species Susceptible to SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: Western lowland gorilla
SKIP BROWN/SMITHSONIAN’S NATIONAL ZOO AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY INSTITUTE
A
n international team of scientists has assessed the fit for the main cellular attachment point of SARS-CoV-2 in 410 species of vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to categorize those most susceptible to viral entry. The computational study, published in PNAS Monday (August 24), predicts that several critically endangered primate species are at very high risk of the virus, although the results need to be confirmed with further experiments or surveillance.
The receptor for the virus—angiotensin converting enzyme-2, or ACE2—is found in many types of cells and tissues, including in the nose, mouth, and lungs of people. The spike protein that studs the exterior of the viral particle can be compared to a key, ACE2 a lock.
In people, 25 amino acids of the enzyme are important for the virus to gain entry into cells. The scientists behind this latest study used these amino acid sequences to evaluate how suitable the ACE2 protein is for SARS-CoV-2 in other species, for which high quality sequence data for ACE2 existed.
The researchers developed an index that weighted overall amino acid similarity with the residues in human ACE2 known to be important for binding SARS-CoV-2, says senior author Harris Lewin of the University of California, Davis.
The results spotlighted primates such as the Western lowland gorilla, Sumatran orangutan, chimpanzee, and bonobo as at very high risk of infection. This was not unexpected, given that their ACE2 sequence is identical to our own. Monkeys, which are mostly also pegged as very high risk, are known to be vulnerable to COVID-19 and have been used to study the disease, allowing scientists to ask questions about immune memory. Primate facilities have been taking steps since early on in the pandemic to protect their animals from the disease.
The second category (high risk) contained a few surprises, such as three deer species, muskrat, Chinese hamster, and Gambian pouched rat. The similarities for many of these evolutionarily distant taxa “is just an evolutionary quirk,” says Lewin. Also in that category were numerous marine mammals, such as the gray whale, minke whale, harbour porpoise, killer whale, narwhal, and common bottlenose dolphin.
A new genomic study from UC Davis ranks the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to bind to the ACE2 receptor site in 410 vertebrate animals.

If there is an intermediate species between bats and humans it is likely in the two highest risk categories, which include fewer than 100 species, according to Lewin. He is especially interested in hamsters having compatible ACE2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and says wild hamsters might be worth investigating as possible intermediate hosts for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans. Indeed, the Syrian hamster has recently been shown to be a good model for COVID-19 research.
Domestic animals such as cats, cattle, and sheep were at medium risk, and dogs, horses, and pigs were at low risk for ACE2 binding. “Ferrets and mink were in the low risk category, and they have been shown to be susceptible experimentally,” says Lewin. “There’s something we don’t understand about those species.”
It could be that the virus uses a receptor other than ACE2, or that even low-affinity connections and high viral dose can lead to infection. Lewin says the next step now is to infect cells of various species with the virus and to do careful challenge studies with live animals.
“What’s nice is that they looked at a wide range of different species,” says Fabian Leendertz, an infectious disease scientist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. He warns that the results give hints of susceptibility, rather than solid evidence to guide management decisions for places such as zoos. Actual risks can only be confirmed with additional experimental results.
Leendertz was unsurprised that great apes are susceptible, and had warned in March that they are at risk from COVID-19.
Another research group investigated the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection of 35 marine mammals, again based on how well their ACE2 interacts with the viral spike protein in computer models. They predicted that 15 species would be susceptible.
These studies “cannot predict the outcome of infection, but can predict susceptibility to infection,” explains Graham Dellaire, a molecular biologist at Dalhousie University in Canada, who coauthored the study, posted to bioRxiv August 14. “There are also mitigating circumstances that can make the infection worse or milder in any given organism.” For example, some species might not have ACE2 enzymes in nasopharynx or lung tissues, critical locations for COVID-19 infection and transmission in humans.
For many species, wild or in captivity, it would not be ethical or appropriate to infect them with SARS-CoV-2 in order to observe the outcome. Instead, studies of the ACE2 receptor can flag which species we need to be monitored as potentially vulnerable to infection. It can also inspire cell infectivity experiments.
“We should be more aware in the context of zoos and aquariums about human interactions with these animals,” says Dellaire. “In zoos, we don’t know the consequences of animals getting infected. It could be mild or it could be multi-organ necrosis.” Those who come into close contact with wild animals should also take precautions.
Dellaire warns that sewage discharge into marine environments could expose marine mammals to SARS-CoV-2. There’s some evidence that the virus might survive for more than 10 days at sea, he adds, and contaminated wastewater could concentrate in tidal pools.
RNA from the virus can be detected in wastewater and has even been suggested as a way of monitoring COVID-19 in communities. Lewin says cruise ships need to take extra precautions in discharging sewage at sea.
Many mammal species live in groups, which heightens the risks for them. “Whales and dolphins are in pods and are highly social. With one animal infected, the virus could spread and then adapt and remain in that population,” Dellaire warns. 
Is a Bradykinin Storm Brewing in COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: A hyperactive bradykinin system permits fluid, shown in yellow, to leak out of a blood vessel and allows immune cells, shown in purple, to squeeze out as well.
JASON SMITH/ORNL, US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
O
n a Sunday afternoon in mid-April this year, Daniel Jacobson, a computational systems biologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, was looking at gene expression data from the lung fluid of COVID-19 patients on his computer screen when he spotted something striking—the expression of genes for key enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), involved in blood pressure regulation and fluid balance, was askew.
Jacobson followed this abnormal RAS in the lung fluid samples to the kinin cascade, an inflammatory pathway that is tightly regulated by the RAS. He found that the kinin system—in which a key peptide, bradykinin, causes blood vessels to leak and fluid to accumulate in tissues and organs—was thrown out of balance as well in COVID-19 patients. Infected individuals showed heightened expression of genes for the bradykinin receptors, as well as for enzymes called kallikreins that activate the kinin pathway, compared with controls.
The results, published July 7 in eLife, could perhaps explain the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs that is so common in COVID-19 patients, the authors say.
Unbeknownst to Jacobson, Frank van de Veerdonk, an infectious disease specialist at the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, was heading down the same molecular pathway in mid-March. He had noticed two features in COVID-19 patients in his clinic—fluid in the lungs and inflammation. Because other labs had pegged angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a key enzyme in the RAS, as being the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and because he knew that ACE2 regulates the kinin system, van de Veerdonk began connecting the dots. In April, he and his group hypothesized that a dysregulated bradykinin system was leading to leaky blood vessels in the lungs and perhaps causing excess fluid to build up.
See “Receptors for SARS-CoV-2 Present in Wide Variety of Human Cells”
Josef Penninger, director of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who discovered that ACE2 is the essential in vivo receptor for SARS, tells The Scientist that he is convinced that bradykinin plays a role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. “It does make a lot of sense.”
He adds that Jacobson’s study lends support to the hypothesis, but further confirmation is needed. “Gene expression signatures don’t tell us the whole story. I think it is very important to actually measure the proteins.”
van de Veerdonk recognizes that peptide levels need to be measured and is currently setting up mass spectrometry to measure kinins in the plasma, which have a half-life in plasma of just a few seconds.
In the meantime, Jacobson and his coauthors advocate in their paper for targeting the bradykinin pathway to counter the excess fluid present in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. As there are already a couple of approved drugs that can interfere with the kinin pathway, doctors have begun deploying them in a number of clinical trials.
Decoding the bradykinin inflammatory pathway in COVID-19
A common theme that underpins many of the disease manifestations of COVID-19, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is inflammation and edema, or fluid build-up. An assorted cast of leaky blood vessels, immune cells (as well as the cytokines and other molecules produced by them), and plasma proteins such as clotting factors, bradykinin, and other kinins assume center stage in this spectacle of acute inflammation.
Activation of the kinin system in the context of blood clotting—which can be dysregulated in some COVID-19 patients—generates bradykinin and related peptides through two distinct pathways: the plasma kallikrein pathway (activated by a clotting factor called the Hageman factor) and the tissue kallikrein pathway (activated by tissue enzymes and plasmin, an enzyme in the fibrinolytic system that breaks down clots in the bloodstream). Bradykinin is then converted to des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK). When bradykinin and DABK bind to their corresponding receptors, B2R and B1R, respectively, fluid begins to leak from blood vessels.
The leaky blood vessels and lung fluid build-up in some COVID-19 patients might be explained by the virus’s corruption of an inflammation safeguard, namely, ACE2’s degradation of DABK. Read the full description of the pathway here.
THE SCIENTIST STAFF
The RAS pathway tightly controls the kinin system. ACE breaks down bradykinin, while ACE2 breaks down DABK. ACE and ACE2 therefore act as regulatory brakes in the kinin system. But because ACE2 combines with SARS and SARS-CoV-2 and is internalized into the cell during infection, extracellular levels of the enzyme might drop, and, according to van de Veerdonk’s hypothesis, the bradykinin cascade then goes into overdrive.
See “Could Curbing Runaway Immune Responses Curb COVID-19?”
“As part of the explanation of COVID pathophysiology, it makes perfect sense, but it’s one piece of a very large and complex puzzle and it only partly helps us explain and understand better a very difficult disease,” says David Fedson, a retired general internist who is interested in developing treatments for pathogens that cause pandemics. Now it’s up to physicians to connect the dots and ask, “how is that meaningful and what can I do about it?—which is the most important question.”
Penninger, who is the founder of a company that is testing ACE2 as a treatment for lung failure in a Phase 2 trial in COVID-19 patients, agrees. 
Targeting the bradykinin pathway in COVID
Currently, there are two approved drugs that target the kinin system: icatibant (a B2R blocker) and the monoclonal antibody lanadelumab, which inhibits plasma kallikrein (there are no drugs yet approved that inhibit tissue kallikrein). van de Veerdonk contends that targeting the kinin system early in the disease, soon after a patient is hospitalized, and is hypoxic, but hasn’t yet developed ARDS, might be helpful.
That is what his group found in a small exploratory study published this month. COVID-19 patients taking icatibant showed marked improvement in oxygenation as evidenced by a substantial decrease in need for supplemental oxygen, compared to control patients.
Allen Kaplan, a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina and an expert on bradykinin who was not connected with the study, tells The Scientist that this preliminary observation supports the idea that icatibant might be helpful “and should therefore be studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion [in COVID patients].”
Another multicenter randomized clinical trial in the US is testing icatibant in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the ICU.
A clinical trial in Cleveland is testing lanadelumab in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.
van de Veerdonk’s group is also testing the plasma kallikrein inhibitor (which is being supplied by Takeda, a company that also manufactures icatibant) in a multicenter clinical trial in the Netherlands in hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving supplemental oxygen, to see whether the drug decreases the need for oxygen.
If all goes well for van de Veerdonk and his team, lanadelumab will be integrated into the REMAP-CAP trial that is evaluating several drugs for community-acquired pneumonia in thousands of patients across several countries and includes COVID-19 patients in one arm.
Kaplan has his reservations, and notes that using the monoclonal antibody against plasma kallikrein in COVID-19 could be interesting, but if it turns out that tissue kallikrein is more important in the disease, it won’t work.
Clarification (August 27): The seventh paragraph initially indicated that van de Veerdonk is currently using mass spectrometry to measure kallikreins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients and that it was impossible to do the same for bradykinin, which has a half-life in plasma of just a few seconds. This has now been changed to clarify that van de Veerdonk is currently setting up mass spectrometry to measure kinins in the plasma, which have a very short half-life.

nterplay between the kinin pathway, which mediates acute inflammation; the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which regulates blood pressure and fluid balance; and macrophages, immune cells that are activated in infection, leads to leaky blood vessels and inflammation in some cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Researchers propose that the kinin cascade—in which bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK) are major proteins—goes into overdrive to cause these effects during COVID-19. Ordinarily, the RAS—in which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are key enzymes—keeps the kinin cascade under control. ACE breaks down the protein bradykinin, preventing it from binding to its receptor B2R, while ACE2 degrades DABK and stops it from binding to B1R. When SARS-CoV-2 hooks up with ACE2 as a means of entering cells, some of the brakes are removed, according to the model, thereby permitting DABK to bind to its receptor and trigger blood vessel leakage and inflammation.
Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which in turn induce B1R to amplify the inflammatory milieu seen in COVID-19.

Thousands of Coronavirus Infections Stemmed from a Biotech Event/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JUSUN

n February of this year, more than 100 leaders of the drug company Biogen met in Boston. Among them was at least one person infected with COVID-19. 
While the Massachusetts Department of Public Health initially identified 97 cases linked to the conference through contact tracing, a new study detailing the genomes of viruses collected from the Greater Boston area indicates that the gathering may have led to more than 20,000 cases across four counties.
The authors of the study arrived at the new count using what Bronwyn MacInnis, an infectious disease researcher at the Broad Institute and the senior author of the paper, describes to the Associated Press as “a pretty unsophisticated, back-of-the envelope calculation.” The total does not appear in the paper, posted August 25 on the preprint server medRxiv, but her coauthor Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Boston Globe, “I’m confident that the scale for measuring this event is in the tens of thousands.”
In late February, when the conference began, Vice President Mike Pence was just forming his coronavirus task force, there were a few dozen COVID-19 cases identified in the US, and the authors stress that they are not faulting Biogen. In a prepared statement sent to The Washington Post, Biogen shared that they had followed all necessary precautions available at the time and immediately reported each case to health officials.
Shortly after people began falling ill, employees at Biogen realized they had an opportunity to “offer their own anonymized medical information to research efforts,” Maha Radhakrishnan, the chief medical officer at Biogen, told The Scientist in an email in May. “We realized we were in a unique position to contribute to advancing COVID-19 science in an organized and deliberate way.”
Their medical information became part of one of the most comprehensive viral genome studies to emerge out of the pandemic. The research team, which included more than 50 scientists and public health officials from around Massachusetts, analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 pulled from 772 patients. Almost all were from Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts who had visited a hospital or clinic between January and May, the Globe reports, including 28 people identified in the initial 97 cases linked to the conference.
See “Biogen Uses its Own Superspreader Event to Aid COVID-19 Research”
As a virus replicates, it accumulates small, often insignificant changes to its genetic code. Scientists identified a single mutation common in the virus of those who attended the conference, a mutation they named C2416T for its location along the genome and the two nucleic acids, cytosine (C) and uracil (the T is for thymine, which replaces RNA’s uracil in DNA), that were switched.
The authors found this mutation in 289 patients—more than one-third of all the people they looked at—far outstripping the number of people who had attended the conference. In fact, those 289 genomes represent 3 percent of all the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in the entire United States, according to the Post. 
A large percentage of these cases stemmed from local homeless individuals taking refuge in shelters and the employees who worked there, a finding that Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute and one of the lead researchers on the study, calls jaw-dropping. “It was the realization that these events really affect the most vulnerable among us,” Sabeti tells The Post. It’s unknown how the virus jumped from the conference to those living on the streets of Boston.
The researchers also identified another 79 unique variants of SARS-CoV-2 that had been introduced into Boston, mostly from other US states or from western Europe, the authors report. And just as variants pour into an area, so they spread outward. In addition to the local cases, the molecular signature of the Biogen outbreak has been found in patients in Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, New Jersey, Washington, DC, and overseas, according to the Globe.
“This is the kind of study that . . . defines why genomics can be so useful in outbreak reconstruction,” Vaughn Cooper, a microbiologist at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the study, tells the Globe. “It reflects a great deal of coordinating work, and that’s what in part makes this so powerful."
Outside experts have also largely accepted the team’s estimation of how many cases may be attributable to the conference. Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, tells the Globe she has no problem believing a single event could cause 20,000 cases. “Super-spreading is really a key component of how we ended up with an epidemic of this gravity,” she says.
Similarly, Dan Hartl, a population geneticist at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, tells the Globe that he found the estimate of 20,000 cases credible, “although I grant you it’s eye-popping.” 
The authors have been quick to urge that there is nothing particularly special about the C2416T variant that makes it more powerful than other strains. “Some [viral] introductions fizzle out, others light fires,” MacInnis tells the Globe. “The circumstances of this event?the fact that it happened so early in the epidemic and the timing of where we were with COVID in the public consciousness?meant it had a disproportionate effect.”

octors have reported the first confirmed cases of individuals who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection a second time. The first report was of a patient in Hong Kong, followed by two patients from Europe, Reuters reports.
Toward the end of March, a 33-year-old Hong Kong man came down with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms before his full recovery a couple of weeks later, The Washington Post reports. After traveling to Spain over the summer, he tested positive in mid-August upon returning to Hong Kong. Although he was asymptomatic, he quarantined in the hospital. Genetic testing showed that he became reinfected with a different strain of the novel coronavirus than the first time.
Two Europeans, one from Belgium and one from the Netherlands, are also reported to have been reinfected. The Belgian woman first tested positive in March and again in June, while not much information about the Dutch patient is known, other than the individual is older and immunocompromised.
Some experts have told news outlets that they were not surprised by patients experiencing repeated infections, especially because the illness was not as severe the second time, and many are wondering what this means for the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine.
“What we are learning from this new case report is that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global population, similar to other common cold-associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have some degree of acquired immunity,” Robert Glatter, an ER doctor in New York City, says to the Post in reference to the Hong Kong patient.
While the patient’s immune response likely prevented him from getting sick the second time around, there is no guarantee the same would occur with a future vaccine. Glatter notes that, like exposure to other coronaviruses, a vaccine “may not be able to provide lifelong immunity,” and might require booster shots.
A study on the Hong Kong patient has been accepted for publication in Clinical Infectious Diseases. It is not clear if those who test positive a second time are capable of shedding the virus and affecting others.
According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 23.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe. It’s not clear how many cases of asymptomatic reinfection have occurred.
“This might happen more often than we think,” Mark Slifka, an immunologist at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, tells Science News. “But no one’s swabbing people on a routine basis when they’re healthy.”
Some COVID-19 Patients Lack Key Structures for Antibody Creation/-/ABOVE: Post-mortem thoracic lymph nodes of a COVID-19 patient (left) lack clusters of Bcl-6–bearing T cells and B cells (stained in yellow), which populate the germinal centers and are clearly visible in a healthy control patient who died of other causes (right).

hen our immune system encounters a new virus—say, SARS-CoV-2—for the first time, some of our plasmablast B cells will release a first flush of antibodies that can stick to and even neutralize the virus. But those first antibodies are short-lived, typically don’t stick very strongly, and the cells that produce them don’t last longer than a few weeks.
As reinforcement, the immune system has a program in place to create long-lived plasma cells that secrete even better, more–tightly binding antibodies. This takes place in the germinal center, a transient, complex structure in the lymph nodes and spleen. There, different B cells gather and undergo a process that’s best described as evolution on the fast track. They rapidly proliferate while deliberately introducing random mutations to certain genes encoding antibodies, increasing the chances of producing a few clones that can squelch the virus.
A type of T cell picks and chooses progeny with promising antibodies, while killing the less useful ones or directing them back for improvement—a cycle of refinement and selection that culminates in the creation of long-lived, plasma B cells that can protect us against re-infection for years, and also memory B cells, which last for even longer. Without germinal centers, the body cannot make lasting antibody immunity to pathogens.
Some severely affected COVID-19 patients entirely lack those structures, according to a post-mortem analysis of lymph and spleen tissue published last week (August 19) in Cell. The authors posit this could be due to high levels of a certain cytokine, TNF-α, which impairs the differentiation of the follicular helper T cells that are required for these germinal center reactions. Although it’s still unclear if asymptomatic or mildly affected COVID-19 patients induce better germinal center responses, the findings help explain why antibody-based immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may be relatively short-lived.
The study “suggests an explanation for a very big problem,” says Ziv Shulman of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who wasn’t involved in the study. “The strength is that it’s not a model—we’re looking at the real disease.”
As a group that has previously studied germinal centers and B cell development, it was only natural for immunologist Shiv Pillai of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard and his colleagues to investigate the sites in COVID-19 patients where germinal centers would be expected to form. They examined the thoracic lymph nodes and spleens of 11 COVID-19 patients who had died of severe infection between March and May this year at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.
All of them had these weird cells.

Yet when they stained the tissue with different markers typical of germinal centers, they found no signs of the antibody-producing depots. This was in contrast to thoracic lymph nodes and spleens from people who had died of other causes. All of the control patients had germinal centers, likely because of ongoing immunity to harmless pathogens they carried.
“The thing you’d expect to see is loaded germinal centers,” Pillai says of the COVID-19 patients. But the absence of the structures wasn’t a complete surprise. Since April, several studies have reported antibodies in COVID-19 patients that don’t show the characteristically heavy mutational signature one would expect if they had stemmed from a germinal center. In addition, some autopsy reports of patients who died during the original SARS outbreak in 2003 found that germinal centers were absent there as well, notes Pillai, who’s on the scientific advisory board of the Massachusetts-based antibody therapeutics company Abpro and soon-to-launch Delaware-based B cell engineering startup Pulsar Biopharma.
In their tissue analyses of COVID-19 patients, Pillai’s team also documented a striking reduction of a particular kind of B cell that typically populates the germinal centers and produces the marker Bcl-6. This was accompanied by a lack of Bcl-6–bearing follicular helper T cells, which are important for kick-starting the formation of the germinal center as well as selecting promising B cells there. The team surmised that the cytokine TNF-α, which was in unusually high concentrations around the would-be location of the germinal center, could be blocking the differentiation of T cells into Bcl-6 follicular helper T cells, thereby preventing the formation of germinal centers. In mouse models of malaria in which germinal center reactions are defective, it’s known that blocking the cytokine can restore functional germinal centers.
The immune systems of these patients may be taking an alternate route to create antibodies. The team found a preponderance of another type of B cell in the lymph nodes and spleens of COVID-19 patients, so-called double-negative B cells, which have been linked to autoimmunity and other pathological conditions. These are capable of creating antibody-secreting cells, but not the kind needed for long-term antibody immunity, notes Ankur Singh, an immune engineer at Georgia Tech who wasn’t involved in the research. “It’s a very useful study in terms of understanding how the virus is impacting critically ill people,” he adds.
To Shulman, the absence of germinal centers in COVID-19 patients who died—whose immune systems weren’t capable of mounting an effective immune response—isn’t surprising. A key question is, “can we learn something from that about patients who don’t die or even asymptomatic [people] . . . about long-lasting immunity?”
Pillai’s team also conducted an analysis of blood from 68 living COVID-19 patients, spanning moderately ill, severely ill, and recovered patients. Upon analyzing the patients’ cells, they found that the double-negative cells and other B cell subtypes that are typically generated outside the germinal center—including ones that were specific to SARS-CoV-2—were prominent across moderately and severely affected patients. “All of them had these weird cells,” Pillai says.
Although not proof that the inability to form germinal centers is a widespread phenomenon in COVID-19, Pillai says he suspects that could be possible, even in mild cases. Most SARS-CoV-2 antibodies documented so far exhibit a very small degree of hypermutation, also among mild cases, which is suggestive that they didn’t arise from a germinal center. If a failure to produce germinal centers is common, then so too would be re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, and that could have implications for the ability to reach herd immunity through natural infection, the authors suggest. However, it wouldn’t have any bearing on a vaccine, because vaccination typically generates good germinal centers, Pillai says.
COVID-19 is a continuum of severity and symptoms, Singh says, and one would expect something like germinal center formation to fall somewhere on that spectrum as well. “It’s quite possible that patients that have less severe disease may induce better germinal center reactions.” In addition, some research has found a few mutated antibodies among the predominantly unmutated ones in people who have recovered from COVID-19, which means that “germinal center activity must take place to some extent,” Shulman adds.
Both Singh and Shulman say they would like to see more research on the underlying mechanisms. It’s not clear, for instance, why TNF-α—one of several cytokines elevated in COVID-19—might have this effect, and whether it’s the only cause of absent germinal centers. “I think that conclusion cannot be made from this particular study,” Singh says. It’s also very hard to disentangle whether it’s a defect in the follicular T helper cells, or a B cell defect, that impairs the germinal center response, Shulman adds. “It’s very hard to say because the cells depend on one another.”
Other mechanisms are possible, Shulman notes. The antibodies initially formed in COVID-19 patients, although they don’t stem from the germinal center, are relatively high-affinity antibodies and are often capable of neutralizing the virus. It’s feasible that because the initial antibodies are good enough, the immune system doesn’t proceed with germinal center reactions, and makes do with antibodies that don’t provide long-lasting protection. Figuring out how the germinal center is disrupted is something that requires animal studies, Shulman notes.
To that end, Pillai is currently trying to model mild COVID-19 in mice to investigate these questions. As for the question of long-term immunity, he says, “time will tell. We have to follow patients up for a while, and that’s what we’ll do.”

FDA Gives Plasma Go-Ahead to Treat COVID-19, Experts Skeptical/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, NIKOLA STOJADINOVIC
P
resident Donald Trump announced yesterday (August 23) that the US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19, a disease that has so far killed more than 170,000 people in the US.
“To deliver treatments and vaccines, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government,” Trump said at a press conference announcing the decision. “Based on the science and the data the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.”
While he hailed the new treatment as a “major breakthrough,” the scientific community has largely reacted with skepticism, in part because the authorization was based on a handful of studies from the Mayo Clinic that failed to include appropriate randomization and controls.
“I watched this in horror,” Eric Topol, a physician and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, tells The Washington Post. “These are basically just exploratory analyses that don’t prove anything. It’s just extraordinary to declare this as a breakthrough. . . . All this does is jeopardize ever getting the truth.”
Harlan Krumholz, the director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale New Haven Hospital, similarly tells STAT the FDA’s decision “raises the question of what strength of evidence is necessary to treat during a pandemic.”
The new authorization stems from both the historical use of plasma as a safe treatment and a series of studies testing the safety of plasma given to COVID-19 patients. The plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies capable of fighting the virus. When administered to those in the grips of the disease, it could in theory help patients survive until their own immune systems can produce the needed antibodies, as has been shown with other diseases. 
In June, the Mayo Clinic released data detailing the safety of plasma given to 20,000 patients, including a high percentage of women and underrepresented minorities. While the results suggested that plasma is safe, the authors reported at the time that “this alone does not provide any evidence on effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19.”
More recently, the Mayo Clinic completed an additional study—released on the preprint server MedRxiv without peer review—involving more than 35,000 additional patients. Adults in the hospital for critical cases of COVID-19 received transfusions of plasma. Those who received the plasma within three days of their diagnosis had a seven-day death rate of 8.7 percent, while those who received the infusion four days after diagnosis died at a rate of 11.9 percent. 
Both studies failed to include a placebo group, making it difficult to assess how well the therapy truly worked. In addition, none were randomized—patients in each study knew they were going to receive plasma.
The Mayo Clinic studies are part of an “expanded access” program launched in April to increase the availability of the treatment rather than to assess its effectiveness. The program, which has ballooned since its inception, has done so in the absence of concrete recommendations from any leading health agency, and there are fears that a run on plasma could use up supplies. US hospitals are currently treating around 1,500 COVID-19 patients a day with blood infusions of plasma, Buzzfeed News reports, totaling more than 70,000 people.
The New York Times reported August 19, prior to the emergency use authorization (EUA), that several experts, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci, urged the FDA to reconsider given the relative weakness of the Mayo Clinic results. “The three of us are pretty aligned on the importance of robust data through randomized control trials, and that a pandemic does not change that,” Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects at NIAID, Clifford Lane, tells The Times.
In response to the FDA’s announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement urging caution over the effectiveness of plasma, Reuters reports. “There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care,” Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, said in a news conference. “Only a few of them have actually reported interim results . . . and at the moment, it’s still very low-quality evidence.”
The FDA acknowledges the limitations of the intervention in the supporting EUA documentation. Denise Hinton, the chief scientist for the FDA, stated, “COVID-19 convalescent plasma should not be considered a new standard of care for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additional data will be forthcoming from other analyses and ongoing, well-controlled clinical trials in the coming months.”
But some experts, including Katharine Bar, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, says she worries the widespread use of plasma will dissuade patients from voluntarily enrolling in these robust clinical trials, where they are randomly assigned to treatment groups that could result in them receiving a placebo. “I just think logistically it’s going to be very challenging,” Bar tells Buzzfeed.

How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Affected Field Research/-/ABOVE: A crew sets sail to Station ALOHA off the coast of Hawaii in August.

T
ears streaked the top of Angelicque White’s cheekbones and soaked her mask in the moments after she had a cotton-tipped stick inserted into her nose to test for the novel coronavirus. “When they shove that swab that far up your nostril, you immediately start crying,” she tells The Scientist. The test, along with a mandatory two-week quarantine leading up to it, was part of a strict protocol White and others followed to be allowed to once again set sail on their research ship and continue to collect data on a massive ocean current in the Pacific. 
Called the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the swirl of seawater, which covers roughly 20 million square kilometers, is the largest ecosystem on Earth and the oldest ecosystem in the ocean, a prime habitat for billions of plants, animals, and microbes. Scientists have studied the gyre for more than 30 years hoping to tease apart the complex physical, chemical, and biological interactions that allow it to support the vast array of creatures that live there. But the ecosystem is also important for another reason: it’s starting to show evidence of human-caused climate change. The ocean current is “a canary in a coal mine in a lot of ways,” says White, a microbial oceanographer at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. “We’re starting to see changes in the ecosystem, which means we’ve affected one of the most remote and isolated ecosystems on the planet.”
Crewmembers prepare for a week at sea studying the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.
COURTESY OF ANGELICQUE WHITE
To study the gyre, researchers have sailed nearly every month since 1988 to Station ALOHA, a spot within the ocean current that is used as an open-water research base. Maintenance work on the ship that takes scientists there put a stop to several of the monthly cruises starting in early 2020. Then, coronavirus hit, and the team wasn’t sure when they’d be able to go back out to sea. Finally, in late spring, the researchers got word from the National Science Foundation and the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, which coordinates oceanographic ships’ schedules, that they could start planning summer cruises, provided that crew members undergo stringent pre-cruise quarantine and testing. By midsummer, the crew was Station ALOHA bound, following strict social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing requirements. “It felt sooo good to science again,” White tweeted on July 21.
But White’s experience is the exception, not the rule. Many researchers are stuck at home, analyzing data they’ve already collected or planning data collection for when they can travel out into the field again. “I know there’s so many of my colleagues that are desperate to go to their field sites,” White says. 
Travel bans delay an international project
One researcher unable to travel to her field site is Barbara Piperata, an anthropologist at Ohio State University (OSU). Earlier this year, she was set to begin a three-year project tracking how cultural practices and exposure to infectious pathogens in drinking water shapes the gut microbiome of children in Belém, Brazil, in their first two years of life. Her team, which includes collaborators and students based in Brazil, planned to gather data on infants in poor and wealthy neighborhoods and look at how daily routines in those environments affected the bacterial composition of the children’s guts.
“It is an enormously hands-on international project,” Piperata says, and “it’s been enormously affected by COVID.”
The project was slated to launch in January, so in the early weeks of 2020, her team began arranging logistics, including finding Brazilian students to serve on the field team, finalizing and validating the tools for the study, and strengthening contacts with local health clinics and hospitals where recruitment would take place. Then COVID-19 began spreading beyond Asia, and by February “it became apparent that things might change,” she explains. By March, “everything really went haywire.” 
Because of the pandemic, OSU would not allow Piperata to take a planned spring break trip to Brazil in March to conduct the initial stage of training for data collection. “Probably a good idea,” Piperata says. The university did not specify when research trips could resume, so her team tried to prepare for a best-case scenario—travel in the summer—and a worst-case scenario of no travel until later in the year or even next year. By May, Piperata knew she wouldn’t be headed to Brazil any time soon, so she and her colleagues and two students involved in the project began filming instructions for her Brazilian collaborators in English and Portuguese on the various protocols, including how to interview and survey the mothers and how to collect fecal samples from babies, mothers, and children in participating households, along with breast milk samples from mothers and saliva samples from babies. The team also plans to measure mothers’ and babies’ height and weight, and the babies’ head circumference, and to collect drinking water samples and surface swabs of the participants’ houses to assess which pathogens the children are exposed to.

The pandemic has “slowed down the work by about nine months,” Piperata says. And while her in-country collaborators will be able to collect the data, they have been delayed as the city of Belem has been on lockdown. As the city is now loosening restrictions, the team expects to begin participant recruitment in the upcoming months.
However, until case numbers decline considerably in the area, the team will need to recruit at a slower pace and take precautions to avoid exposing themselves and study participants to SARS-CoV-2. “We certainly don’t want to do that,” Piperata says. Delaying data collection until next year isn’t an option, as the study will track the babies from birth to age two and the project must be completed within the National Science Foundation’s three-year funding window. The team has decided that if the case numbers remain high, the researchers will alter the study design to reduce the data collection timeline. 
Piperata also notes that there are some types of data she can’t rely on others to collect for her—data that will be lost if she can’t travel to Brazil. Ethnography, the study of customs of individual peoples and cultures, is central to this research, and “we learn by seeing,” she says. Ordinarily, while others would collect samples and measurements, Piperata would be watching the mother and child and asking specific questions about their behaviors and interactions, often off the cuff, to learn more about each families’ culture, values, and child-rearing practices. “Nobody can collect those kinds of data for you right now,” she says. Even to teach other team members to gather this kind of information, she says, she’d need to be there, showing her fellow researchers what she sees and how it informs her line of questioning. “I have 20 years of experience doing field research,” she says, “and I imagined this project, so I have bigger ideas in my head about things I want to understand.”
Catch-22: Research on infectious disease outbreaks stalls during the pandemic
San Francisco State University’s Ravinder Sehgal, who studies infectious diseases in birds, also has to contend with the prospect that his team has lost data forever. His field project focused on how deforestation in the Central African country of Cameroon affects the species diversity of mosquitos, which can carry malaria and dengue. He monitors how changes in mosquito populations can spread such diseases to birds and also to local human populations. “What we’re finding is . . . that when you cut down the rainforests, you get these human-biting mosquitoes that can appear very quickly,” he tells The Scientist. As the mosquitos move in after deforestation, he says, they can cause increased prevalence of mosquito-borne human diseases, and also appear to infect birds with diseases the animals haven’t encountered before. 
To track such changes, Sehgal and his colleagues analyze blood samples from birds and collect data on mosquito abundance and diversity at a rainforest site before it’s cleared. They then take similar measurements after the forest is razed, and again when a palm oil plantation has been planted at the site. The results, Sehgal says, have revealed how deforestation affects disease transmission and offered a clue about which diseases emerge from a deforested site—information that could be relevant to understanding how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, jumped from animals to people. 
Sehgal says his field research was already on hold before the pandemic started because of a conflict in the region, but he and his collaborators had hoped that peace talks would lead to an end to the fighting so they could return this summer. There’ve been recent efforts to resolve the conflict, but because of COVID-19, San Francisco State University has banned faculty and staff from making work-related international trips until next year. “We [can’t] do any work this summer at all,” he says. “We had all the data from before the deforestation now. We only had a limited amount of data from after the deforestation. We wanted to go back and get much more data from the ‘after’ scenario.”
Funding for the work, which came from the United States Agency for International Development, has ended, and because of the ongoing conflict in southwest Cameroon and because he and his colleagues weren’t able to collect all the data they’d planned to, it is not likely to be funded again, Sehgal says. “It’s understandable obviously. We don’t want to be spreading the coronavirus around, but it’s also kind of a catch-22 because now we’re not doing research on the very problem that caused us to get here.”
Correction (August 20, 2020): This article originally stated that the Station ALOHA crew got word from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that they could set out. The National Science Foundation, not NOAA, coordinates oceanographic ships’ schedules. The Scientist regrets the error.
Immune Biomarkers Tied to Severe COVID-19: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BUSRACAVUS
A
study of COVID-19 patients at two London hospitals has identified blood-based immunological changes that are linked to the disease and, in some cases, to symptom severity. The results, reported in Nature Medicine on Monday (August 17) join a growing body of data on how the human immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 that will hopefully lead to prognostic tools and potential treatments.
“The study is a nice comprehensive characterization of the different trajectories of host response against SARS-CoV-2 [and] technically well performed,” Antonio Bertoletti an emerging infectious disease researcher at Duke-National University of Singapore who was not involved in the research, writes in an email to The Scientist. It provides “some specific findings, like the severe drop of dendritic cells and the inflammatory cytokine profile,” he adds, “[that] might predict the worsening of the disease.”
Microbiologist and immunologist Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa who also was not a part of the research team is less optimistic about the potential for prediction. “They came up with parameters that seem to define the different [severity] groups,” he says, “but for an individual [patient] it’s very hard” to make a prediction because “there is so much overlap” between the groups.  
He nonetheless praises the efforts of the authors of the paper and similar endeavors, saying such studies provide “a sense for what seems to be happening in people who do worse, which in itself is useful, if not for prognosis . . . it can help you in management [of the disease].”
There have been a number of recent papers describing immune signatures of COVID-19, including ones in Science, Science Immunology, Nature and Immunity. Read The Scientist’s coverage of the Immunity paper here.
Since late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been relentlessly and rampantly spreading from person to person across the globe. While in many people the virus causes no ill effects, in others it ravages the lungs, leaving them hospitalized for weeks, and in some the infection is fatal. More than 780,000 people have died from the disease worldwide to date.
For a disease with such diversity of symptoms and outcomes, and in patients of different ages and sexes with different underlying conditions, finding a common immune signature for COVID-19—a set of immune proteins and cells that define the disease—may seem like an impossibility, but immunologist Adrian Hayday of King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute was not discouraged by the odds.
Despite “extraordinary heterogeneity” within patient populations, he says, “immune responses against potentially lethal pathogens can have very dominant effects that rise above the background and therefore provide you with an immune signature.”
Discovering such a signature would be of great value, he explains. For one thing, “you might find things that are unique to COVID-19 and that might give you some very important things to target therapeutically,” he says. And, it might identify “changes that actually could give the doctors a very early indication of which way a patient was going to go.”
For Hayday and his colleagues’ study, the team collected blood samples from 63 patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Guys and St. Thomas’s hospitals in London from March to May this year, and from 55 control individuals, including healthy people who had previously tested positive for coronavirus (and had had no or mild symptoms), people with other respiratory tract infections, and healthy individuals with no recent respiratory infections.
The researchers performed flow cytometry experiments and protein assays on the blood samples to analyze the presence and characteristics of various immune cell types and to measure antibodies and other immune factors.
IP-10 levels in a patient’s first blood sample could even predict the length of hospital stay
Among the results, the team found that almost all COVID-19 patients had robust production of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies—which raises questions about the general usefulness of convalescent plasma treatment, which supplies antibodies from recovered donors, says clinician scientist Manu Shankar-Hari of King’s College London who coauthored the study. Indeed, the FDA’s plan to approve the treatment is now on hold due to lack of evidence of efficacy. A report in Immunity, however, suggests antibody quality, not quantity, is linked to outcome and therefore that plasma from survivors might be qualitatively better than that of very sick patients. There were also three patients in Haday and Shankar-Hari’s study in whom no antibodies were detected and all three died, suggesting select individuals may benefit.
As a whole, patient samples were also enriched for plasmablasts (antibody secreting cells), markers of T cell exhaustion, and the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10, while lacking in basophils and certain subpopulations of dendritic cells and monocytes compared with healthy controls.
Some of these immune features were also seen in patients with other respiratory tract infections. Others, such as low basophils and dendritic cells and high IP-10, were particular to COVID-19.
Some features correlated with the severity of disease. Through a longitudinal study of individual patients—taking blood samples on different days during the hospital stay—the team showed that those patients who had high levels of IL-6, IL-10, and especially IP-10 when their first blood sample was taken were more likely to have a poorer outcome than patients in whom these cytokine levels were lower.
The trio of cytokines was “quite an extraordinary predictor that could discern whether a patient at admission with respiratory difficulties would actually improve or worsen,” says Hayday. IP-10 levels in a patient’s first blood sample could even predict the length of hospital stay, he adds.
“It’s a great paper,” says Michael Betts of the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work, and “it certainly agrees with a lot of the literature that has accumulated already.” He notes that while some differences exist between the new results and other COVID-19 signature studies, for the most part they are similar.
Hayday’s group has made the raw data available here.
It remains to be seen—in longitudinal validation studies with a larger cohort of patients—whether the trio of cytokines will be reliable predictors of severity, says Shankar-Hari, and whether they might be worthy targets for therapy.
For now, “we still know little about why different infected individuals [have] such diversity of symptoms and outcomes,” writes Bertoletti, “but at least we start to understand what is occurring in such different manifestations and this is important to clinical management.”

Combating COVID-19 with Cell-Free Expression/-/Imagine the ability to rewire, reshape, and use parts of a living system to build something new. It is not science fiction, nor is it Frankenstein’s monster. It is synthetic biology, a relatively nascent field that is making a profound impact on society and healthcare. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are turning to synthetic biology, and in particular, to cell-free expression systems to develop new rapid diagnostic tools, vaccines, and treatments.
“It’s a way to program information. We all do that every day in our cell phones; we program information in zeros and ones. Synthetic biology takes that to a totally new dimension. Rather than just being able to control information, I now get to control information that builds atoms,” said Michael Jewett, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern University.
Synthetic biologists such as Jewett combine engineering principles, computer programming, and molecular biology to design and build synthetic gene circuits and other molecular components that rewire living cells for a variety of new applications, including biological sensors and diagnostic tests. 
Going Cell-Free
Rewiring a living system is tricky. Cells are already biologically programmed to achieve their own functional goals, not the goals of the researcher. To circumvent this problem, synthetic biologists remove the cell wall and extract the cell’s molecular machinery, including the core factors needed for transcription and translation. This cell-free expression system can then be coerced to produce and even detect proteins of interest. 
“It's like if you took a car, you lift up the hood, pull out the engine, and you repurpose it for something else. We're repurposing the molecular machinery to do some objective function,” said Jewett. Working outside a cellular system prevents the cell from responding and changing its gene expression profile, ensuring a reproducible and stable molecular expression system.  
“The complexities itself are much lower than that of the living cells, and it's easier to control the different features in that you can dictate, at least at the outset, what [compounds] are there and how much is there,” said James Collins a professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Scientists have used cell-free expression systems for two decades as a basic research tool to make discoveries about the living world. In fact, scientists used cell-free systems to uncover the genetic code in the 1960s. However, many of these early systems were small-scale, did not last very long, and could not make complex proteins. Within the last 20 years, researchers have addressed each of these problems, transforming cell-free expression systems from a basic tool into a useable technology platform.
“The systems now, instead of lasting five minutes, last 15 to 20 hours in batch reactions. They can make really complex proteins all the way up to full-length antibodies, which are used in medicine. They can carry out pretty complex integrated circuitry that can basically detect, sense, and respond to something just like a cell,” said Jewett. 
Researchers also developed better ways to support cell-free expression systems by supplying the system with glucose as a source of energy and other biological compounds such as amino acids needed to produce proteins. Scientists even solved the problem of scalability. “If you imagine running a PCR reaction, which is typically two or five microliters, in a 1000-liter scale, that's what we're doing economically, which is crazy. In fact, many people kind of deemed that impossible 10 years ago, but it's happening,” said Jewett. 
Cell-free expression systems can be rapidly pre-assembled and stored in a laboratory freezer, or freeze-dried in a powdered form. This eliminates the need for researchers to regrow cells. “The problems then reduce to automated liquid handling,” said Jewett. Automated liquid handling robots enable researchers to run more samples at a time for rapid library screening or analyzing genetic parts and gene circuits. 
Making cell-free expression systems is an art that, much like any other laboratory technique, takes skill, practice, and time. Some researchers make their own cell-free expression systems, but others purchase commercial ready-to-use master mixes. These mixes, such as the myTXTL® Cell-Free Expression System from Arbor Biosciences, come pre-loaded with all the molecular components for a given reaction so that the researcher only has to add their DNA sample for reliable and robust high-yield protein expression.
“The homebrew has some really nice efforts by Michael Jewett and his team to get them highly functional, but when we make our own, we're not as good and so it often doesn’t have the functionality level that we need,” said Collins. “My team has used Arbor Biosciences; they have very good products. In the cell-free world, they're one of the go-to [companies].” Like homebrewed systems, purchased premixed cell-free systems can also be paired with automated liquid handling for high-throughput and efficient library screening or analysis. 
Pivoting
These advances made it possible for synthetic biologists to develop practical technologies that mitigate disease and impact society. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, synthetic biologists pivoted the cell-free expression technology that they were using for other diseases to develop new diagnostics, materials, and treatments specifically for COVID-19. 
Keith Pardee, a synthetic biologist at the University of Toronto was working on a three-year project to send Zika virus diagnostic testing kits to low- and middle-income countries. “When the COVID-19 outbreak happened, we thought this is obviously a natural thing for us to do. So, we basically are taking that platform for Zika and applying it to SARS-CoV-2,” said Pardee.
Pardee extracts enzymes needed for transcription and translation from Escherichia coli to create a cell-free expression system that senses parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and triggers a molecular switch to produce a reporter protein. It also eliminates the need to purify RNA from the sample and can replace RT-PCR for more rapid diagnostic testing. “Because we didn’t have that black box of working with a cell, we were able to get sensors very quickly, maybe within two days of having the synthetic DNA arrive in the lab, we had sensors working,” said Pardee. 
Pardee will send COVID-19 diagnostic kits in two waves to the same countries that he was planning to send the Zika kits, only now he has added Toronto, Canada to the list. The first wave will supply 1000 test kits a day for two weeks. The second wave will contain a “lab-in-a-box,” that could convert a common microbiology lab into a diagnostic testing lab to maintain a sustained testing capacity.
Similarly, James Collins was developing a suite of clothing-based sensors for healthcare workers, first responders, and military personnel to detect the presence of viruses or compounds. “The idea would be like a lab coat of the future,” said Collins. He conceived the idea during the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Collins and his team freeze-dried cell-free expression systems and locked them onto a piece of paper, and later into fabric. They then showed that the system could be rehydrated and transcription and translation activated by adding liquid.
“We were revising this publication when the pandemic hit, and realized that we could embody the same technology into facemasks by having an insert that can be added. If a person is infected, they'll give out particles in water vapor—that is coughing, sneezing, talking—and that itself could activate these freeze-dried components,” said Collins. If a person were infected, the mask would produce a fluorescent signal that could be detected using a handheld fluorometer. 
Collins’s previous discoveries in synthetic biology also contributed to the technology behind the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, which is in the late-stages of development. Ten years ago, with George Daly and Derek Rossi, Collins developed a stable synthetic mRNA system to express proteins directly in cells. They used the technology to efficiently reprogram induced pluripotent stem cells, but mentioned in the paper that the technology could be used for RNA-based vaccine development. 
“I've been so motivated by so many scientists, by how much we're all redirecting; we're pivoting,” said Jewett. Four months ago, Jewett’s research focused primarily on developing water-based diagnostics for identifying toxins. Using the same cell-free expression approaches, Jewett is now developing CRISPR-based diagnostics for rapid COVID-19 detection and working on antiviral frontline approaches to stop COVID-19 infection. 
Using cell-free expression systems, Jewett’s team identifies proteins that could cloak the COVID-19 spike protein and prevent its connection to cell receptors. Identifying good clones using classic mammalian cell-culture can take 12 -18 months. “We need two months. We need four weeks. We need to have technologies that can meet the pace of this pandemic,” said Jewett. Instead of growing cells, Jewett and his team thaw pre-built, frozen cell-free expression stocks, add DNA, and identify good candidates within a day. 
If other laboratories are interested in pivoting but are unable to pre-assemble frozen stocks or lack the technical experience needed, they can reach out to commercial providers, such as Arbor Biosciences for reliable cell-free expression systems. Arbor Biosciences is adept at developing robust cell-free systems that can be immediately implemented in COVID-19 research or in other disease-based research for rapid, efficient, and dependable discovery. 
“In this era of emergent and reemerging pandemic outbreaks, what we need is speed. Cell-free systems really offer this exciting component, and the technology is well suited to address that need,” said Jewett. Cell-free expression systems alone will not solve the COVID-19 pandemic, but it can complement existing technologies. “Research is just developing. We, like many others, have been conceiving ideas and schemes and now's the time,” said Jewett. “We have to make an impact with whatever we can.”

Connecting the DOTS/-/A
few months before SARS sparked major outbreaks in several countries in early 2003, there were a series of small clusters of infection in Guangdong province, in southern China. Between November 2002 and January 2003, seven clusters were reported in Guangdong, ranging from one to nine cases in size. Based on the scope of these outbreaks, researchers later estimated that the reproduction number—R, which is defined as the average number of new infectious caused by a typical case—may have been around 0.8 during this period. However, by the time the first major outbreak occurred in Hong Kong a couple of months later, SARS had an R of more than 2.
BASIC BOOKS, JULY 2020
There are several reasons the R of an infection may increase, and we can understand them better by breaking transmission down into four main components. Consider the steps that lead an infectious person to spread the infection to others. It depends on A) the duration of time someone is infectious, B) the opportunities for transmission during this period (such as social interactions), C) the transmission probability during each opportunity (such as whether someone coughs or sneezes), and D) the probability that the person on the other end of the interaction is susceptible to that infection. I like to call these four things the DOTS for short, and if we multiply them together we get the value of the reproduction number: 
R = duration x opportunities x transmission probability x susceptibility
For example, if a case is infectious for a week on average (i.e. duration), interacts with around five new people per day (i.e. opportunities), has a 5 percent chance of infecting each of these contacts during an interaction (i.e. transmission probability), and everyone is susceptible, we’d expect 7 x 5 x 0.05 x 1 = 1.75 secondary cases on average.
As I explain in my latest book, The Rules of Contagion, for infectious diseases, each of the DOTS can influence the extent of contagion. One 2016 study estimated that viruses that transmitted successfully among humans tended to cause longer infections (that is, larger duration value) and spread directly from one person to another, rather than via a secondary source (that is, more opportunities). Transmission probability can also make a difference; avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, have struggled to gain a foothold in people because they can’t latch onto the cells in our airway as easily as human viruses can. That’s why there was concern in 2011, when teams at Erasmus Medical Center and the University of Wisconsin–Madison announced that they had each created new strains of H5N1. Among other changes, mutations in these viruses could make them more capable of infecting the easy-to-access upper portion of the mammalian airway. Unlike circulating avian influenza viruses—which had only spread between humans who’d come into close contact with each other—these mutant versions could go airborne, successfully spreading between ferrets in the lab. An increase in susceptibility can also nudge the reproduction number higher, such as when vaccination coverage falls for diseases such as measles, which means outbreaks may follow.
As well as understanding how infections spread, the DOTS can provide insights into how we might control them. In the case of HIV, for example, treatment can reduce the duration of time someone is infectious, and fewer sexual partners can reduce the number of opportunities for transmission. The latter generally isn’t an appealing option for most people, so health agencies have instead encouraged people to use condoms, which reduces the transmission probability during sexual encounters. In recent years, there have also been successful programs of pre-exposure prophylaxis, whereby HIV-negative individuals take anti-HIV drugs to reduce their susceptibility to infection.
For SARS-CoV-2, there isn’t yet a way to reduce susceptibility other than through natural infection. Even with infection, the duration of subsequent immunity remains unclear. This means control measures have focused on decreasing the effective duration of infectiousness (by isolating people with symptoms and quarantining their contacts), the number of opportunities (by reducing social interactions), or limiting the probability of transmission with personal protective equipment. Just as there’s not a single component of transmission that made the COVID-19 pandemic take off, there won’t be a simple solitary measure that will keep SARS-CoV-2 under control in the long term. To prevent large future outbreaks, countries will have to connect together measures that can target several of the DOTS.

Differences in Antibody Responses Linked to COVID-19 Outcomes/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SHIVENDU JUAHARI
N
early half a year into the coronavirus pandemic, hospital clinicians still have no good way of knowing how and why some of their COVID-19 patients recover from infection, whereas others take a turn for the worse and die.
A recent study of 22 hospitalized COVID-19 patients provides some clues. Through an extensive computational analysis of the patients’ antibody features and functions, researchers report marked differences between those who survived and those who died. Notably, antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein were stronger among COVID-19 survivors, whereas antibody responses targeting the virus’s nucleocapsid protein were elevated in patients who died. The findings were published last month (July 30) in Immunity.
While it’s not clear if these different antibody responses are the reason for the patients’ different disease trajectories, the research “provides mechanistic insights into the nature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2,” notes Stanford University immunologist Bali Pulendran, who wasn’t involved in the study. In addition, “you could [potentially] have a means of monitoring these COVID patients to identify these signatures, and thereby get a sense of what the prognosis could be.”
In late February, as COVID-19 tore through nursing homes in Seattle, some patients were seen by University of Washington physician and immunologist Helen Chu at Harborview Medical Center. Chu puzzled why certain COVID-19 patients, who seemed fine at first, would rapidly deteriorate from one day to the next and die, recalls her collaborator Galit Alter of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard.
The survivors really picked different functions than the deceased. They just leveraged their antibodies in a different way.
—Galit Alter, Ragon Institute
In search of answers, Chu and her colleagues collected blood samples from 22 patients upon hospital admission and sent them to Alter, whose group specializes in a branch of immunology called “systems serology.” This combines experimental techniques to analyze the features and functions of antibodies with computational approaches to discern, for instance, which ones correlate with immunity. From previous studies of viral infections including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, Alter has learned that it’s not the quantity of antibodies that’s predictive of immunity, but rather, their different functions and qualities, and, importantly, how they act collectively as a “swarm,” she explains.
Alter and her colleagues profiled the antibodies of the 22 patients; 12 had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 had died. The scientists focused on SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies that target the virus’s key proteins, including the spike protein, which it uses to enter human cells, and the nucleocapsid protein, which encloses its genetic material. For each viral target, the researchers documented a range of antibody characteristics, such as the quantity of specific antibody types and their ability to stimulate other immune cells such as microbe-devouring neutrophils.
The team detected no difference in the overall amount of antibodies between survivors and those who died, nor in the antibodies’ overall capacity to neutralize the virus in vitro. However, when the team used computational methods to analyze the functional differences between the two groups, they found a combination of five antibody features distinguished them from one another. Overall, survivors had a much stronger antibody response to the spike protein, whereas antibody responses in those who died were more focused on the nucleocapsid protein.
It’s not that survivors have more spike-targeting antibodies, Alter notes, rather, their antibodies are “targeting [the spike] more than they’re targeting [the nucleocapsid].” In fact, in the Seattle cohort, these five features proved even more predictive of a patient’s recovery or death than factors such as age or sex.
The team also validated this approach in a larger cohort of COVID-19 patients from a Boston hospital, 20 of whom had recovered and 20 of whom had died. There too, survivors’ antibodies were “laser-focused” on targeting the spike protein, whereas antibodies tended to focus on the nucleocapsid protein among those who died, Alter says. “The survivors really picked different functions than the deceased. They just leveraged their antibodies in a different way.”
An outstanding question is whether the nature of a patient’s antibody response is actually what determines whether they recover or die, or if it’s simply a symptom of the overall function of the immune response, Alter says.
That said, the data do provide plausible hypotheses on how antibodies could contribute to the body’s defeat of SARS-CoV-2, she adds. Spike-focused antibodies might be better at helping the body clear the virus, which could help other components of the immune system drive down inflammation associated with COVID-19. The antibodies’ focus on the nucleocapsid in other patients could have to do with the fact that some people have greater viral loads in the lung, causing the immune system to encounter large quantities of the nucleocapsid protein—which is generally much more abundant than the spike protein. This could cause antibodies to become “distracted” from the right target—the spike protein—and tailor their response towards the nucleocapsid protein.
While preliminary, the findings could offer a path forward in developing a prognostic tool for clinicians to discern relatively early on in the course of disease which patients are likely to fare worse and therefore need more careful attention or should be prioritized for certain types of therapies, Alter suggests. Other investigators are looking into cytokines as disease severity markers, but the trouble is that those aren’t specific to SARS-CoV-2 infections.
See “Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Could Auger Severe COVID-19”
The findings could be useful for vaccine scientists, notes Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved in the research. “You need some detailed info on the correlates of protection—otherwise how can you ever know if your vaccine elicits them,” he writes to The Scientist in an email. “Up to now a lot of [COVID-19] findings have been a little general. With studies like this, we get into some real granularity of what a protective response looks like.” Notably, most vaccinologists are focusing on the spike protein, which is probably a good thing, Alter adds.
The authors acknowledge several limitations of the research, including the small size of the Seattle cohort. However, Alter’s group was able to validate the correlations they uncovered in a larger cohort of 170 patients, whose antibody responses were tracked over time, in a soon-to-be published study.
Collectively, the findings are adding to a growing body of research on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the human immune response, Pulendran says. Just last week in Science, he and his colleagues investigated the source of higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in severely affected COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, the blood-borne monocytes and dendritic cells that usually secrete these cytokines were too “functionally sluggish” to respond to viral protein, Pulendran says. Rather, the cytokines appeared to be emanating from the lung, he explains.
How this dysfunctional innate immune response relates to emerging peculiarities of the adaptive immune response—such as T cell and antibody immunity—is still a mystery. “The field of COVID immunology is at a stage where there are many exciting observations and insights about one aspect of the immune system or another aspect,” Pulendran says. “The challenge over the coming weeks and months will be [to figure out] how to fit these all together.”

COVID-19 Outbreaks Occur as Students Return to Campus/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DOBRILA VIGNJEVIC

s college campuses across the US welcome students back for the start of the semester, numerous universities are faced with isolating individuals who are testing positive for COVID-19, Inside Higher Ed reports. For the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the spread of multiple clusters of COVID-19 cases has caused the school to transition to online-only classes for the duration of the semester, effective Wednesday, August 19.
After the first week of in-person classes, UNC announced four COVID-19 outbreaks, resulting in the quarantine of three residence halls and one off-campus fraternity house, totaling 130 students and five staff members since August 10. The Daily Tar Heel, UNC’s student newspaper, tweeted Monday afternoon that in the wake of these cases, the university is suspending in-person instruction. 
Some of the earliest COVID-19 outbreaks on college campuses involved football players who returned to school up to two months before their peers for summer workouts, The New York Times reported earlier this summer. 
In the wake of so many schools experiencing outbreaks, many sports that are high- or moderate-risk for COVID-19 transmission, such as football and soccer, have been postponed until the spring. Additionally, some schools, including the University of Maryland, have announced limitations on the number of students who can live in their residence halls. Other universities had anticipated such problems and scrapped in-person instruction from the get-go.
Here are some of the outbreaks that have occurred at college campuses both over the summer and as students have returned for the fall semester:

The Push to Deploy At-Home Antigen Tests for COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SHIVENDU JUAHARI
T
esting backlogs, reagent shortages, and limited access have contributed to inadequate testing for COVID-19 in the US and elsewhere. But in recent months, new types of assay that promise to offer quicker, cheaper, and more user-friendly features have begun to roll out. Saliva tests, for one, are gaining traction as screening tools for universities and professional basketball teams. Antigen testing is another approach that, if given regulators’ blessings, might give consumers the ability to take their own tests at home and get results on the spot. 
Several diagnostics firms are currently working to gain regulatory approval and bring products like this to market in huge numbers.  
“This is like a wartime effort, there are many fronts that we’re trying to fight this disease,” says Stephen Tang, president and CEO of OraSure, which is working on a test that members of the public could take themselves. The firm plans to manufacture millions of antigen tests annually. 
Results from such tests can be available in less than an hour and the fact that people could take them themselves has convinced some that antigen tests could be a game-changer in fighting the pandemic.
“These simple tools can bring a sense of normalcy and security back to society,” rapid test advocate and Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina tweeted August 12. 
There is also potential for high-throughput antigen tests to be used in lab settings as well, to speed up mass testing across whole countries or regions. 
In essence, antigen tests are the reverse of antibody tests. In the latter, viral proteins, the antigens, are distributed across a plate within the test device. If an individual’s blood sample contains antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, those antibodies will bind to the antigens, triggering an emission of light or color change, indicating a positive result. 
Antigen tests, in contrast, contain antibodies on the plate instead. These are just like those generated naturally by people and animals to fight off a COVID-19 infection. When a sample, usually a nasal swab, containing virus particles is applied to the assay, the antibodies bind to the viral antigens and similarly trigger a visible result to show that someone is presently infected.
Compared to PCR and antibody tests, antigen tests take a bit longer to develop because manufacturers have to be sure that they have identified the ideal antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 and not to proteins from other viruses or microbes. Then the production of those antibodies using animal models is scaled up.
At least two firms, Quidel and BD, have already obtained Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for antigen tests designed to be administered by healthcare workers. 
Quidel reports that the sensitivity of its test—the extent to which true positives are detected—is 96.7 percent. In BD’s case, the reported sensitivity is 84 percent. Both firms claim their tests have a specificity of 100 percent, meaning the tests should produce no false positives. But earlier this month, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine tested positive on a Quidel antigen test only for three subsequent PCR tests to show he was in fact negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
“We take the issue regarding Governor DeWine very seriously and we are investigating the matter through our Quality Management System, trying to learn the specifics of the issue in order to get to the root cause. At this time, there is nothing to suggest that there is a problem with the Sofia® 2 instrument or the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA rapid test,” a spokeswoman for Quidel wrote in an email to The Scientist. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) does not currently recommend antigen tests for clinical diagnosis because there is not enough data to support their accuracy. In fact, based on the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests for other respiratory infections such as influenza, the WHO says the sensitivity of antigen tests for COVID-19 could lie between 34 percent and 80 percent, far below the performance of traditional PCR-based diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This has not stopped India, to name one country, using antigen tests en masse. Health providers there have used antigen tests for months now to screen many thousands of people. And in July, authorities approved a new rapid antigen test developed by Indian firm MyLab Discovery Solutions. It is already on sale and costs roughly $6 per test. 
Only a few North American companies developing at-home rapid antigen tests have released validation results so far but Sona Nanotech is one of them. CEO Darren Rowles says that in evaluations using about 30 different viruses, bacteria, and fungi, the antibodies selected by Sona Nanotech only formed a successful bond with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the original SARS virus that emerged in 2002. 
Antigen test developers can decide to target a particular type of protein on the virus. “In our instance, it’s specific to the spike proteins on the surface,” says Rowles. Quidel’s and BD’s antigen tests, in contrast, target the nucleocapsid (N) protein. 
In lab experiments using 30 swab samples from healthy individuals, the Sona Nanotech test correctly identified 29 of the samples as negative. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was then artificially added to these 29 samples and the test subsequently identified 28 as positive. The company has not yet reported the results of studies in the field using a mix of positive and negative samples from participants. Once they are published, Rowles says, the firm hopes to apply for EUA from Health Canada and the FDA. 
“The idea is for healthcare workers to be taking it first and then some modifications to the test platform to allow at-home use,” he explains.
Various other firms are vying with Sona Nanotech to become the next to achieve EUA for their tests, including E25Bio, Iceni Diagnostics and OraSure.
OraSure’s at-home test will require the user to perform a quick nasal swab and then apply a solution to the swab, which itself will function very much like a pregnancy test, says Tang.
“You can read the test in under an hour,” he explains. “It reads as a control line and a test line so if there are two lines present, you are coronavirus positive and should seek to self-isolate yourself.”
OraSure has not published any validation data for its tests yet but the firm has committed to manufacturing them in large volumes if EUA is granted. The company recently announced that it would be hiring an additional 177 staff to help increase capacity. 
“We’re going to devote a considerable amount of that capacity to COVID-19,” says Tang. 
There are real benefits to increasing the availability of tests for COVID-19, says biomedical scientist David Grenache, the chief scientific officer at TriCore Reference Laboratories. 
“By deploying more antigen tests that can be done rapidly, we will increase the likelihood that we’ll detect infected individuals,” says Grenache, who is not involved in the development of antigen tests himself.
However, there are stumbling blocks to consider. “There’s always concern about patients doing their own tests because they’re not trained in laboratory techniques,” says Grenache. Inadequate swabbing could mean an inaccurate result. 
And then there are politics. Because mask-wearing has become a politicized issue in the United States, he notes, the uptake of at-home antigen tests might not be spread evenly across all parts of society.
Antigen tests may also struggle to correctly identify people as positive if they have lower levels of the virus in their system, such as during the latter stages of an infection when the worst of the illness is over. 
That’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, says Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. “Very low levels of virus aren’t a problem because you’re probably not infectious,” she says. 
Riley points out that rapid antigen tests for malaria are widely used. These are often self-administered by travelers, for example. “The precedent is there and those cost a dollar a pop or less,” she adds.
We’re still months away at the very least from having millions of at-home rapid antigen tests available for people to use. In order for that to happen, governments would likely have to plough billions of dollars into the manufacturing of such tests. But the other place that antigen tests could make a difference is in professional labs, which are currently processing huge numbers of PCR tests every day around the world.
Lab-based analysis of antigen tests is more sensitive than the rapid tests used at home or at the point of care, Grenache says, because the light-detecting machines in a lab used to identify the reaction associated with antibody-antigen binding are much more accurate than the systems built in to self-testing kits. And, in principle, lab-based antigen tests could be quicker to do than the PCR assays we’ve relied on so far. 
“Those tests will be much easier to scale up,” says Grenache. “Once those are available, assuming the performance is good, that’s the type of test we would offer in my lab.”
FDA Approves New Saliva-Based COVID-19 Test/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ONCEAWITKIN

he US Food and Drug Administration has given Emergency Use Authorization to a fifth saliva-based test for COVID-19. The low-cost and noninvasive procedure developed by the Yale School of Public Health requires minimal processing and retains much of the accuracy of traditional nasopharyngeal swabs. 
The United States has struggled to implement consistent and widespread testing throughout the pandemic, making it difficult for public health officials to track the spread of the virus. In addition, the equipment and reagents needed to carry out PCR tests have frequently run low, from the swabs needed to collect the sample to the reagents that extract viral RNA.
In a recent paper, published August 4 on the preprint server medRxiv, a team led by Yale postdoc Chantal Vogels detailed the new tool called SalivaDirect. A team composed of many of the same researchers had previously shown that saliva could be collected in any sterile container and that the saliva remained largely stable even when warm, negating the need for special tubes or preservatives. 
“This is a huge step forward to make testing more accessible,” Vogels said in a recent press release. “This started off as an idea in our lab soon after we found saliva to be a promising sample type of the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and now it has the potential to be used on a large scale to help protect public health.” 
See “Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19”
Traditional COVID-19 testing is a two-part process: once the sample is collected, the virus’s RNA must be extracted before it can be detected by sensitive, PCR-based methods. SalivaDirect removes the extraction step, replacing it “with something that’s really simple. You add an enzyme, you heat it up, so you lose the most expensive step and the most time consuming and the most skilled [steps],” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at Yale and a coauthor on the study, tells NPR.
The new test, which still relies on PCR to convert viral RNA to DNA and then amplify sequences, can run approximately 90 samples in fewer than three hours, STAT reports, with the potential to scale much higher in larger labs with automation. While most tests, spit or otherwise, are analyzed using PCR-based methods, there are other promising alternatives, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), that have also received Emergency Use Authorization for testing using nasopharyngeal swabs. 
Yale is offering SalivaDirect’s protocol open source, meaning researchers worldwide can take and adapt the method for use in their own labs depending on what resources they have available. The authors say they engineered their protocol to be as adaptive as possible to different PCR kits already on the market.
“Providing this type of flexibility for processing saliva samples to test for COVID-19 infection is groundbreaking in terms of efficiency and avoiding shortages of crucial test components like reagents,” Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn says in a press release announcing the emergency use authorization.
This same flexibility and relatively streamlined protocol also make SalivaDirect a cheaper alternative to traditional PCR tests, the authors say. The total cost of the reagents needed for one test is roughly $5, meaning it could be offered to the public for much less, perhaps as little as $10. 
“This could be one the first major game changers in fighting the pandemic,” Andy Slavitt, a former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, tweeted in response to the news. “Rarely am I this enthusiastic . . . [With] a $10 test, you can test every day or every couple days.”
When compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, the authors found a “high agreement” of greater than 94 percent in detecting true positives between the two methods. In his Twitter thread, Slavitt gave a more conservative estimate of 88 percent to 94 percent accuracy when comparing SalivaDirect against both swabs and other saliva tests. 
Martin Burke, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who developed a similar saliva test, tells NPR that even a test with only 88 percent sensitivity can be extremely useful if it is plentiful enough for the kind of mass, repeated testing being carried out at his university. “If you do that twice a week, you’re going to catch 99% of the people—98% of the people,” Burke says.
SalivaDirect has already been used voluntarily by several teams of professional basketball players. Coaches, staff, and players from both the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association began voluntarily using the test in June, and their participation was central in gaining FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Yale is now partnering with the sports agencies to study asymptomatic spread. “We’re hopeful that our contributions to this work will help to advance the research in the interest of broadly accessible and minimally invasive testing,” John DiFiori, the NBA’s director of sports medicine, tells USA Today.
Characteristics that Give Viruses Pandemic Potential/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DKOSIG
E
ven before COVID-19 swept across the globe this year, coronaviruses were on scientists’ radar as pathogens that could one day ignite a pandemic. They’d threatened to before—in 2002–03, the SARS virus infected 8,000 people in more than two dozen countries and killed almost 800—and they checked off several specific boxes that emerging infectious disease specialists worry about in a virus. But they’re not the only group of viruses that researchers are concerned about. Influenza and a handful of other viruses have long been viewed as pandemic threats.
One aspect that signals pandemic potential in a virus is having an RNA, rather than DNA, genome. That’s because the process of copying RNA typically doesn’t include a proofreader like DNA replication does, and so RNA viruses have higher mutation rates than the DNA variety. “This means they can change and become more adaptable to human infection and human transmission,” says Steve Luby, an epidemiologist at Stanford University. 
Researchers on the lookout for dangerous pathogens also pay close attention to viruses with track records of leaping from animals to people. Smallpox, measles, Ebola, and HIV all originated in animals, as Luby estimates that 80 percent of our most devastating infections did. 
An RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections can evolve into something we haven’t seen before and spread rapidly.
—Ralph Baric, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
Once a virus makes the zoonotic leap from animals to humans, it must then transmit from one person to the next if it is to cause an epidemic. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 seems to outperform the original and deadlier SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and some bird flu strains. But these less-transmissible viruses could always acquire some new mutation that revs up their R0, the expected number of infections caused by one person, increasing their potential to spread rapidly through human populations, says Raina Plowright, an infectious disease researcher at Montana State University. 
How a virus is transmitted is yet another consideration when evaluating its pandemic potential. The most concerning situation is when a virus can spread through respiratory droplets, allowing it to jump from person to person through close interactions, as is the case for the seasonal flu and also SARS-CoV-2. “An RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections can evolve into something we haven’t seen before and spread rapidly,” says Ralph Baric, a virologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Measles, an RNA paramyxovirus spread through respiratory secretions, is perhaps the most contagious disease known in humans. 
As the world continues to grapple with SARS-CoV-2, The Scientist asked virologists to rank viruses with the greatest potential to cause a future pandemic. Three answers routinely popped up: influenza, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses, a large family of viruses that includes mumps and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as Nipah virus, which researchers say poses the biggest pandemic threat among them. “There are lots of concerns to keep communicable disease epidemiologists up at night,” says Luby. 
Influenza 
Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, most virologists rated influenza as the most likely agent to trigger a deadly pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic caused an estimated 50 million to 100 million deaths over two years, and there have been three flu pandemics since—in 1957–58, in 1968, and most recently in 2009.
Influenza is an RNA virus and thus prone to mutation, which necessitates a new seasonal flu vaccine each year. Virologists classify influenza strains according to two surface proteins: the hemagglutinin (H) protein that binds to a receptor on target cells and the neuraminidase (N) protein that virus particles use to escape host cells. There are 18 hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 neuraminidase subtypes. It’s likely that all permutations occur influenza viruses that affect in influenza viruses that affect birds but only a handful have cropped up in those that infect people. “Over the last one hundred or so years, we have had pandemics and seasonal epidemics caused by only three of the eighteen H subtypes and two of the eleven N subtypes,” says virologist Kanta Subbarao, director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne.
From time to time, influenza viruses in ducks and shorebirds spill over to infect domestic poultry and sometimes pigs. The H protein is critical. Concern mounts whenever the H protein of a bird flu virus gains the ability to infect human cells. This allows the virus to jump to humans, introducing people to a new strain with avian proteins to which they have little or no immunity. So far, says Luby, “the H7N9 and H5N1 viruses still primarily connect to the cellular receptors in birds, but sometimes they infect people and cause serious disease.” 
The concern is that some of the viruses with killer characteristics might change in a way that allows them to more easily spread from person to person. Indeed, influenza has a radical way to shapeshift. Its RNA genome is split into eight segments. When two different subtypes of virus, be they bird or mammalian strains, are in one cell, viral segments can be shuffled to create entirely new strains. Pigs are suspected to be ideal viral melting pots. “Pigs carry similar receptors to humans, and they can be infected by avian and mammalian viruses,” says Subbarao. “The 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics were caused by reassortant viruses, with some gene segments from avian influenza viruses and other segments from circulating human flu viruses. It is long proposed that this [mixing] happened in an intermediate host, possibly pigs.”
The WHO has a constellation of national labs to watch for emerging strains of flu, and now collaborates closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health. “We want to pick up any novel influenza viruses in animals,” Subbarao explains. Scientists recently became concerned, for example, when a swine influenza variant of H1N1, called G4, circulating in pigs was shown to be able to infect and replicate in human epithelial cells. The virus carries genes from the H1N1 subtype that caused the 2009 flu pandemic. 
Pandemic pathogens are rare, however, and are by their nature difficult to predict. “We do know there are some things we should worry about,” Luby says, yet “we tend to get caught off guard.”

Coronavirus
Both the SARS and MERS coronaviruses are deadlier than SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, human-to-human transmission of SARS and MERS is relatively low. But there is a tremendous diversity of coronaviruses in bat species. They mostly infect the gut, but can replicate in lung tissue as well. After the SARS outbreak in 2002–03, scientists searched for coronaviruses in bats in Chinese caves and found a trove of them in common insectivorous species. Moreover, antibodies identified in the blood of people in southern China suggest that some human populations are routinely exposed to bat coronaviruses. This gives the viruses ample opportunity to adapt to people. 
Harbingers of coronaviruses’ propensity to jump to new species are the lethal outbreaks that often occur on farms. Three devastating swine coronavirus strains have emerged in pigs in the last couple of decades. “These viruses are on the move,” says Baric. He worries that we have “toggled on a switch” to promote coronavirus emergence from animal reservoirs into other mammalian species, including ourselves. This is mostly linked to human behavior, such as consumption and farming of wild animals in certain countries. “Markets where lots of animals are in cages together can mean more animal transmission and more humans getting infected,” says Luby, who says he believes China should close all its wet markets. 
Our immediate highest risk is coronaviruses.
—Steve Luby, Stanford University
The current coronavirus pandemic along with the first SARS outbreak are not the first we have experienced. MERS coronavirus seems to have been in camels for decades, occasionally infecting people. It has now caused 2,400 cases, mostly in the Arabian Peninsula. Some virologists say that the coronaviruses that are now endemic in people, causing common cold symptoms, may have sparked deadly pandemics when they first made the jump from animals to humans. The OC43 coronavirus, for example, seems to have come from bats via cattle and there is evidence that it caused a pandemic in the 1890s, says Baric. 
Now, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some researchers rank coronaviruses as the biggest threat. “I’d put coronavirus ahead of flu,” says Luby. “It demonstrated higher case fatality—not with SARS-CoV-2, but we have seen it with SARS and MERS,” and it looks like the live markets in China are allowing coronaviruses associated with bats to spread to other mammals. “Our immediate highest risk is coronaviruses.” 
Nipah virus
In 1994, a mysterious disease broke out in horses in a suburb of Brisbane, Australia, called Hendra. Twenty-one horses fell severely ill from a pathogen that was soon named Hendra virus. Then, a vet attending to the sick horses died from the virus, whose origin was traced to fruit bats in the genus Pteropus (aka, flying foxes). Four years later, a related virus called Nipah virus was identified as the cause of an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia. Two million infected pigs were slaughtered, halting the outbreak. In 2001, researchers realized that outbreaks of Nipah virus in people happened each year in Bangladesh, primarily from people drinking the sap of date trees that was contaminated with bat urine. But there didn’t appear to be human-to-human transmission. 
In 2018, however, an outbreak in southern India suggested that human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was possible through close contact. A 27-year-old villager, who may have contracted the virus from fruit contaminated by bat saliva or urine, was admitted to the hospital in Kerala state and infected nine other people, including fellow patients, visiting relatives, and medical staff. He was referred to another hospital, where more patients and medical workers were infected. Twenty-one of the 23 infected people died from severe respiratory sickness and/or brain inflammation. “One reason it doesn’t take off is because it makes people so sick so quickly that they tend to be hospitalized and isolated,” says Plowright, who studies bats and Nipah virus outbreaks. But Nipah virus’s fatality rate of between 50 percent and 100 percent is exactly what makes it such a concern. 
Nipah and Hendra belong to a group of paramyxoviruses now called henipavirus, and there are many more strains harbored in flying foxes in Asia, Oceania, and Africa, says Plowright. Although henipaviruses have not yet caused widespread outbreaks in people, other paramyxoviruses, such as measles and mumps, have. “Some of these viruses spread really well,” says Rebecca Dutch, a molecular biologist at the University of Kentucky. If Nipah moved efficiently from one person to another, perhaps mutating so it transmits before making someone really sick, “this would be devasting,” says Luby, “more like the Black Plague.”

Other potential threats
Viruses that did not top the list but still demand attention are filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus, which cause hemorrhagic fever and can infect apes, monkeys, and bats, in addition to humans. “The fact that Ebola requires blood or body fluids to be transmitted means that it is harder to transmit and so less likely to be a global threat,” explains Luby. And as with Nipah virus infections, people get sick quickly and thus are isolated early. For a filovirus to cause a pandemic, it would need to be transmissible in respiratory form or spread readily in diarrhea, experts say, and it’s not yet clear how easily that might happen. “The big question is, what is the diversity of the Ebola viruses in nature?” says Baric. 
Other viruses that scientists are keeping tabs on include those in the Bunyavirus and Arenavirus families, which primarily infect rodents, and mosquito-transmitted dengue, Zika virus, and West Nile virus. “Vector-borne pathogens have the potential to infect two billion people,” says Baric, “but if you are in the northern latitudes it may be low risk for you.” As the geographical range of mosquitoes spreads to higher latitudes with climate change, however, so too will the diversity of the pathogens they carry. 
There is also “disease X.” The WHO uses this term to acknowledge that a serious epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease. But studying an undescribed pathogen is a tall order. “Until SARS emerged in 2002, those who study coronaviruses had trouble getting anyone to fund their research,” says Dutch. “There certainly could be things out there we don’t know about.” 
Experts warn that humans are creating conditions for more viral spillover events by disrupting natural habitats and by packing different wild animals together in wildlife markets. “We are creating the perfect storm for new viruses to emerge,” says Plowright, who recently coauthored a review on bat-borne virus diversity, spillover, and emergence. Despite this, the scientific community is largely unable to accurately forecast future outbreaks, she adds. “No one predicted that a flu pandemic [2009] would come from pigs in Mexico,” says Plowright. “We have to keep an open mind as to what the next pathogen outbreak is going to be.” 
But researchers are hopeful that our experience with COVID-19 will turn the tide of pandemic preparedness. As Luby says, “I anticipate there will be more attention to these threats.”

Doctors Forge Ahead with Plasma for COVID-19, Benefits Uncertain/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, AKIROMARU
B
eginning early on in the coronavirus pandemic, some researchers looked to experiences of past outbreaks for lessons, proposing that some patients might be saved by a decidedly old-fashioned remedy: plasma taken from people who’d recovered from the disease in infused into patients. The idea is that such plasma contains antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that can give patients’ immune systems a boost in fighting the disease. The approach caught on. Presently, about 1,500 patients a day are receiving this treatment in the US, Buzzfeed reports—but convalescent plasma’s very popularity is making it difficult to get solid answers on whether the remedy really works, and for whom.
“Without a randomized control trial, it’s very difficult to be certain that what you have is meaningful,” epidemiologist W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University tells The New York Times. Lipkin had been conducting such a trial, in which patients are randomly assigned to receive either plasma or a placebo, but the outbreak in New York died down before the trial had enrolled enough participants. Lipkin says he looked for partners in other areas of the US to help continue the study, but had a hard time finding them because patients and their doctors are reluctant to participate knowing they might receive the placebo. 
Since early April, many patients have been receiving plasma outside of clinical trials through a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–sanctioned program run by the Mayo Clinic. That initiative had published a preprint last month indicating that the plasma treatment is safe, and this week it put out further results on 35,322 treated patients indicating that those who received infusions with a greater concentration of antibodies, and those who received the treatment earlier in their illness, were more likely to survive than patients who received less–antibody-rich plasma or received it later.
But the Mayo study does not include a control group, and randomized controlled trials that have been completed on convalescent plasma for COVID-19 have been much smaller. In one study published in JAMA in June, researchers based in China reported that they did not find a statistically significant difference in recovery within 28 days for patients who received the treatment, but they had only managed to enroll 103 patients in the trial and they wrote in their report that it “may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.”
See “FDA to Allow for Plasma Therapy for COVID-19 Patients”
Trials in the US have similarly stalled due to an inability to recruit enough patients, the Times reports, and meanwhile, its sources say that the FDA is preparing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma that could further expand its use. 
The Mayo Clinic’s new study “raises the question of what strength of evidence is necessary to treat during a pandemic,” says Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale New Haven Hospital, in comments to STAT. “The problem is we have yet to resolve what is sufficient evidence to change the treatment paradigm.”
Even if convalescent plasma has benefit, it “was never intended to be the final treatment for a disease,” infectious disease expert Nicole Bouvier of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who is involved with the Mayo study tells BuzzFeed. “It gives us more time to work on making other therapeutics.”

he speed of the COVID-19 outbreak has forced humanity to conduct research, craft policies, and make decisions at an unprecedented rate, outside of wartime. The pandemic has highlighted and amplified some of the cracks in these processes. I present evidence of these failings in my book, The State of Science. COVID-19 is truly a wicked problem. Because of its contradictory, incomplete, intertwined, and rapidly changing components, the pandemic seems resistant to resolution.
Epidemiologists have been predicting and preparing for a viral outbreak such as COVID-19 for many years. Live animal markets, which can act as viral mixing bowls; increased world travel; and population density have made a pandemic pretty much inevitable. Despite this, we weren’t ready. The combined budgets of federal agencies that might have funded and conducted research to better prepare the US for this situation—specifically the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation—are only 7 percent of what the United States spends on defense. The country was prepared for terrorist attacks and war, but not SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the pandemic has highlighted not only the lack of scientific knowledge among elected officials, but the devaluation of scientific expertise, as well as the consequences of budget cuts in government science agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
A whole section of my latest book, The State of Science, is devoted to “bad science,” which is research mispresented for personal or political gain. During the pandemic, it has been more important than ever to get peer-reviewed information out quickly. But the peer-review process is not designed for quick turnaround times. The researchers most qualified to review virology, epidemiology, and modeling papers are working on COVID-19 projects and don’t have time to review papers. Preprint servers should have filled the void, but they were swamped by COVID-19 submissions. As the crisis grew initially, everyone was an expert, everyone wanted a slice of the pie, and there weren’t enough experts doing thorough quality control. These conditions resulted in a breeding ground for bad science and misinformation. 
PROMETHEUS, JULY 2020
The internet has grown from one website in 1991 to more than 1.6 billion in 2018. We have instant access to more news and information than ever before. Neighborhood gossip has been magnified by websites and social media. Manlio De Domenico is the head of the Complex Multilayer Networks Research Unit at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy. He and his colleagues used machine learning to analyze more than 112 million COVID-related tweets in 64 languages About 30 percent of those posts were from “unreliable” sources, as defined by nine publicly available databases such as MediaBias/FactCheck. Waves of unreliable and low-quality information preceded the arrival of the epidemic, exposing countries to irrational social behavior and serious threats to public health. De Domenico’s team also tracked the level of misinformation rising exponentially and then, in some countries, falling as the pandemic progressed. In places where misinformation eventually decreased, local leaders tended to play their part and stop spreading misinformation themselves. For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in quantum chemistry, has gained her nation’s trust. She has relied heavily and very publicly on the expertise of a handful of qualified experts. US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have not done the same. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased focus on science, which ironically has an associated risk of further eroding the public’s trust in science, especially amongst those who do not understand the nonlinear, consensus-establishing nature of scientific research. Today’s high-profile expert assertions can be disproven by tomorrow’s events, but this is not a shortcoming of science. This is how science works. Epidemiological models, like climate models, are mathematical tools designed to predicted the probability (with large error bars) of certain outcomes under a prescribed set of conditions and assumptions. They are not crystal balls.
When asked what keeps him awake at night, virologist Christian Drosten recently told The Guardian about something he calls the “prevention paradox.” If social distancing works and the curve is flattened people will ask: “Why did we close businesses? Why did we overreact?” Anti-vaxxers commonly use this argument when they claim that the low rates of diseases that are vaccinated against are evidence that the vaccine wasn’t needed in the first place. If all of our mitigation efforts and preventive actions work, the outcome is that we don’t get sick. But not being sick was the state we were in before we took those actions, so it could appear as if science did nothing. If science works to stem the spread and toll of COVID-19, will it reflect badly on science, at least in the public’s eyes?
To mitigate COVID-19 resurgence and to prevent future pandemics, trust in science and global cooperation is essential. The US’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, along with similarly isolating policy decisions, are not going to help. It will just antagonize our allies, which may further weaken our medical supply chains and endanger our epidemiological early warning systems. The reckless COVID-19 blame-game and associated political machinations are endangering US-China cooperation and America’s influence overseas at a time when global cooperation in scientific inquiry is desperately required to deal with the virus.

Coronavirus Found on Food Packaging, but Likely of Little Concern/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FOTOFROG
T
here is growing evidence that food packaging is transporting SARS-CoV-2 across international borders. Several countries are linked to either exported or imported frozen food that tested positive for traces of the virus, but experts say they believe the risk of developing COVID-19 from handling these products remains extremely low.
“The number of virus particles coming out a person’s mouth or nose is far greater than a few virus particles remaining on frozen foods, somebody touching it and then spreading it,” T. Jacob John, a retired virologist at Christian Medical College, tells Reuters. “Among all the risks, I think these are very low risks.”
China has reported the most cases of packaging contamination, according to NBC News, due in part to a massive screening effort targeting imported goods across the country. Last month, Chinese health officials found traces of the coronavirus on frozen goods imported into the cities of Dalian, Xiamen, and Pingxiang. In the last four days, similar findings have been reported in Wuhu and Shenzhen, linked to frozen shrimp and chicken wings imported from Ecuador and Brazil, respectively, and to frozen seafood of unnamed origins arriving in the port city of Yantai.
After New Zealand reported its first new cases of COVID-19 in more than three months, contact tracing revealed that one of the infected people worked in an import receiving facility, The Guardian reports. As a result, public officials are considering the possibility that the virus arrived in the country on freight. The facility is currently being tested to rule it out. “We can see the seriousness of the situation we are in,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news conference. “It’s being dealt with in an urgent but calm and methodical way.”
Previous research has shown that the virus can remain on packaging for hours or even days, depending on the type of material and the ambient conditions. For paper and plastic, the materials related to the most recent reports, that time varies between four to five days, Reuters reports, although other studies have given different ranges. Among the cases in China and New Zealand, it’s difficult to know just when the virus was introduced onto the contaminated surfaces. It could have happened at any point along the transport chain.
See “SARS-CoV-2 Can Live on Plastic and Steel for 2–3 Days”
Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dismiss the idea that disease transmission on packaging is a serious concern. 
The WHO says it is “highly unlikely that people can contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging,” due to the fact that coronaviruses require a living host to multiply. Outside a body, they gradually become weaker and lose the ability to actively infect. In a June memo, the CDC similarly claimed that the risk of infection from food products or bags is “thought to be very low.” Remnants of dead virus have been known to cause false positive results in recovered patients, CNN reports.
Researchers have taken to scientific journals to downplay transmission by fomites, a term for the surfaces themselves. In a recent commentary in The Lancet, Emanuel Goldman, a microbiologist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said, “the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface, and someone else touches that surface soon after.”
Speaking to The Atlantic in July, Goldman stated his position more emphatically: “Surface transmission of COVID-19 is not justified at all by the science.”
Trials Seek to Answer if Vitamin D Could Help in COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

A
few years back, respiratory physician Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University of London and colleagues analyzed data from about 11,000 participants in 25 trials that tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of contracting an acute respiratory tract infection such as influenza. They determined that taking a daily or weekly dose of vitamin D was protective against infections and safe overall. People with the lowest starting vitamin D levels benefitted the most from supplementation.
When David Meltzer, an internist and economist at the University of Chicago, saw that analysis earlier this year, he decided to look into a possible connection between vitamin D and COVID-19. There was good reason to do so. Groups who are often low in vitamin D—such as African Americans, who tend to have darker skin in which higher melanin levels limit UV rays from fueling vitamin D production, and the elderly—were being hit especially hard by the disease. Meltzer and his colleagues went back through the medical records of people who had been tested for COVID-19 in Chicago between March 3 and April 10 and measured the relationship between vitamin D levels in the past year and positive tests. “The people who were vitamin D deficient were dramatically more likely to have COVID than the people who weren’t vitamin D deficient,” says Meltzer, who, along with his coauthors, published the results as a preprint on medRxiv in May.
Another study from Israel, published July 23 in The FEBS Journal, likewise found a link between low levels of vitamin D and increased COVID-19 susceptibility.
Such correlative evidence has fueled studies on whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent or treat COVID-19, but there are plenty of open questions. For one, too much vitamin D can lead to an excess of calcium in the blood and, in severe cases, organ damage, so determining the correct amount to give will be essential. And the correlational evidence doesn’t all agree. For instance, a study of people in the United Kingdom published in May in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews did not find evidence for a link between vitamin D levels and getting COVID-19 or having a poorer prognosis afterwards. Based on the conflicting evidence, it’s not clear whether the supplement is right for everyone.
Meltzer adds that it’s also not clear whether vitamin D deficiency is causing or reflecting individuals’ increased susceptibility. There are lots of reasons—including age, chronic illness, and spending time indoors—why low vitamin D could be correlated with the likelihood of testing positive, Meltzer explains. In the study, the researchers controlled for these potentially confounding factors, “but we can’t control for everything,” he says.
The best way to determine whether or not vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 is to perform randomized controlled trials, he adds—something he and his colleagues are working on in multiple populations, including first responders.
Immunity and vitamin D
Carol Wagner, a neonatologist at the Medical University of South Carolina, has studied vitamin D in clinical trials since 2000, often in pregnant and lactating women. Initially, researchers thought that vitamin D’s role in the body was limited to its functions in bone health and calcium metabolism, she says, and the ways in which it affects immune function were mostly ignored.
“When you start looking at differences in immune function of those who are vitamin D replete versus those who are not, you see really clear, elegant work from many labs around the globe identifying vitamin D’s role in not only innate but adaptive immunity,” she says. And more people these days are vitamin D deficient because we now spend much more time inside and use sunscreen—both of which limit exposure to the sun’s UV rays, a prime source of vitamin D.
Based on the data that we got there, it seems like a moderate dose is potentially more effective than these much higher doses that some people have been promoting.
—Adrian Martineau, Queen Mary University of London
An immune role for vitamin D has been confirmed in clinical studies demonstrating that people with lower levels of vitamin D are more prone to infections, both bacterial and viral, and by lab-based findings demonstrating that vitamin D upregulates the expression of immune-related genes. Based on this evidence, Wagner and colleagues began recruiting participants in July for a randomized clinical trial to investigate whether vitamin D supplements can help prevent COVID-19 or lessen the disease’s severity.
Theirs is just one of about 30 entries on clinicaltrials.gov that either explore the link between low levels of vitamin D and COVID-19 or test the effectiveness of vitamin D supplements in preventing or treating the disease. Similar studies that aren’t referenced in clinicaltrials.gov are in the works, including a large, population-based trial Queen Mary University’s Martineau and colleagues are setting up now.
“From the lab, there’s a convincing story that vitamin D should be beneficial. It’s doing the right sort of stuff, in terms of upregulating a whole host of innate antiviral immune mechanisms and also simultaneously dampening down inflammatory responses that we know in COVID-19 are particularly harmful,” Martineau explains. Clinical trials are still necessary, he says, because “there’s a lot of observational data out there linking lower vitamin D levels to either heightened susceptibility or poorer outcomes, but these are limited in quality in that they can’t really pull apart confounding or reverse causality, which could also explain these associations.”
Getting the dose right
Part of the challenge in sussing out the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of viral infections comes from the heterogeneity and the lack of generalizability of previous clinical trials, says Jill Weatherhead, an infectious disease physician at Baylor College of Medicine. “There are differences in methodology, differences in vitamin D supplement regimens, [and] differences in participant characterization.”
The current clinical trials to evaluate the link between vitamin D and COVID-19 also differ in some of these aspects. In the MUSC trial, people 50 years and older will be tested for COVID-19. If they’re negative, they’ll receive either 6,000 international units (IU)—about 150 micrograms—of vitamin D or a placebo daily. If they test positive, they’ll get a bolus of 20,000 IU or a placebo bolus once a day for three days and then 6,000 IU or placebos daily after. Each participant in both the test and control groups will also get a daily multivitamin containing 800 IU of vitamin D. The 6,000 IU daily dose and 20,000 IU bolus are both doses that have been shown to be safe in previous work.
People need to be cautious about what vitamins and supplements they’re taking because some do cause harm.
—Jill Weatherhead, Baylor College of Medicine
In trials being planned by Martineau and colleagues in the UK, the dose will likely be lower, based on an update to their 2017 meta-analysis that they posted on medRxiv in July. They used primary data from more than 29,000 patients in 39 randomized trials to determine that the daily dose of vitamin D that provides the best protection against respiratory infections is between 400 and 1,000 IU.
“Until we’d done this exercise, I would have been saying that something like two to four thousand [IU] a day is probably optimal—just from the grounds that it takes vitamin D status more reliably to the therapeutic range, but actually, based on the data that we got there, it seems like a moderate dose is potentially more effective than these much higher doses that some people have been promoting,” Martineau says. It’s important to “highlight, though, that this is for acute respiratory infections in general. None of these studies would have been done in COVID, so you can’t generalize too enthusiastically.”
Part of the issue with dosing, according to Meltzer, is that it’s not clear what optimal levels of vitamin D are. The daily recommended dietary allowance from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies is 600–800 IU of vitamin D for adults, he says, but “if you look at people who are out in the sun all the time, like lifeguards, they have higher vitamin D levels . . . probably twice or more than what they are in the average American. Yet, most of those people don’t have any problem at all with high calcium levels,” which is one of the possible dangers of taking too much of the vitamin.
“I’m not advocating that people take ten thousand units a day in an uncontrolled environment, but do I think it’s in the realm of what should be studied? Absolutely,” he continues, adding that there’s also the possibility that a dose that’s too low could end up in a subtherapeutic range.
Until the results of clinical trials are available, “people need to be cautious about what vitamins and supplements they’re taking because some do cause harm,” Weatherhead cautions, pointing to the possible side effects, as well as potential interactions of vitamin D with other drugs people might be taking. “Use of supplements with the recommended daily intake is not an unreasonable approach,” she adds. “It’s a balance.”
“We know that vitamin D is good for bones and muscles,” says Martineau. “Therefore, it makes sense to take a bit, and it might just help against COVID, too.”
Simple Tool Evaluates Mask Performance at Blocking Droplets/-/ABOVE: SHAWN ROCCO/DUKE HEALTH PHOTOGRAPHY
M
asks have emerged as one of the most important public health initiatives of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they come in so many forms, it can be difficult to know which ones work best at blocking respiratory droplets and tiny airborne spray. 
A study published August 7 in Science Advances as a proof of concept details a new method for easily visualizing the droplets emitted while speaking and the rough efficiency of different types of masks in minimizing their spread. The authors used a cheap but powerful laser to create a screen of light that scatters when particles pass through. Of the dozen or so masks they tested, some did a much better job at dampening the number of particles detected by the laser.
“We know that all masks are not created equal,” Erica Shenoy, the associate chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved in the study, tells The Scientist in an email. “This study corroborates differences in relative performance of many of the types of masks that we are all seeing every day when out and about in public.”
The impetus for the project came when an out-of-work ballet costume designer sent Eric Westman, a specialist in obesity medicine at Duke University Health System, a message on social media. She had heard that Westman was working to source and manufacture masks for vulnerable citizens, and she wanted to offer her team of unemployed costume makers. “These people who are used to using these fabrics for ballroom costumes . . . were now using this beautiful material” to make masks, Westman says.
See “How Face Masks Prevent the Spread of COVID-19”
Westman needed a simple way to test the effectiveness of the different materials, so he picked up the phone and called the physics department at Duke University. Martin Fischer, an expert in biomedical imaging, took up the challenge, bringing in his college-aged daughter so the two could work closely without fear of passing the virus to others.
Together, they built a simple tool out of a cardboard box, a laser, a lens, and a smartphone camera capable of capturing visible evidence of airborne particles. Fischer used a cylindrical lens to stretch the pencil-like beam of the laser into a thin “light sheet,” passing it through slits in the sides of a blackened box. When a person speaks into the box, the particles cross through the light sheet, scattering the light in different directions. A camera on the other end records that scatter, which appears on the video as winking green lights, and a simple computer algorithm tallies the number of droplets and the rate at which they pass through the sheet. The whole setup costs just under $200.
DUKE HEALTH
“I think it’s really important what they were able to do in terms of using a laser light scattering method that can be implemented cheaply and easily, so that people can really see the effect,” Christina Bax, a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research, tells The Scientist. Earlier this year, Bax had worked with colleagues at NIH who developed a similar technique, and found that when speaking, “everybody has saliva droplets flying everywhere.”
Fischer’s team tested the ability of 14 different masks to dampen the spread of those droplets, including the medical grade N95s (with and without valves) used by frontline healthcare workers, disposable blue surgical masks, hand-sewn cotton masks, neck fleeces, and bandanas, among others. A single person spoke the phrase “stay healthy, people” five times in a row into the box, a process that was repeated 10 times for each mask and for the no-mask control.
See “Scientists Urge Consideration of Airborne SARS-CoV-2 Transmission”
The results, Fisher says, were “an eye opener for how many of those particles are floating around” even when people are just talking. When speaking without masks, Westman and Fischer found that people exhale hundreds of drops per second, many of which are too small to be detected by the naked eye but still flashed green inside the box.
Among the many masks they tested, the N95 with no valve performed best, with only 0.1 percent of the particles making it through the light sheet; the version with the valve may do a good job of protecting the wearer, but it still allows particles to escape when a person breathes out. Hand-sewn cotton masks composed of at least two layers also performed well, as did single-use surgical masks, vastly decreasing the number of particles spreading into the air while talking.
But cotton bandanas and Buff-type neck gaiters made of spandex performed poorly, and in fact  sometimes caused more drops to pass across the beam than had been detected in the control. The authors attribute this finding to a sort of cheese grater effect: larger particles passing through the porous material were broken up into smaller aerosols. “I came in thinking anything is better than nothing,” Westman says. “But the idea that it’s a mesh can change the dynamic.”
This study is only a proof of concept meant to show the utility of the laser setup and not to draw broad conclusions about the efficacy of different masks. The researchers sampled only what was at hand and used only one speaker to test all 14 types. It is likely, the authors say, that variations between individuals based on tone, volume, enunciation, and even language, as well as differences in fabric quality and the fit of a mask, might change their findings. If backed up by further study, the results suggest that scarce N95 masks are best left for frontline workers, as average citizens can make do with masks made at home.
In addition to the relatively small sample size, Shenoy adds, it is possible that not all droplets were captured in the count due to the experimental set up and limitations in the detection sensitivity of the cell phone camera, especially for smaller particles. 
See “How Our Exhalations Help Spread Pathogens Such as SARS-CoV-2”
The authors, who are currently attempting to patent their new product, envision it being used in public community centers or museums as an educational tool to show people why masks are so important and how best to wear them. In addition, it may be useful for companies manufacturing masks to easily test the efficacy of their product, or in resource-poor countries as a cheaper alternative to costly laser particle sorters. According to Bax, “it comes back to this idea of being able to visualize what is happening, visualize the droplets, and understand that everybody spits when they speak.”
Gilead Urged to Explore Remdesivir Relative as COVID-19 Drug/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TOMSMITH585
Update (August 25): The National Institutes of Health has said it will be conducting preclinical research on GS-441524 as a potential COVID-19 treatment. In a letter dated August 20, the director of the agency’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences wrote: “We are planning to independently test the therapeutic hypothesis for GS-441524 in treating SARS-CoV-2. . . . We expect to conduct these studies quickly and make the results available to the research community for further consideration.”
G
ilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, is under pressure from citizen advocates to launch clinical trials on COVID-19 patients of another of its compounds—one that advocates claim could be cheaper, easier to make, and more effective at treating the novel coronavirus.
Remdesivir is currently the only medication to have emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In a letter posted last week (August 4), the Washington-based advocacy organization Public Citizen urged the company to focus on GS-441524, a compound that is chemically similar to remdesivir and has been used to treat cats infected with a different, feline-specific coronavirus.
The letter presses Gilead and government health agencies to “either work collaboratively to promptly pursue the development of the experimental antiviral drug GS-441524 . . . as a treatment for [COVID-19] or publicly provide evidence why it is not scientifically or medically feasible to develop this drug in parallel with its close analogue, remdesivir.”
The organization isn’t the first to highlight the possibility of repurposing drugs used to treat feline coronavirus. An in vitro study posted as a preprint in May by researchers in Canada suggested that another drug used to treat viral infections in cats, GC376, could inhibit an enzyme that SARS-CoV-2 needs in order to replicate. The company with the license for that compound, California-based Anivive Lifesciences, is reportedly planning clinical trials, according to Science News.
Neither compound has received FDA approval in cats with feline coronavirus infections, let alone in people with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Gilead tells the Chicago Tribune that the company is working on preclinical studies with GS-441524, which, unlike remdesivir, had not been formally tested in people prior to the pandemic. Remdesivir had gone through rapid clinical trials during the West African Ebola epidemic of 2013 to 2016.
Derek Lowe, a drug discovery scientist and author of In the Pipeline, a well-known blog about the pharma industry, tells The Guardian that remdesivir and other antivirals such as GS-441524 will become less important to the public health response to COVID-19 as efforts to find other treatments and prophylaxes progress. “Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines are, to my eyes (and not just mine) the answer to this pandemic,” he says.

P
eople with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) suffer from a chronic, debilitating fatigue that can leave them unable to maintain a job or take part in normal activities. Because of the condition’s unclear pathology and root causes, the disease was long dismissed as a psychiatric illness by doctors and ignored by researchers. Today, it’s estimated that 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans suffer from the disease—the vast majority of them undiagnosed—and that the illness costs billions annually in medical bills and lost incomes.  
See “Could COVID-19 Trigger Chronic Disease in Some People?” 
Below are the diagnostic criteria for the disease, according to the National Academy of Medicine. 
Debilitating fatigue
ME/CFS patients typically recall a sudden onset of a profound fatigue that lasts longer than six months and significantly reduces their ability to engage in normal activities.  
Post-exertional malaise
The hallmark of the condition is a worsening of symptoms 12–48 hours after physical or mental activity, which can leave patients bedridden for days or weeks. 
Unrefreshing sleep
Even a full night’s worth of sleep doesn’t improve symptoms, and patients often feel just as exhausted after waking up.  
Cognitive problems
Many ME/CFS patients experience difficulties remembering things, processing new information, or concentrating. 
Orthostatic intolerance
Some patients’ symptoms worsen after standing or sitting upright, exacerbating their fatigue and cognitive problems.  
Other symptoms
Some ME/CFS patients also report a racing heart, a sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, headaches, and muscle and joint pain.
THE SCIENTIST STAFF
What causes ME/CFS?  
Scientists still don’t know what causes ME/CFS, which has hampered efforts to develop treatments and diagnostic tests for the disease. However, there are several factors that appear to be involved.
Viral infections
Many ME/CFS patients report having a viral infection prior to the onset of their symptoms, leading researchers to suspect that viruses could be involved in triggering the disease in some people.  
Immune system
Based on findings of immune abnormalities in some ME/CFS patients, such as elevated levels of certain cytokines or poorly functioning immune cells, some researchers think the immune system may play a role in the disease’s pathology.  
Energy and metabolism
Several studies have documented differences between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in the way certain cells source their energy, which some researchers have suggested could explain the fatigue associated with the disease. 
Nervous system
Investigations into ME/CFS patients’ brains and the autonomic nervous system—which controls functions such as body temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate—have revealed abnormalities in some patients. 
Genetic factors
Observations from family and twin studies suggest that the risk for ME/CFS could be partly determined by genetics, but specific gene variants associated with the disease have remained elusive.

Russia Approves World’s First Coronavirus Vaccine/-/Vladimir Putin in Serbia, October 2014
ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DICUS63
R
ussian President Vladimir Putin announced today (August 11) that his country had won the global race to approve a vaccine against COVID-19, several news outlets have reported. Despite having only been in clinical trials for less than two months, the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow is safe, Putin said at a televised cabinet meeting, noting that it has already been given to one of his daughters, according to Reuters and The Washington Post. The government plans to first vaccinate high-risk groups such as healthcare workers and teachers, with mass vaccination starting in October after large-scale production begins, according to the Associated Press.
“It works effectively enough, forms a stable immunity and, I repeat, it has gone through all necessary tests,” Putin said at the meeting, according to The New York Times.
Researchers around the world, including in Russia, expressed worries that Gamaleya and its collaborators may be cutting corners of vaccine development, with no safety or immunity data yet released from ongoing early stage trials, and no Phase 3 trial yet underway. “Fast-tracked approval will not make Russia the leader in the (vaccine) race, it will just expose consumers of the vaccine to unnecessary danger,” Russia’s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations said Monday as it cautioned against the vaccine’s premature approval, according to the AP.
“The collateral damage from release of any vaccine that was less than safe and effective would exacerbate our current problems insurmountably,” agrees Imperial College London immunologist Danny Altmann in a statement quoted by several news outlets.
The vaccine uses an adenovirus vector studded with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. According to the AP, Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, told reporters this week that Phase 3 testing in the UAE, Saudia Arabia, the Philippines, and elsewhere could start as early as tomorrow and include “several thousand people.”
See “COVID Vaccine Frontrunners”
The World Health Organization (WHO), which last week urged Russia to follow international COVID vaccine development guidelines, according to the BBC, says it’s now in talks with the country for a possible “WHO prequalification,” according to Reuters.

A
s we all continue to grapple with the disruptive reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, most people are focused on the present and the near future. Will schools open in the fall? Are vaccine trials delivering promising results? When will this nightmare end, and what will the world look like in its aftermath? Not as much of our collective attention is being paid to the past. But the turbulent first half of 2020 has shown us that without the proper appreciation for the past, we are in danger of repeating mistakes or perpetuating injurious patterns.
Most recently, individuals across the world have been wrestling with systems in which the subjugation, oppression, and enslavement of entire groups of people has been commonplace for centuries. Properly contextualizing and understanding this shameful history is an obvious first step towards creating a better world and more loving societies for everyone. Absent this grounding in the past, a brighter future, free from racist ideologies and the scars they left, is virtually impossible.
A well-informed view of history might similarly facilitate living through and learning from the ongoing pandemic. Some commenters early on in the spread of COVID-19 offered hasty (and false) reassurances that COVID-19 was comparable to seasonal influenza. Claims that SARS-CoV-2’s prevalence would wane with the warming months of spring or that it wouldn’t exact a toll much beyond that of a bad flu season turned out to be wrong, as many people pointed out when such assertions were first voiced. But a little more than a century ago, a worldwide influenza pandemic killed at least 50 million people and perhaps as much as 100 million people. Studying the 1918 flu pandemic may help modern citizens, which comprise the descendants of those who survived that global catastrophe, cope with our own pathogenic present and future.
Experts aren’t sure where and when the 1918 flu outbreak started. An early cluster of cases on a US military base in Kansas could have been ground zero for the pandemic. The illness only became known as the “Spanish flu” as unfettered reports of infections and deaths emerged from Spain, which remained neutral throughout the course of the world war that had been raging in Europe for four years. In countries that were combatants in that multinational conflagration, the considerations of wartime propaganda and the projection of national strength outweighed the need to provide accurate and up-to-date epidemiological information on a disease that was racing rapidly around the globe.
If this obfuscation, which was aided by media outlets acquiescing to political strategies in warring countries, had been tempered by an urgency to disseminate quality health and disease information, perhaps the dreadful tide of the flu pandemic could have been stemmed to a degree. Today, politics and finger pointing are similarly hobbling the world’s ability to mount and sustain a robust and effective response to a widespread disease. Recently (July 21), with the US accounting for more than 25 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally and about 23 percent of deaths from the infection, President Donald Trump downplayed the situation, tweeting: “You will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus, but by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well - and we have done things that few other countries could have done!” And prior to this tweet, the Trump administration announced a policy shift that has hospitals bypass the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to send all COVID-19 patient information directly to a central database in Washington, DC. The CDC had shared its COVID-19 tallies publicly on its website, and cutting out this well-established, independent federal science agency from the process of reporting health information cast those data into the shadows of a political town.
Even if global politics seem to be repeating the mistakes of the past, medical care and science have made much progress in the century between these two pandemics. Right? Physicians in 1918 had essentially no evidence-based treatments—not even IV fluids, respirators, or vaccines—for the debilitating flu that seemed to sicken and kill both young and old. Some doctors and public health experts championed alcohol, laxatives, and bloodletting as treatments. Science wouldn’t even discover viruses, never mind that the causative agent for the 1918 pandemic was the H1N1 strain of influenza, for another couple of decades. Today, scientists were quick to identify the agent causing COVID-19, and researchers were doing detailed genomic analyses of the virus within weeks of the outbreak starting. But still, public figures have been proposing nonsensical treatments, such as silver-containing products and commercial disinfectants.
As we bide our collective time until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, tested, and disbursed, public health agencies around the globe have been recommending social measures that mirror what the public was asked to do during the 1918 pandemic. We are asked to practice physical distancing, to wear masks, and to curb social activities such as dining out, shopping, and bar hopping, just as our ancestors were during the uncertain times of their own global health catastrophe. 
When the 1918 flu hit San Francisco in September of that year, city leaders quickly enacted school closures, mandated mask wearing, and forbade gatherings, among other measures. Although the city recorded more than 2,000 cases of flu by mid-October, infections seemed to be trending downward, and the mask ordinance was annulled in late November. But flu cases began to rise, and by mid-January 1919, the city again mandated public mask wearing. Just one week later, the Anti-Mask League held a meeting that an estimated 4,000–5,000 people attended. This organization presented a petition to San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, and the mask ordinance was lifted citywide on February 1. The city would end up recording almost 45,000 cases and more than 3,000 confirmed deaths from the pandemic flu.
We are seeing these mistakes and others replaying in the US now. Young adults, often unmasked, crowd dance clubs, beaches, and bars, while vocal anti-mask factions have arisen in some localities and governors are suing mayors who seek to mandate mask wearing in their cities. And we might have avoided these pitfalls if we had a more robust appreciation for the history of pandemics past. 
Will we start to heed warnings from previous episodes of infectious peril as we find ourselves still very much in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic? I’m not terribly hopeful. But perhaps we can wrest some sense and strategy from our current and near-future experiences to help guide us through the next pandemic. My suspicion, based on solid scientific evidence from researchers who study emerging infectious diseases, is that it will not take another century for another one to befall us.

COVID-19 Lockdowns Will Have Negligible Effect on Climate Change/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GRAPHIKNATION
T
he current pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to study how global climate responds to a massive drop in human activity. And so far, it appears that lockdowns are likely to have little effect on climate change unless future economic recovery plans include green policies, according to a study published Thursday (August 6) in Nature Climate Change.
While previous research this spring had noted a 17 percent decline in carbon dioxide emissions worldwide associated with reduced human activity during the pandemic, the current study includes nine other greenhouse gases and relies on anonymized movement data gleaned from Google and Apple phones to track the activity of 4 billion people. In April 2020, the authors found, global emissions fell 10 percent to 30 percent as the world sheltered in place and businesses operated at a reduced capacity. The researchers caution that despite these sizable declines, the overall effect on climate may only amount to a decrease in the global temperature of 0.01 °C over the next five years.
“The fall in emissions we experienced during COVID-19 is temporary, and therefore it will do nothing to slow down climate change,” Corinne Le Quéré, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia and a coauthor on the new study, tells Science News. She notes that the response of global leaders in this moment could be “a turning point if they focus on a green recovery, helping to avoid severe impacts from climate change.” 
The results are the brainchild of a father-daughter pair who found themselves with time on their hands after daughter Harriet Forster’s exams at Queen Margaret’s School  were canceled. She decided to help her father Piers, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds, scrape and collate data on air quality and mobility to better understand how the emissions of 10 different greenhouse gases are changing during the pandemic. Mobility data can be linked to energy-consuming activities such as driving, working, and shopping that generate emissions.
Jenny Stavrakou, a climate scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy who was not involved in the study, tells Science News that the use of mobility data from cell phones is “an innovative approach” for estimating short-term changes. Many, although not all, greenhouse gases sit in the atmosphere for a long time, making it difficult to track smaller changes over days or months. “Mobility data have big advantages,” Stavrakou adds, because they are constantly updated and can be used to infer trends in gas emissions over much smaller timescales.
See “Analysis Links Poor Air Quality to Increased COVID-19 Deaths”
The Forsters and their colleagues pulled together many different datasets, including the previous research tracking carbon dioxide, and their study ultimately included information from 123 countries collected between February and June of 2020. In addition to the mobility data, they used air-quality monitoring stations from around the world to focus on shorter-lived greenhouse gases, Grist reports. Nitrogen dioxide, for example, is a useful proxy for quantifying carbon dioxide, as the two are released together during the burning of fossil fuels, but nitrogen dioxide dissipates much more quickly and is easier to assess trends  over the last few months of the pandemic.
While global emissions fell between 10 percent and 30 percent on average, the team found that the benefits were largely mitigated by the interplay between different gases. For example, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides fell by roughly 30 percent, a finding the authors attributed to less driving and use of public transportation. But at the same time, sulfur dioxides released by industry fell by 20 percent. While the former two gases increase global temperatures, sulfur dioxide actually cools the earth by forming aerosols that reflect incoming sunlight. 
Together, their findings suggest that the drop in emissions will be negligible in the long term. Peter Neff, a climate scientist at the University of Minnesota, tells Grist in an email these results show that “to have a good chance of limiting global warming to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C by 2050, we essentially need reduction in carbon emissions similar to that caused by the initial pandemic response every single year for the next decade and beyond.”
Some of the more positive climate aspects during the pandemic could be incorporated into policy moving forward, BBC News reports. For example, road traffic is still down in many places, and a shift towards greener transportation options could keep emissions lowered, as could the decision to retain some level of telework in the future. Stimulus money could be funneled into emerging renewable technologies and electric cars. The authors stress that if the world returns to its previous energy consumption behaviors, the odds of meeting the Paris Agreement threshold are very low.
Nevertheless, Pier Forster is optimistic that the challenge can be met. “Disasters are often historically the time of biggest change,” he tells BBC News. “For once, government, industry and public voices are all pretty aligned that green jobs and green investments are the way to build back better. We just need to do it.”
Self-Experimentation in the Time of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MARY HERRON

ong before there were rumors of COVID parties (decline your invitation), there were actual “filth parties,” and the guest list was exclusive. Joseph Goldberger, an infectious disease expert in the US Public Health Service, was tasked in 1914 with determining the cause of pellagra, a systemic disease known for its four Ds—dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death.
Many physicians at the time believed pellagra stemmed from an unknown germ, but Goldberger felt strongly, correctly, that it was the result of a nutritional deficiency. To prove it, he and his wife Mary held small gatherings during which they and a few brave volunteers  injected themselves with the blood of pellagra victims and ate the feces and urine of patients in pill form, what Mary called “the most nauseating diabolical concoctions,” according to a 2014 book detailing Joseph’s work. Goldberger repeated this spectacle multiple times in cities through the country to press his case. He died of cancer in 1929, but before then his work earned him four Nobel Prize nominations.

History is spattered with sometimes gruesome examples of medical self-experimentation, some of which have netted notoriety and reward, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. Across the world, researchers are offering up their own bodies to science in pursuit of a vaccine to treat infection with SARS-CoV-2, a virus that has so far killed more than 700,000 people and sickened more than 18.5 million worldwide.
“In the history of medicine, [self-experimentation] has certainly been a well-recognized tradition,” says Susan Lederer, a professor of the history of medicine and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin. “I would argue . . . it was almost required. The fact that you would risk it on your own body, or on your own children, was a sign of your good faith.”
In one of the more famous examples, Jonas Salk, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh, first tested his polio vaccine on himself and his children in 1952 before giving it to strangers. Marina Voroshilova and Mikhail Chumakov, a married pair of Russian polio experts, likewise self-administered a potential vaccine in 1959 before giving their three sons sugar cubes laced with weakened poliovirus. After a contentious debate over how to design and administer the vaccine, the consensus settled on an oral vaccine using live poliovirus. The disease was declared eradicated in the Western Hemisphere by the World Health Organization in 1994. 
Yellow fever vaccine development also inspired great self-sacrifice. A research team led by US Army physician Walter Reed arrived in Cuba at the end of the 19th century during the Spanish-American war to study the virus, which killed 13 soldiers for every one killed in battle. To establish that the disease was transmitted through mosquitoes, several of Reed’s colleagues intentionally exposed themselves to mosquitos that had previously fed on victims of yellow fever. Many of them got sick, and one man, Jesse Lazear, subsequently died. This early work prompted several successful mosquito-eradication programs that greatly reduced the number of cases, but it wasn’t until 1930 that Max Theiler, a virologist with the Rockefeller Foundation, began developing a vaccine that he first tested on himself. For his discovery, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1951.
See “Self-Experimentation Led to the Discovery of IgE”
Now, in the time of COVID-19, researchers in the United States have again begun sharing their experiences of testing their own vaccines. MIT Technology Review reports that Preston Estep, a cofounder of the citizen science initiative Rapid Deployment Vaccine Collaborative (Radvac), developed a nasal coronavirus vaccine and joined at least 20 other researchers, including Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church, in self-administering it. Last month, they shared details of their vaccine for others to copy, and have since lost track of how many people have used it.
Beyond the US, Chinese news media widely covered statements made in February by Huang Jinhai, an immunologist at Tianjin University, who claimed he had taken four doses of a vaccine developed in his lab even before it had been tested in animals. In late July, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said in a webinar that he too had been injected with an experimental vaccine, adding, “I hope it will work.” 
Similarly, the director of the Moscow-based Gamaleya Research Institute, Alexander Gintsburg, made headlines when he claimed to have tested a new COVID-19 vaccine on himself ahead of the start of human clinical trials. Days before, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had called self-experimenting scientists “fanatics in what they do in the best sense of the word.”
Nowadays, it isn’t only expert virologists who have access to the materials needed to create new vaccines. So-called “biohackers,” some of them scientists who have left academia to form independent groups, apply a DIY attitude toward manipulating the human body. Mild biohacking might be as simple as monitoring one’s sleep or exercise, but its more extreme forms can involve implanting computer chips under the skin or injecting oneself with CRISPR DNA, as Josiah Zayner did in 2017.   
Zayner and anther biohacker, Justin Atkin, have publicly hinted at or shared plans to inject themselves with DIY coronavirus vaccines and document their experiences on social media. Several videos shared as part of an ongoing investigation by MIT Technology Review reporter Antonio Regalado suggest that as many as 10 people may have already begun self-administering vaccines, although this cannot be confirmed.

Because they mix the vaccine themselves and administer it only to themselves, groups such as Radvac and biohackers like Zayner and Atkin have so far avoided the need for regulatory approval. But if subjecting oneself to an untested vaccine seems ethically or legally murky, that’s because it is.
There is no mention of self-experimentation in the Declaration of Helsinki—a set of ethical principles put in place by the World Medical Association in 1964 to govern human experimentation—or in the Nuremberg Code, a separate set of research ethics set down after atrocities committed during World War II. In a 2012 study detailing the history of self-experimentation in medicine, cardiologist and medical historian Allen Weisse claimed to have written to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Institute of Medicine about their policies and received no replies. 
The practice isn’t explicitly forbidden—it’s hard to argue against success—but it certainly isn’t encouraged. All research carried out on human subjects in the US must be approved by an institutional review board under the 1974 National Research Act, and most agencies also abide by the “Common Rule” requiring informed consent from participants and providing extra protection for at-risk groups such as prisoners, pregnant women, children, and fetuses. Otherwise, researchers can put themselves forward as candidates for treatments just as anyone else might.
The moral and ethical views surrounding self-experimentation therefore seem to be largely dictated by the medical community itself, and the practice has seemingly been falling out of favor, at least among Americans. 
Lederer says that people now “look askance” at scientists who subject themselves and their families to unregulated treatments. Weisse’s study identified 465 examples of self-experimentation in medical research in the 19th and 20th centuries, but only 82 of those instances that took place between 1950 and 1990. “The trend in recent years toward collaborative studies, often on a massive scale, makes self-experimentation by a single individual, tucked away in his laboratory, seem almost quaint, a relic of the past,” Weisse explains in his study.
See “Biohacker Injects DIY Herpes Vaccine on Facebook Live”
Still, the last Nobel Prize awarded for work involving self-experimentation was only five years ago, when Tu Youyou was honored for developing an anti-malaria drug that she first tested on herself. Lederer says it’s likely that self-experimentation more often goes unreported nowadays, even as it still happens. 
Amid the frenzy to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and the notoriety gained by biohacking, Lederer points to history as a sobering counterpoint. After testing his polio vaccine on himself, Salk launched a massive trial involving more than 200,000 children. In what became known as the Cutter incident, the company charged with developing the vaccine failed to sufficiently neutralize the virus before adding it to the vaccine, resulting in 40,000 cases of polio and 10 deaths.
Self-experimentation is likely to remain a murky, fringe endeavor. Reflecting back on over 200 years of medical advancement, Weisse shared this parting thought: “My own conclusion is that, despite some unwise decisions in the past to indulge in this activity, many self-experiments have proved invaluable to the medical community and to the patients we are seeking to help. Therefore, rather than scorn such intrepid colleagues in their search for truth, I am inclined to salute them.”
Trust in medical science and in vaccines in the United States is low. Only 50 percent of Americans have said they would take a COVID-19 vaccine if it were developed. Self-experimentation has long been a way of reassuring the public, and indeed, Gao told the Associated Press he had offered himself up to instill public confidence in vaccines, especially at a time when social media spreads misinformation seemingly faster than the virus itself. 
Disrupted Habitats Have More Zoonotic Disease Hosts: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DAHRS

hen humans alter the landscape through urbanization or agriculture the wildlife that occupied that space becomes displaced. According to a study published Wednesday (August 5) in Nature, animals that stick around after this disruption have a greater proportion of species that host zoonotic diseases than those in undisturbed areas. 
The researchers use the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database in search of any pattern involving altered land and the presence of animals capable of hosting pathogens that can be harmful to humans, called zoonoses or zoonotic diseases. PREDICTS holds data from across six continents, including information on 376 species known to carry zoonoses and around 6,600 other species that don’t. The authors concluded that zoonotic disease hosts represent a greater proportion of the animals in areas with altered land and higher human activity than in remote, less-affected areas.
“What this means is that animal communities in more human-dominated landscapes end up with a higher proportion of disease-carrying species, both in terms of species richness and in the total number of individuals,” co-lead author David Redding, an ecologist at University College London’s Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research, tells UPI.
See: “Predicting Future Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks”
The Guardian reports that, according to the authors, many animals able to thrive in human-occupied areas, such as rodents, bats, and pigeons, are typically small and highly mobile, and have the capacity to reproduce quickly and in large numbers. This rapid reproduction method, favoring quantity over quality, can come at the expense of the animal’s immune system, making them more susceptible to zoonoses.
The study did not quantify the dangers of the relationship between habitat disturbance and zoonotic disease hosts, but there is concern it could have ramifications for human health. For instance, there is evidence SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and made its way into humans, gripping the entire globe in lockdowns, distancing, and economic declines.
“The COVID-19 pandemic triggered by a coronavirus of animal origin has awakened the world to the threat that zoonotic diseases pose to humans,” Richard Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College in New York, comment in Nature. “With this recognition has come a widespread misperception that wild nature is the greatest source of zoonotic disease.”
See: “Which Species Transmit COVID-19 to Humans? We’re Still Not Sure.”
The Guardian reports that humans have altered the landscape of more than half of the habitable land on the planet. Although the rate of population growth is declining, the United Nations predicts that the number of humans will balloon to 9.7 billion by the year 2050, requiring more land use to house and feed everyone.
“Our findings provide a context for thinking about how to manage land use changes more sustainably, in ways that take into account potential risks not only to biodiversity, but also to human health,” Redding explains in a statement. 
DNA Could Thwart Trade of the World’s Most Trafficked Mammal/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

rowing to more than 1.5 meters and weighing in at up to 75 pounds, pangolins aren’t meager creatures. They are solitary, insect-eating mammals that come in a range of sizes, yet all are wrapped in a distinctive armor of sharp, brownish scales. Sometimes referred to as “scaly anteaters” due to their diet and appearance, pangolins have recently attracted global attention for their potential role in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The source of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, remains unclear, but scientists suspect the coronavirus originated in bats and passed to people via an intermediate host. That intermediate host may have been the pangolin, some studies suggest.
The possible role of pangolins in the new coronavirus outbreak has recently piqued the interest of scientists around the world. But many researchers have been studying pangolins for years, for another reason: the scaly creatures are the most trafficked mammals in the world. 
Pangolins are found in Africa and Asia. They are hunted for their pinecone-like scales, which are used in many traditional medicines, and for their meat, which is eaten as a delicacy in parts of Asia and sold at bushmeat markets in Africa—a trade that has threatened the animals’ existence. Of the eight pangolin species that exist, three are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered, and the rest are categorized as either endangered or vulnerable.

Despite a ban placed on the international trade of pangolins in 2017 at the United Nation’s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), illegal trade networks continue to thrive. In addition, as Asian pangolin numbers dwindled from overhunting, the trafficking networks extended to Africa. “The scale [of the trade] has become much more extensive, much more long distance, compared to 20 years ago,” says Shu-Jin Luo, a conservation biologist at the Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences in China.
To trace the trafficking networks, Philippe Gaubert, at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Toulouse, France, is leading PANGO-GO (Pangolins going extinct), a five-year project that aims to apply genomics to help identify and track the origins of illegally traded pangolins. “We are trying to design tools that can be used by institutions, scientists, and NGOs” to help trace and mitigate the trade, Gaubert says. These DNA-based tools, he explains, should help answer three key questions about pangolin scales and body parts seized by authorities: the number of animals that contributed to the seized materials, which species are present, and where they come from. 
See “Tracking Pangolin Traffic Networks”
To develop such a toolkit, Gaubert and his colleagues are studying samples from two types of sources: bushmeat markets in Africa—where the scientists gather samples and interview sellers about the source of their supplies—and collections of specimens at natural history museums. According to Gaubert, gathering live samples is difficult because the pangolin’s solitary nature makes the animals difficult to find in the wild. On top of that, many countries restrict the exportation of samples, even for research purposes. 
In Africa, Gaubert’s team is currently focused on the white-bellied pangolin, a small, tree-dwelling species that’s listed as endangered by the IUCN. In 2016, Gaubert and his colleagues identified unique genetic signatures using mitochondrial DNA for six lineages of white-bellied pangolins from six different regions in Africa. Tapping this reference database, Huarong Zhang, a conservation geneticist at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong, and colleagues found that scales from the white-bellied pangolin, which made up more than 80 percent of 30 samples seized in Hong Kong, could be traced back to all six regions in Africa.

“We were surprised because the shipments mostly come from Nigeria or Cameroon,” Zhang says. “From our data, it looks like it’s from a wider range of areas, so that suggests that poaching is quite widespread.” While the genetic markers the team used to trace the origins of the pangolins were reliable, Zhang notes that one of the limitations of currently available tools is that they are only able to identify the broad region where the animals are from. To pinpoint the source at a country- or population-level, higher-resolution markers are likely necessary, he says. 
Gaubert’s team is working on tools that use identifying markers that are more specific. For a study published this May in Molecular Biology Reports, his group genotyped 37 samples from a market in the coastal city of Douala, Cameroon, and identified 20 short, distinct sequences of DNA known as microsatellite loci. The researchers then used the markers to identify individual white-bellied pangolins and assess the potential geographic origin of the samples. According to the team’s preliminary analysis, the samples came from several different populations within the Ebo forest, which lies just outside of Douala. 
The team is also working on developing genomic tools based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The researchers eventually want to compare the efficiency and the cost of these different approaches, Gaubert says, noting that this tradeoff will be important for choosing the best tool for a given situation, considering factors such as budget and the number of samples being assessed. 
In the African countries where Gaubert’s team conducts research, the illegal pangolin trade rages on. There have been some signs of its slowing due to COVID-19, especially as global lockdowns keep poachers at home and as pangolins’ link to the coronavirus stoke fears that consuming the animals may be harmful. But that slowdown probably won’t be long-lived; the trade is slowly picking back up, Gaubert says. His team recently launched a project in Ivory Coast, Benin, and Cameroon to screen pangolins sold at bushmeat markets for coronavirus and to survey how COVID-19 has changed consumers’ views of pangolins.  
Regardless of public opinion on the animals, determining whether pangolins were an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 requires more research. “More studies should be done not only on pangolins but also other illegally-traded [animals],” Luo says. Regardless of which animal passed the coronavirus to humans, the potential for such transmission is one important reason to stop all wildlife poaching and trade, she explains. “Moving wildlife from their natural habitat and increasing the human-to-wildlife contact just provides millions of chances for [such viruses] to emerge.”

overed in distinctive armor of sharp, pinecone-like scales, pangolins look like reptiles, but they are mammals. Hunters track, kill, and sell the mammals for their scales, which are used in traditional medicines, and for their meat, sometimes served as a delicacy in Asia. As a result, pangolins are the most trafficked mammals in the world. All eight species are labeled critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

t is strangely quiet at the National Crops Resources Research Institute in Namulonge, Uganda. Seventy percent of its 400 staff members have not reported for work since the country instituted a lockdown in March due to a partial furlough and government policies brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We have to work harder to implement our work plans to minimize the disruption of COVID-19 while adhering to the Ministry of Health guidelines and standard operating procedures,” says Godfrey Asea, NaCRRI’s director. The limited staffing has affected harvesting and planting activities, especially for cereals and pulses (beans, lentils, and other seeds that grow in pods).
Although Uganda’s lockdown measures have been among the strictest in Africa, NaCRRI is far from alone. Other agricultural research institutes in Africa are also finding their work curtailed by the pandemic, with potential near-term consequences for farmers in the region.
Research slows down
As one of Uganda’s 16 agricultural research institutes under the National Agricultural Research Organisation, NaCCRI specializes in developing legumes, maize, rice, horticultural crops, and oil palm varieties adapted to the country’s climate, as well as pesticides and herbicides. It also offers quality control testing of consumer products related to agriculture. During the pandemic, it has suspended some research activities, such as stakeholder surveys, and its trainings and tours.
Planting season begins in March in Uganda, and some of the institute’s planned field experiments have either started late or aren’t being monitored as closely as usual due to disrupted working hours and reduced labor, says Asea.
To stop COVID-19’s spread, Uganda initially banned both private and public transport, so organizations had to provide means of travel for their essential workers. Although those restrictions have eased, many organizatons, including NaCCRI, are still providing transportation for staff members. A nightly curfew from 7:00 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. continues. “Moving staff to and from work is now expensive, while curfew restrictions have forced staff to work fewer hours,” says Asea. Sixteen of its graduate students have been forced to stop their research altogether, he adds; only the seven students who live at the institute have been able to continue. According to Asea, the changes “might disrupt timelines for near-release technologies such as new crop varieties for cassava, maize, and rice.”
Even as NaCCRI continues to offer limited quality control services for consumer products such as packed flour, milk, and soil, this work faces challenges, says Asea. In addition to the limitations posed by staffing shortages, “the lockdown on business has made it hard to access laboratory consumables. Reagents are getting depleted with no foreseeable opportunity to restock.” 
On a positive note, he says, “the extra desk time created by the pandemic has also enabled scientists to engage more in scientific writing of journal articles and proposals.” And some laboratory work has continued. For instance, the nutrition and bioanalytical lab has maintained experiments on samples that were already collected in the field before the shutdown that are aimed at developing new crop strains including cassava, sweet potato, and sorghum, and food products such as maize flour, rice, and beans. 
Scientists cut off from farms
In neighboring Tanzania, COVID-19 came during the rainy season. The resulting lockdown imposed by the government left researchers at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), a nonprofit based in the capital city of Dar es Salaam, counting their losses.
“Unfortunately, the rain did not wait for COVID-19, so we missed critical data that we were supposed to collect on our experiments,” says Victor Manyong, IITA director for Eastern Africa and agribusiness head for Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to overseeing local farmers, IITA maintains nine of its own research fields stationed across the country. The organization develops crops to improve yields, processes agriculture products to increase shelf life, and finds novel solutions to pests and diseases. But this year, “we could not go to the rural areas to see the farmers who are growing the crops,” which include cassava, maize, soya bean, cowpea, yam, banana, and plantain, he says. “Neither could we meet with the consumers in the urban areas to know exactly what was happening with agricultural sales.”

IITA
Due to Tanzania’s lockdown and closure of universities, more than two dozen students from local universities who planned to come to IITA for hands-on experience could not travel to rural areas of the country to conduct their research, says Manyong. The students are now expected in September. Nine of the students who’d planned to visit IITA this spring wanted to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment to ward off a toxic fungus that affects maize. They missed the window for applying it to this year’s crop.
IITA had also planned to conduct training in aquaculture in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo, but the pandemic has stopped or delayed delivery of the cages it needed and of a huge quantity of imported fish feed, which was expired by the time it arrived. All told, Manyong says, it’s too soon to know the value of all that IITA has lost to the pandemic, but he expects it will be in the millions of dollars. 
Another researcher affected by the confluence of the pandemic and growing season is Oluwaseyi Shorinola, a crop scientist based at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi, Kenya, who has been working to increase the protein content in wheat varieties grown in Kenya and Ethiopia. His goal, he says, is to enable East African nations to grow more high-quality wheat and reduce their dependence on imported grain.
Working in the laboratory during the lockdown, he managed to finish crossing the best lines of these local grains to optimize them for grain size, protein content, and disease resistance. But pandemic restrictions have contributed to delays in testing his improved lines in the field during the main growing season, pushing that fieldwork to early next year, he says. That will mean he’ll need to apply for an extension to the fellowship from The Royal Society FLAIR that’s supporting the work, he adds.
Ansori Maré, a plant scientist at the University of the Free State in South Africa, is another researcher encountering delays with her wheat-breeding experiments. She has been working to develop new disease-resistant varieties, but due to South Africa’s lockdown, her laboratory and greenhouse work has completely stopped. With no crossed seeds to test, “planting the next season will be later this year, or we will lose a complete season and data collection,” she says. Such delays, she notes, also affect the students in the plant sciences department negatively, slowing the research projects needed to complete their postgraduate studies. 
Since June 1, researchers at Maré’s university now have access to laboratories and the greenhouses again, although under strict rules and regulations aimed at minimizing infection risk. “At this stage, no unreplaceable losses were experienced, except time,” Maré says.
Difficulties collecting animal data 
Chinyere Ekine, a statistical geneticist at ILRI in Nairobi, is working to improve milk yields in Africa using genetics and crossbreeding of cattle. “To do genetic improvements, we would need to measure traits over time, and keep a pedigree of the animals to know who the sire and dam are. Then you can crunch the numbers and pick out the best sire and dam with an average higher breeding value for the traits of interest so the next generation will be better than their parents’ previous generation on average,” she explains.
To that end, ILRI hires workers known as enumerators to collect data on traits from smallholder farmers in rural Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. They also encourage smallholder farmers to learn the importance of consistently collecting their own data for making informed decisions in the future such as which animals to keep or sell, and for determining the value of a farmer’s herd in order to help secure loans. Ekine’s team uses genetic information from animal hair that the enumerators collect along with other data to identify the best bulls for use in breeding via artificial insemination.
According to Ekine, enumerators used to reach the farmers once a month, but when COVID-19 struck in mid-March, people were not allowed to go out to rural communities. In addition to the official lockdown, there were fears that the virus could be transmitted from humans to farm animals, and people could not risk losing their livelihoods. The flow of data from the enumerators has significantly slowed as a result, she says.
“You need to collect data on milk, on growth, in a sequence. You need to follow the animal,” Ekine explains. “When you have missed this data, it’s an analysis lost.” To keep going, Ekine’s team gave farmers cell phone credit to help collect data on their phones, an additional cost that had not been part of the project initially and was not as effective as the enumerators’ data collection, she says. The challenges mean it will take longer to produce improvements in cattle, and smallholders will have less-robust information to use for breeding decisions. “What you cannot measure, you cannot improve,” says Ekine. 
Shorinola worries that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural research could ultimately extend beyond the disruptions he and others have experienced. “Although this has not happened yet, we anticipate that funders might want to divert their resources to new COVID-19 priorities, neglecting important agriculture research,” he says. 
He adds that while developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is very important, problems that affect food security such as locusts and a fungus known as wheat rust have not gone away during the pandemic. To the contrary, he says, “lockdown has exposed the vulnerability of our agriculture systems.”
MeTooSTEM Leader Admits to Faking Twitter Account/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BOMBUSCREATIVE

ethAnn McLaughlin, the controversial founder of the advocacy group MeTooSTEM, has confirmed that she fabricated an entire persona whom she used for years to communicate through Twitter. 
In an apology issued through her lawyers to The New York Times, McLaughlin admitted to “full responsibility for my involvement in creating the @sciencing_bi Twitter account. My actions are inexcusable. I apologize without reservation to all the people I hurt.” She added that she will be stepping away from leadership of MeTooSTEM, “to ensure that it isn’t unfairly criticized for my actions,” and that she will be seeking mental health counseling.
The anonymous account, @Sciencing_Bi, first began tweeting in 2016, and over the years claimed to be a queer indigenous woman, a survivor of sexual harassment, and an anthropologist affiliated with Arizona State University (ASU). Through her seemingly candid stories about her own experiences, @Sciencing_Bi built up a loyal following, including McLaughlin, who frequently acted as a go-between to help preserve @Sciencing_Bi’s anonymity.
But after McLaughlin announced @Sciencing_Bi’s death from COVID-19 several days ago, people began trying to identify her, and her story began to fall apart. Scientists who had considered @Sciencing_Bi an online friend turned from mourning her death to accusing McLaughlin of inventing her outright. “Creating a fake pseudonymous account and pretending various marginalized identities is wrong. It’s evil,” tweeted Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine who had been friendly with @Sciencing_Bi.
@Sciencing_Bi had earlier claimed to be one of several women harassed by former Harvard University archaeologist Gary Urton, Science reports, and frequently used Twitter to interact with other survivors. When reports about him began to surface in the press, an anonymous complainant against Urton tells Buzzfeed News, @Sciencing_Bi “claimed she also had a title IX at Harvard against Urton and contacted me with a sob story about how much she suffered, while at the same time encouraging me to reach out to BethAnn.” Leveraging a traumatic event to gain clout among survivors, the complainant added, “is beyond messed up.”
In April, @Sciencing_Bi shared that she had been hospitalized for COVID-19, and she laid the blame at the feet of her supposed employer. “ASU kept teachers, staff and students on campus until April. That’s well after we knew this was a killer disease. Many got covid. Including me,” she shared in a May 23 tweet. She continued to tweet from her sickbed, Heavy reports, sharing details about salary cuts ASU had levied during her illness.
Despite a period of recovery following the hospitalization, McLaughlin posted news of her death last Friday (July 31) from complications related to COVID-19. Her followers reacted with stunned disbelief that quickly morphed into anger directed at ASU for forcing teachers to work in unsafe conditions. The incident comes at a time when schools worldwide are considering opening for in-person classes in the fall, and when indigenous communities in the US are being disproportionately affected by the virus.
See “Study: Test College Students for Coronavirus Every Two Days”
It was during a subsequent memorial, held over Zoom by McLaughlin, that @Sciencing_Bi story began to come apart, according to Science. Only a handful of people attended the service, and it quickly became clear that only McLaughlin claimed to have ever met the woman in person. A reverse image search of @Sciencing_Bi’s posts showed that many images were stock photos, and McLaughlin later admitted that the only image purporting to show a small part of @Science_Bi’s face in profile was actually a picture of McLaughlin’s daughter, Gizmodo reports. 
As more people began reaching out to ASU for accountability, the university could not identify any faculty members who had died. In a widely reported email statement released early this week, ASU spokesperson Gerardo Gonzales called the incident a likely hoax. “We looked into this over the weekend and were unable to verify any connection with the university. We were in touch with several deans and faculty members and no one was able to identify the account or who might be behind it,” Gonzales says. In addition, he shared that ASU had transitioned to remote learning as early as March and had not carried out any salary cuts during the pandemic.
Twitter suspended both the @Sciencing_Bi account and McLaughlin’s own account, @McLNeuro, by early Monday morning, telling Buzzfeed, “we’re aware of this activity and have suspended these accounts for violating our spam and platform manipulation policies.”
McLaughlin had initially denied running the @Sciencing_Bi account. In response to an email from a reporter at The Arizona Republic asking after the identity of @Sciencing_Bi, Mclaughlin responded, “To the extent that I have people engage with me on Twitter using accounts not associated with their names, I try to do that in good faith assuming they are authentic.” Yet she had previously tweeted about sharing a bed with @Sciencing_Bi. Responding to similar questions sent by email from Buzzfeed, McLaughlin simply replied, “I’m not going to dox anyone,” referring to the practice of publishing identifying information on the internet.
McLaughlin, a neuroscientist, has become a polarizing figure in academia. She established the sexual assault advocacy group MeTooSTEM in 2018, and left her position at Vanderbilt University the following year after being denied tenure (despite a petition pushed by @Sciencing_Bi urging her promotion). However, fellow members of the organization’s leadership team began to resign over what they claimed was bullying behavior towards women of color and survivors of sexual assault, Buzzfeed reported in February. 
People who interacted with @Sciencing_Bi on Twitter or through private messages are now reacting with anger, horrified by what they say is blatant racism: a white woman impersonating a queer member of the Hopi tribe and then killing her off. Anna Fore Waymack, a PhD candidate at Cornell University, says her actions amount to “digital redface,” Inside Higher Ed reports.
“This faking being Native has a long history of being tied to the actual theft of resources and land,” Kim TallBear, a professor in native studies at the University of Alberta in Canada, tells BuzzFeed. “The fact that this woman thought she could get away with this tells you how little she understands about the actual state of affairs for Native people in the United States.”
@Science_Bi had once solicited Venmo donations using McLaughlin’s personal account, supposedly in order to protect her anonymity, according to Heavy, while Gizomodo reports that she also claimed to have received support from MeTooSTEM, although whether that support was financial remains unknown.
Some observers worry about what McLaughlin’s actions will mean for MeTooSTEM and the broader practice of women sharing their experiences anonymously through social media moving forward. “The need to end rape culture everywhere, including in STEM, remains, and the struggle to end sexual violence and gendered discrimination will continue,” Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of New Hampshire, tells Inside Higher Ed. “BethAnn didn’t start that movement, and no single person owns it.” 
Does the Common Cold Protect You from COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FILO
I
n labs all over the world lately, scientists working on COVID-19 have stumbled on an intriguing sort of finding again and again. They’ve found that blood samples from healthy people who were never exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contain reactive immune cells and targeted antibodies that could, perhaps, help stave off COVID-19. 
These people may—it is still just a hypothesis—possess some degree of pre-existing immunity. If correct, it’s even possible that this immunity has saved thousands from the worst manifestations of this terrible disease.
Some of the first hints of pre-existing immunity came via T cells, the white blood cells that destroy infected cells in the body or help other parts of the immune system target an invading pathogen. In one study originally published as a preprint on medRxiv April 22, a group of scientists in Germany reported an intriguing result. 
Out of 68 healthy donors who had been tested for prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and who were found to be negative, 24 of them had a small number of T cells in their blood that reacted when exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein—a complex structure protruding from the virus’s exterior surface. The study, which was later published in Nature July 29, explains that the cells in question produced proteins on their surfaces, an indication of an immune response. 
If that is indeed what’s going on here, one possible explanation would be that the healthy donors had been infected by another coronavirus relatively recently, perhaps one that causes a common cold, says coauthor Andreas Thiel, an immunologist at the Charité hospital, part of Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Besides more serious diseases such as COVID-19 and SARS, human coronaviruses have been known for decades to cause what are usually much milder infections. The specific viruses that cause these illnesses are found all around the world.
Immunity to common cold viruses is not thought to be very long-lasting for people, regardless of age, so it is debatable how durable a protective effect would be.
“Although these viruses are not very similar [to SARS-CoV-2], the low degree of similarity is of course sufficient that the immune system, at least partly, is cross-reacting, which is a very normal thing,” he says.
An earlier study in Nature on July 15 from Singapore reported that 23 patients who had caught the original SARS virus 17 years ago and a further 37 individuals who had never been found to have had SARS or COVID-19 possessed CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ killer T cells that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.
Lead author Nina Le Bert, an immunologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, says that her paper chimes with Thiel’s work and a few other studies that have also found SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in blood from people who never had COVID-19, or who were sampled before the pandemic.
A study in Science today (August 4) also found SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in pre-pandemic blood samples from 25 healthy individuals. In this case, the authors also mapped 142 specific points on the SARS-CoV-2 virus called epitopes associated with this activity. 
This allowed them to show, in subsequent experiments, that the T cells also reacted when exposed to epitopes on common cold coronaviruses that were similar to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, supporting the idea that previous exposure to these common viruses might leave our immune systems primed to respond to the novel coronavirus. 
Determining whether the T cell activity really is protective against COVID-19 is tricky, Le Bert says. “You would need to study people before and after getting infected.”
See “SARS-CoV-2-Reactive T Cells Found in Patients with Severe COVID-19”
Le Bert adds that having some degree of immunity also does not mean that people definitely won’t get infected in the first place. They may still experience mild symptoms, for example, as their immune system fends off the virus. 
Thiel points out that reactive T cells could even produce the opposite result—a detrimental immune response that ultimately harms the patient, for example, when someone experiences excessive inflammation or an inability to clear the virus. “Maybe particularly in the old people, having such cross-reactive T cells could be bad,” he suggests.
Pre-existing immunity might not be limited to T cells. A preprint published on medRxiv July 23 reports that SARS-CoV-2–reactive antibodies were found in blood samples taken from people in the UK between 2018 and early 2020, before COVID-19 became widespread in the country. 
Not only did the authors find that 15 out of 262 people who never had COVID-19 have IgG antibodies reactive with certain SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but further tests showed that these antibodies had a neutralizing effect on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which suggests that they might be able to restrict infection by the virus.
One of the most striking findings was that these antibodies were far more prevalent in children between the ages of 1 and 16 years old. In fact, 60 percent of children had neutralizing IgG antibodies—an order of magnitude greater than the proportion of adults who were found to have the same antibodies. Coauthor Rupert Beale, an immunologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, remarked on Twitter that this particular result was completely unexpected—“a kind of bombshell,” as he put it.
In their preprint, the authors write that kids are generally more frequently exposed to other coronaviruses, such as those that cause common colds. This could explain the prevalence of those IgG antibodies in their blood.
It is notable that, while Beale’s team detected IgG neutralizing antibodies in some of their subjects, none of the healthy donors in the study by Thiel and his colleagues were found to have reactive IgG antibodies, though they did have reactive T cells.
The presence of neutralizing antibodies does not guarantee that these children are immune to COVID-19 but it does offer one possible explanation as to why children, generally speaking, experience milder symptoms when they catch the disease.
The findings are “really interesting,” says Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester in the UK, via email. She notes that, in the study, a different type of antibody that is protective against SARS-CoV-2, IgA, was not detected in the healthy individuals unexposed to the new coronavirus. That might mean any pre-existing immunity is limited. The other big caveat is that immunity to common cold viruses is not thought to be very long-lasting for people, regardless of age, so it is debatable how durable a protective effect would be, she adds.
In Le Bert’s study, patients appeared to have retained reactive T cells for nearly two decades. She and her colleagues write in their report that this has potentially significant implications: that immunity acquired through, say, a vaccine could last for many months or years.
Study: Test College Students for Coronavirus Every Two Days/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FATCAMERA
A
s colleges prepare to open—or not open—their campuses to students for the upcoming school year, scientists have come up with a scenario they say could limit the spread of the coronavirus. Testing every student every two days and quickly isolating those with positive results should avoid widespread SARS-CoV-2 infections on college campuses, whereas only testing students with symptoms would not, according to a modeling study published Friday (July 31) in JAMA Network Open.
The researchers used an initial scenario with 5,000 students on campus, 10 of whom were carrying the coronavirus. They varied how many people each student infects, the frequency of testing, and the sensitivity of the tests used—that is, how often they correctly identify a person as infected.
If students were tested each day with a test with a sensitivity of 70 percent, 162 would become infected over the course of an 80-day semester, the model projected; testing every two days would result in 243 new infections. In contrast, weekly testing would result in 1,840 new infections. That sensitivity is on the low end for tests, but the authors assume such tests would be cheaper than higher-quality versions.
Study coauthor A. David Paltiel tells The Washington Post that the frequency of testing is more important than its accuracy, because testing repeatedly would eventually identify positive cases. He also notes that deciding not to reopen campuses, and instead have students stay home for the semester, is not without risk. “The problem doesn’t go away simply because you don’t reopen campus,” he says. 
In remarks to UPI, Paltiel recognizes that high-frequency testing of all students will be challenging to implement. “This sets a high bar—logistically, financially and behaviorally—that may be beyond the capacity of many universities, and everything that could go wrong has to go right to avert an outbreak,” he tells the wire service. “However, any school that cannot meet these minimum screening standards or maintain uncompromising control over good prevention practices has to ask itself if it has any business reopening.”
See “Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19”
The modeling did not uncover any scenarios in which waiting to act until students displayed symptoms would contain the virus, and Paltiel tells CNN that doing so would be “like a fire department that only responds to calls once they have verifiable evidence that the house has already burned to the ground.”
In a commentary accompanying the study, other researchers suggest that frequent testing may not be necessary if students test negative before being allowed back on campus and if multiple precautions are taken to stop the virus from getting onto campus or spreading once there, such as mask wearing and social distancing and erecting physical barriers. They estimate that with such measures and testing every four weeks, their college, Vassar, would only see 79 student infections out of 2,500 people over the course of a semester. “Thus, before diverting resources from other interventions to testing every 2 days, we should consider a broader perspective,” they write. “The best-prepared campuses will implement a set of interlocking strategies that together aim, first, to reduce the influx of COVID-19 from outside and, second, to limit its spread once on campus.”
Paltiel tells Inside Higher Education, “I’m a little bit distressed by how confident Vassar is to weed out infection by re-entry and to keep the students inside that walled garden and to regulate that behavior. As someone with an engineering background, I think often about the fact that we build bridges not to withstand the weight we expect but to withstand the weight several times we expect.”
Most Members of Federal Fetal Tissue Ethics Panel Oppose Abortion/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BLACKHOLY
Update (August 19): The panel has rejected 13 of the 14 proposals it has considered thus far, The Washington Post reports.
M
ore than a year after the Department of Health and Human Services announced the creation of the National Institutes of Health Human Fetal Tissue Research Ethics Advisory Board, members of the committee convened for the first time on Friday (July 31) to oversee the ethics of using fetal tissue in federally funded research. Of the 15 committee members, appointed by President Donald Trump, 10 have a history of activism against abortion or fetal tissue use. As Buzzfeed News reports, some researchers have voiced concerns that the panel could impair future research on HIV, diabetes, COVID-19 vaccines, and more.
The board’s purpose is to review research grant proposals that study human fetal tissue (HFT) and advise that they receive funding only if no adequate alternatives exist and that the acquisition and disposal of the material meet ethical guidelines. Their recommendations will be passed along to Alex Azar, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
HFT is used to study many diseases, including HIV, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and others. While the availability of HFT in biomedical research has waxed and waned over the years, the Trump administration announced last summer that there would be new restrictions on obtaining biological material from abortions.
The committee chair is Paige Comstock Cunningham, an attorney with a doctorate in educational studies, Science reports. Cunningham was the president of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion organization, and has testified before Congress against research using fetal tissues.
Nine other members of the board have also made public anti-abortion or anti-contraceptive stances in the form of op-eds, Congressional testimonies, and drafting or promoting legislation. These include four researchers, two pediatricians, an OB-GYN, an internist, and a professor of moral philosophy, according to Science. Three of them are connected professionally to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is “an organization dedicated to electing candidates and pursuing policies that will reduce and ultimately end abortion,” according to its website.
Four members of the board, a neonatologist and three researchers, have not opined publicly on the topic of fetal tissue research. 
See “Scientists Grapple with US Restrictions on Fetal Tissue Research”
The final appointee is Lawrence Goldstein, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who uses fetal cells in Alzheimer’s research and has publicly opposed undue restrictions on their use.
“The fetal tissue that we’re talking about—if we don’t use it for research, it will be discarded,” Goldstein told The Scientist earlier this year. “That’s the choice. Discard the fetal tissue in the trash, or use it for valuable research.”
The agenda for the first meeting involved 40 minutes of introductions and establishing procedures, 20 minutes of public comments, and five hours of closed-door discussions.
The long wait between the advisory board’s announcement and its actual creation has resulted in grant proposals growing stagnant, as the committee review became a requirement back on September 25, 2019. This has already prevented some studies from occurring, Buzzfeed News reports.

Children Often Carry More Coronavirus than Adults Do: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LAKSHMIPRASAD S
A
new study is challenging the idea that younger children are somehow less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children under the age of five have been found to carry just as much, if not more, coronavirus in their noses and throats than older kids or adults.
The results, published Thursday (July 30) in JAMA Pediatrics, tested 145 people for evidence of the virus’s RNA. After breaking their participants down into three age categories—younger children, older children, and adults—researchers found that the youngest group harbored between 10 times and 100 times more virus than the other two. While the results cannot speak to children’s ability to transmit the disease to others, they come at a time when schools nationwide weighing the risks of opening again in the fall.
“The school situation is so complicated—there are many nuances beyond just the scientific one,” Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital and the lead author on the study, tells The New York Times. “But one takeaway from this is that we can’t assume that just because kids aren’t getting sick, or very sick, that they don’t have the virus.”
Heald-Sargent first became interested in the question of how COVID-19 affects children after receiving some strange test results—children’s swab samples were indicating a higher load of virus than adults, a counterintuitive observation given that kids appear far less likely to develop symptoms. To determine the viral load in patients, doctors will take a standard nasopharyngeal swab and analyze it using a method called quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). During each cycle of the qPCR, the initially small amount of viral genetic material doubles, leading to an exponential increase. If there is more genetic material on the swab at the start, fewer cycles are needed to hit what is called a cycle threshold, or CT.
Samples collected from younger children generally had lower CTs, meaning they had more virus present in their samples from the beginning. Heald-Sargent decided to look back over the several weeks, between late March and late April, to see how common this result was. Originally, she tells the Times, “it wasn’t even something we had set out to look for.”
Alongside her colleagues, Heald-Sargent analyzed samples taken from 145 people who had either visited drive-through testing sites in Chicago or visited local hospitals for any reason. Because people with severe infections would be expected to have high viral loads, the team included only individuals with either mild or moderate symptoms. In addition, they excluded people with asymptomatic infections, those who couldn’t pinpoint when their symptoms had started, and people who had experienced symptoms for more than a week before testing.
After dividing the participants into the three age groups—specifically, children under the age of five, children between five and 17, and adults aged 18 to 65—the scientists saw that the low CT results were consistent in younger patients, while the CTs of older children and adults were more comparable to each other. “It definitely shows that kids do have levels of virus similar to and maybe even higher than adults,” Heald-Sargent tells the Times. 
The results are in line with similar small studies from other countries. In Germany, 47 children between one and 11 were found to have viral loads as high as those in adults. Among 438 children in France, CT scores were similar between asymptomatic children and those with obvious symptoms, supporting the idea that children can harbor high amounts of the virus without becoming visibly ill.
Alpana Waghmare, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children’s, says the results of this latest study are a welcome addition. “The data in pediatrics has not been as robust as adults with Covid-19 so it’s really nice to have additional virologic data in pediatric patients,” she tells CNN. “It’s not surprising to find higher viral loads in children. I think the question of what that exactly means for transmission is still not clear.”  
Researchers in South Korea recently published a study looking at disease transmission in children and young adults, finding that those between 10 and 19 years old transmitted the disease just as frequently as adults, although children under nine were found to transmit COVID-19 less frequently, CNN reports.
Scientists have also been turning to other diseases to assess how likely children are to transmit the coronavirus, but evidence is still lacking. Rick Malley, a senior physician in pediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital, tells NBC News, “we don’t have the evidence that children will play the same role with this virus as they do, say, with the flu virus, where it’s pretty clear that kids with flu are main drivers of spread.”
Heald-Sargent says it’s likely the same could be true with COVID-19. “Any grade-school teacher or pediatrician will tell you, [young children] are pretty effective little vectors of virus transmission, because we get sick a lot in the winter from these kids,” she says to CNN. “I think looking at other viruses that are similar . . . it would seem more likely that kids will be transmitting” COVID-19 as well, she says, adding that further research will be needed to confirm it. 
How Our Exhalations Help Spread Pathogens Such as SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PABST_ELL
L
ydia Bourouiba first began thinking about how pathogens travel during the global SARS outbreak that began in November 2002. SARS, a close viral cousin of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current COVID-19 pandemic, leapt from person to person via contaminated surfaces, but even then there was discussion among epidemiologists that airborne transmission may be an understudied mechanism contributing to the spread of the virus. As a physical mathematician with an interest in fluid dynamics and public health, Bourouiba knew that pathogens exist in fluids—in the body, in water, or in air—and she also knew a bit about how fluids move through the world. Despite what she calls the “many gaps in our understanding” of how diseases pass from person to person, these two points made her curious enough to pivot from a career in mathematics and physics to one in epidemiology.
Now, as director of the fluid dynamics of disease transmission laboratory at MIT, Bourouiba and her colleagues merge fluid dynamics and epidemiology to study the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens that dwell in respiratory fluids. With more than 17 million COVID-19 cases and 667,000 deaths worldwide to date, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens spread is critical. Scientists around the world recently petitioned agencies such as the World Health Organization to acknowledge airborne transmission in the current pandemic, prompting the agency to admit that, at least indoors, it “cannot be ruled out.”
Lydia Bourouiba
LILLIE PAQUETTE, MIT SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
In her lab, Bourouiba uses a combination of theoretical approaches and experimental tools, such as flow visualization, high-speed imaging, and microscopy, to build a more holistic view of the air we exhale as dynamic and complex “clouds” of droplets that can travel more than 20 feet from where we’re standing. Her findings break away from the traditional study of airborne emissions as a dichotomy between large droplets and small aerosols. Instead, she says, our coughs and sneezes project “a continuum of droplet sizes,” a fact that has important implications for modeling and assessing disease transmission.
The Scientist spoke with Bourouiba about the importance of studying pathogens transmitted through the air and how her work might inform our public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Scientist: How does the physics of coughs and sneezes play into the transmission of diseases such as COVID-19?
Lydia Bourouiba: Right now, we believe [SARS-CoV-2 is] transmitted mostly through the respiratory tract. The infection occurs in the respiratory tract and emissions from the tract are the propulsion mechanism of the virus into the environment and toward others. It’s very important, therefore, to understand not only the distances but also the timescales of exposures. The virus is never emitted in the air on its own. It’s always in the mucosalivary secretion that is emitted from either breathing out, coughing, or sneezing. In all cases, you’re creating a cloud, but the drop-size distribution and the energy of the gas will be different.
TS: What happens with our fluids when we do something like sneeze or cough?
LB: The exhalation is very much like a cloud . . . but it’s a [cloud] with a much higher momentum for coughs and sneezes. It . . . is moving around like you see when you have condensation on top of a pot. And it also contains this payload of droplets, like real clouds outside, [with] swelling and motion and turbulence inside. 
See “Gesundheit”
The difference between different events [e.g., talking, sneezing, coughing] is simply the volumes [of the clouds] that are emitted, the timescales over which they’re emitted, and therefore also the energy or momentum that they have. That momentum is what is driving the contamination range and exposures of others. 
TS: Do you feel that airborne transmission is being properly addressed during the pandemic?
LB: Yes and no. It has been discussed, and the paper that I published in the JAMA in March [outlining the need for better models to track airborne transmission of COVID-19] has also generated a lot of discussion. But I think that there’s still a very fragmented landscape of research and views about the topic that at this point really should be unified but are still not. 
And it’s because the research hasn’t been done consistently. Particularly in terms of pandemics, there’s a lot of different fields looking at these questions, and although cooperation and information transfer should be our goal, there hasn’t always been a dropping of the barriers between areas of research or even awareness of each other. I don’t think we are at the point yet where we’ve seen a unified thrust forward that could bring all this together.
TS: Why is it so hard to study airborne diseases in particular?
LB: A lot of the information is gathered during a time of crisis in a very rudimentary way. Historically, there have been a lot of times where the questions should continue to be the focus after the pandemic to prepare for the next one [but that often doesn’t happen]. It always leaves us in this vulnerable position of being in a reactive mode during a pandemic, which is not ideal to get down to the mechanisms of problems. Research done in a rush is never really going to lead to deep insights.
TS: What can we do to protect ourselves and others from the risks associated with COVID-19?
LB: Wearing a mask, even if they’re not the hybrid respirators, is critical to minimize the range of that emission from one individual and to provide some level of protection to others. But that does not necessarily replace the fact that we need to be careful about how close we are to others, how long we are in that space, how many individuals are in that space, and how the maintenance and protocols of contamination for both the air and surfaces are being deployed. Instead of thinking about one aspect, we really need to think holistically.

IT’s Lydia Bourouiba used a high speed camera to record coughs and sneezes at a rate of up to 2,000 frames per second. While previous work has described exhalations in terms of either large, fast-falling droplets or small, drifting aerosols, the videos reveal that sneezes are dynamic and turbulent clouds containing both air and mucosalivary droplets of many sizes. These coughs and sneezes can travel up to 26 feet, far beyond the 6-foot distancing rule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For years, virologists predicted that coronaviruses would jump from animals to humans, causing new diseases. Unfortunately, those fears have been realized and SARS-CoV-2 now spreads across the globe. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the origins and spread of coronaviruses is taking center stage. In this webinar from The Scientist, coronavirus experts will describe how SARS-CoV-2 came to infect humans. Linda Saif will give a historical overview of SARS spillovers from animals to humans, and Neville Sanjana will describe recent work on a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant that increases human infectivity.

Masks Lower Wearers’ Exposure to Viruses, Experts Propose/-/ABOVE: A face mask might protect the person wearing it as well as others, studies suggest. © ISTOCK.COM, LEGNA69
W
earing a face mask may stave off severe infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or could prevent infection entirely, a growing body of research suggests.
Masks “really are protective of you as an individual,” Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco, tells NPR. That physical barrier—while not impervious to viral penetration—blocks some viral particles from getting into the body, she says. Reducing the amount of exposure could allow the immune system to neutralize the invaders, potentially resulting in a milder infection or no infection at all. She and colleagues present the idea and supporting evidence from animal studies and observational COVID-19 reports in more detail in a paper slated to appear next week in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

This connection between wearing a mask and milder COVID-19 disease is still correlational and has not been shown as causative, Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the work, tells The New York Times. But it “reiterates what we say about masks,” she says. “It’s not just a selfless act.” In other words, masks don’t just protect those around the wearer from exposure.
Gandhi and her colleagues describe past studies that show that the higher the dose of a virus a mouse receives, the more likely that animal is to die. The team also describes an experiment in which researchers sprayed varying levels of flu virus into the noses of human volunteers. The higher dose of the flu in the spray, the more likely the volunteer was to develop an infection and become ill.
See “Could Tolerating Disease Be Better than Fighting It?”
And it appears masks can reduce the dose of the virus that enters the body. Recently, a study in hamsters showed that a barrier made of surgical mask material between animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and healthy hamsters tamped down the spread of the virus. 
“If [the hamsters] were masked they were less likely to get infection, and then even if they got infection they got mild infection,” Gandhi tells Fox Television Stations.
Data from viral outbreaks on cruise ships and poultry plants align with the findings of the hamster study. An analysis of infections of passengers and crew on a cruise ship that departed from Argentina in March showed that after the first reported case of COVID-19, all 217 passengers and crew were given masks, and of the 128 people who eventually contracted the virus, 81 percent were asymptomatic—a much higher proportion than expected. About 40 percent of cases are usually asymptomatic, Gandhi tells The Washington Post. In their paper, Gandhi and colleagues cite several other examples of masks correlating to higher rates of asymptomatic cases, indicating masks are protective not only of others but also the person wearing the mask.
“It’s been a real deficiency in the messaging about masking to say that it only protects the other,” Charles Haas, an environmental engineer and expert in risk assessment at Drexel University who was not involved in the latest work, tells the Times. “From the get go, that never made sense scientifically.”

he reproductive number R describes the average number of individuals that a person infected with a particular pathogen infects. It depends on how that pathogen is transmitted as well as how often people come into contact with each other—factors that could vary depending on a pathogen’s strain and on the time and location of an outbreak. Scientists typically distinguish between R0, the basic reproductive number that describes disease transmission at the very beginning of an outbreak in a fully susceptible population, and Re, the effective reproductive number that describes transmission once measures such as social distancing or vaccination campaigns have been introduced. Re is typically much lower than R0.
THE SCIENTIST STAFF
MODELING AND R, THE REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER
Researchers across the world have developed countless epidemiological models to project the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of different public health policies on the spread of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Most, but not all, models being used today give the two versions of R—R0 and Re—a central role. The basic reproductive number R0 describes the spread of a disease at the beginning of an outbreak, and Re, an “effective” version of the metric, describes spread later on.
Statistical models
Statistical techniques can predict the likely trajectory of an outbreak based on observed data. For example, an early iteration of a model developed by the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which helped inform the White House’s response to the pandemic, works by characterizing the curve of death numbers in Wuhan and a number of European cities, and projecting those curves onto US data.

Relationship with R: Such models don’t typically use R, but are sometimes used to make quick estimates for R. 
Performance: Statistical techniques can be useful for making very short-term predictions, but they do not capture the dynamics of disease transmission or changing contact rates between people due to social distancing measures. Likely for these reasons, early predictions of the IHME model were off. As of early May, IHME has been using a new “hybrid” model that uses both statistical and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) modeling techniques.
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models
SIR models subdivide populations into compartments such as “susceptible,” “infectious,” or “recovered,” and sometimes other compartments such as “exposed but not yet infectious,” “asymptomatic,” or “dead.” Data on cases, hospitalizations, or deaths can inform estimations of the sizes of those compartments, and equations describe the speed at which people move from one compartment to the next.   
VARIOUS © ISTOCK.COM; THE SCIENTIST STAFF
VARIOUS © ISTOCK.COM; THE SCIENTIST STAFF
Relationship with R: SIR models calculate R using several parameters, including the probability of infection, contact rate, and the period over which an individual is infectious. Once calculated, R helps determine how quickly susceptible people become infected, and thus shapes how fast a disease spreads across a population.
Performance: SIR-type models capture the fundamental dynamics of disease transmission and the effects of public health interventions, but they are often criticized for ignoring differences in contact rates across a population. More-refined SIR-type models, however, do account for varying contact rates, and some correctly predicted the fade-out of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan earlier this year.
Agent-based models
Agent-based models simulate individuals—or “agents”—interacting in various social settings and can estimate the spread of disease as these agents come into contact with others. Such simulations are often based on activity surveys, census data, de-identified mobile phone location data, and information from public transportation or airlines.

Relationship with R: Some researchers compute R separately and then plug it into their agent-based models, while others use these models to generate estimates of R and predict how R changes based on different interventions. In both cases, agent-based models typically calculate R per agent, unlike SIR-type models that calculate R over whole populations or demographics.
Performance: Several research groups prefer using agent-based models because they can simulate human behavior more accurately than SIR-type models and can predict how individuals’ decisions, such as staying at home, lead to collective or aggregate behavior, and thereby affect disease spread. However, such models require a lot of detailed data about human movement, and an enormous amount of computing power.

The Search for Immune Responses that Stop COVID-19/-/ABOVE: Antigen presenting cells (APCs) recruit T and B cells during a viral infection
DESIGNED BY BIORENDER IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. AKIKO IWASAKI. ORIGINAL IMAGE CREATED IN BIORENDER AND CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT  https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates/t-5f178d344f5fad00a7792332

hen COVID-19 began spreading like wildfire in the Northeast United States this spring, critical care doctor Nuala Meyer could barely believe what she was seeing.
“The number of patients who were presenting with critical illness all at the same time was staggering,” remembers Meyer, a professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. But it wasn’t just that these patients were really sick—it was that they were sick in a startling variety of ways. Some had cardiac issues. Others had blood clots in their legs. Then there were those who developed pneumonia and related respiratory problems. Organ failure affected some. The list went on and on. 
When Meyer and colleagues profiled the ways in which hospitalized patients’ bodies had tried to combat the virus, they found a variety of different immune responses. T and B cells were highly activated in some but not others, for instance. Their work joins a swath of recent publications aiming to decipher the role of these crucial cells in fending off SARS-CoV-2. To understand how vaccines and long-term immunity function, scientists say, they’ll need to uncover how T and B cells fight this most challenging of infections. 
In pursuit of this goal, Meyer and her colleagues examined immune responses in a sample of 125 patients. Their findings were published in Science July 15.
The fact that antibody levels are falling doesn’t mean we haven’t got a memory response.
—Sheena Cruickshank, University of Manchester
The researchers found that some patients had very unbalanced immune cell activity and that this imbalance could manifest in multiple ways. For instance, some produced lots of CD4+ T cells—helper cells that assist other parts of the immune system to block or destroy the virus—but very few CD8+ T “killer” cells, which destroy infected cells in the body. Meanwhile, some patients generated lots of B cells, which churn out antibodies, but not in concert with the two main types of T cell. Getting these cells to work together is important, explains coauthor Michael Betts, an immunologist at the Penn Institute for Immunology, because it helps fight infection on several fronts at once. Some T cells, for instance, help B cells to produce antibodies—it’s a joint effort. In some patients studied by the group, there was a worrying lack of T and B cells in general. 
Severely ill patients, notably, experienced “the spectrum” of responses, says Betts—from hardly any T and B cell activation to excessive amounts. He says it’s still not clear what drives severe illness in many patients. Scientists also don’t yet know precisely what kind of T and B cell response occurs in patients who have mild or no symptoms.
See “SARS-CoV-2-Reactive T Cells Found in Patients with Severe COVID-19”
“It’s a very nice paper,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. She says that while antibodies have been much talked about, it’s important to recognize that for people to retain immunity to the virus over time, good T and B cell responses are necessary. 
There are indeed signs that people won’t gain long-term immunity through having neutralizing antibodies circulate in their blood for years. Rather, it will likely be provided by those T and B cells. A study published June 18 in Nature Medicine showed how, in a cohort of 74 symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, antibodies waned dramatically in most of these people after just a few months. Those individuals may well be able to produce antibodies quickly again if they get infected, however, thanks to their T and B cells. It’s a bit like having a fire department available to call on—that way, you don’t need the firemen always hanging around on site just in case a blaze breaks out.
Role of T cells in COVID-19 vaccines
“The fact that antibody levels are falling doesn’t mean we haven’t got a memory response,” says Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester in the UK who was not involved in the study.
This is why, when multiple groups working on vaccines announced the results of early phase clinical trials lately, there was excitement over the fact that they reported T and B cell responses in trial participants. 
Among those reporting results was the team at the University of Oxford that has developed a vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus. The adenovirus is modified to harbor the gene that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. 
The group’s results, published July 20 in The Lancet, show that the vaccine did not provoke serious side effects in a sample of around 1,000 healthy adults aged 18–55 and it also produced what appears to be a desirable immune response involving both antibodies and T and B cells. 
Another group at biotech firm Moderna reported results from a Phase 1 trial of its vaccine in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 14. In 45 healthy adults aged 18–55, neutralizing antibodies and T cells were stimulated, including CD8+ killer T cells.
“Those T cell responses reported from the vaccine trials looked pretty impressive,” says Iwasaki.
Scientists are uncovering a string of immunological mysteries associated with the disease.
All vaccines currently in development still need to undergo further tests to show that they are safe in a broader group of people and that they do indeed prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Betts points out that there will be differences between the immune response to a natural infection and the response provoked by a successful vaccine. As of yet, scientists are still not sure what the ideal response in either case looks like. But one thing vaccine researchers will look for, Betts notes, is a T and B cell response that can maintain some degree of immunity over a significant period of time.
“As with other vaccines, it is possible, even likely, that the vaccine won’t prevent you from catching COVID but may greatly reduce severity,” he says in an email.
“Puzzling” immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
It is possible that some people have gained T cell–based immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus from other previous infections. 
On July 15, a study in Nature described evidence of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in 23 patients who had previously contracted the original SARS virus 17 years ago. 
This was based on the fact that those individuals retained long-lasting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that the authors showed produced a protein called interferon-gamma when exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s nucleocapsid (N) protein. This suggests that those people’s T cells were primed to help fend off SARS-CoV-2. 
See “Seeking an Early COVID-19 Drug, Researchers Look to Interferons”
The authors even found SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells in 37 other patients who had no history of SARS, COVID-19, or contact with people who had had those diseases. While it’s difficult to be certain about those individuals’ medical histories, based on the study’s results, cross-reactivity—when the immune system is able to fend off one type of infection thanks to immunity acquired after another—has possibly been at work in people who have experienced mild or no symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the authors speculate. 
The list of things to investigate about COVID-19 doesn’t stop at T and B cells. In fact, scientists are uncovering a string of immunological mysteries associated with the disease. 
Iwasaki says that two key types of antibody seem to be generated in an unusual order after infection. With COVID-19, IgG antibodies are often generated very quickly and then followed by a rise in IgM antibodies—the wrong way round.
“That’s kind of puzzling because that’s not a typical textbook way in which the antibodies are generated,” says Iwasaki. And in some patients, B cells begin reacting as though the person were experiencing an allergic reaction, producing IgE antibodies. This too is, so far, unexplained. 
Betts and Meyer also noticed that some patients in their study produced high volumes of plasmablasts—B cells converted into immature plasma cells that produce antibodies. 
“We normally think of something like Ebola infection being pretty awful,” says Betts. “These plasmablast responses that we see in severe COVID are actually larger than the ones we see in Ebola.”
It’s unusual to see such a strong plasmablast response that lasts for days, confirms Meyer. 
Eventually, answers to the many questions around COVID-19 immunity may emerge. Scientists already know far more than they did just a few months ago. But as Meyer says, “We have a lot of work to do.”
Study: Mask-Wearing Moms with COVID-19 Can Safely Nurse Babies/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SOUTH_AGENCY
T
here are incalculable benefits to prolonged close contact and breastfeeding for a mother and new baby. But that close contact has raised questions about the safety surrounding an infected mother interacting with her newborn. According to a new study published Thursday (July 23) in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 who took the precaution of wearing a surgical mask and washing their hands safely breastfed their babies and did not transmit the virus to them over a two-week period.
The study followed 116 mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of delivery. All of the newborns were swabbed and tested for the virus 24 hours after birth, and most were tested two more times, at five to seven days and at two weeks, with a telemedicine checkup at one month. All of the tests came back negative, and none of the babies were symptomatic. The babies who did not undergo the additional testing remained asymptomatic during the observation period. 
“We hope our study will provide some reassurance to new mothers that the risk of them passing COVID-19 to their babies is very low,” lead author Christine Salvatore, the chief of pediatric infectious disease at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, explains in a statement.
While in the hospital, nearly all of the babies stayed in an enclosed incubator within the mother’s room. New mothers donned surgical masks and washed their hands before feeding, cuddling, or changing diapers. Once home, these hygiene standards were discontinued after 14 days, aside from a few parents who were still wearing masks after one month.
“[Maternal] infection does not appear to cause severe illness in these babies,” Marian Knight, a professor of maternal and child population health at the University of Oxford’s National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit who was not involved with the study, tells the BBC. “This small US study also indicates transmission of infection from mother to baby is uncommon with simple precautions such as the wearing of face masks by mums with Covid-19.”
The authors acknowledge the modest sample size and state that more research on modes of mother-to-newborn transmission is needed. 
“At least so far, we don’t have any evidence that babies are getting the virus from the mother after birth and showing up at the hospital horribly sick,” Karen Puopolo, a neonatologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved with the study, tells Science News. 
Puopolo was the lead author on the newest guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which call for masks and hand hygiene, and was developed independently of this study. Previously, the AAP recommended that infected mothers pump breastmilk until they were no longer contagious, rather than directly feeding the baby.
Largest Seroprevalence Study in US Shows Vast COVID-19 Undercount/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KOTO_FEJA
T
he number of COVID-19 infections nationwide is 6 to 24 times higher than the 3.9 million confirmed cases, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The results of the new study, published this week (July 21) in JAMA Internal Medicine by CDC researchers and state health officials, represent the largest antibody survey of its kind. Even accounting for these hidden cases detected in 10 cities across the US, the findings suggest that many of the cities are nowhere near the antibody prevalence required for herd immunity. Additionally, scientists are unsure just how long people retain their antibodies after being infected, and what that means for immunity to the disease.
“These data continue to show that the number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far exceeds the number of reported cases,” Fiona Havers, a CDC researcher who led the study, tells The New York Times. “Many of these people likely had no symptoms or mild illness and may have had no idea that they were infected.” 
See “What Do Antibody Tests For SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?”
Researchers are still working to understand SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has killed more than 142,000 people in the US. As many as 40 percent of cases are thought to be asymptomatic, the authors report in an accompanying editorial, while the symptoms brought on by the disease can be highly variable. 
To better understand how COVID-19 moves unseen throughout the country, researchers collected blood samples from more than 16,000 people who had come into a hospital for routine procedures such as cholesterol testing between March and May. They targeted 10 large cities in Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Florida, Utah, and Washington. At eight of the 10 sites, they were able to retrieve a second round of samples from later in the spring to track changes in antibody prevalence over time.
The percentage of people with COVID-19 antibodies differed by region, although all 10 sites registered some level of disparity between the seroprevalence data and the reported number of cases. 
Antibody prevalence in New York City, for example, jumped from 6.9 percent in late March to more than 23 percent in May, tracking the rapid increase in cases during this time. The latter tally supports an earlier study carried out by the state that tested more than 15,000 people in April and identified antibodies in 22.7 percent of participants. According to the Times, the discrepancies between seroprevalence data and reported cases in New York City amounted to a 12-fold difference in the first round of sampling, down to a 10-fold difference in early May as testing capabilities improved.
New York was the only site to register such high percentages. In other areas, the antibody prevalence was in the single digits. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for instance, it was 1 percent of samples, while other locations ranged between 2 percent and 6 percent. 
Regions with a lower antibody prevalence sometimes yielded the greatest differences from case reports. In Missouri, where the antibody prevalence stayed around 3 percent, the first round of sampling identified 24 times more cases than had been reported, with that number dropping to 13 times more cases by late May when the state was sampled a second time, NPR reports. 
See “How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2”
Taken together, the results further flesh out an earlier report from CDC Director Robert Redfield stating that cases could be 10 higher than what had been reported. They also suggest that the 700,000 tests carried out each day in the US, as reported by the Times, are not nearly enough to capture the full reach of the pandemic. 
The biggest limitation to the current study is that it relies on old data. Because the samples were collected in early spring, true counts of antibody prevalence and case numbers are likely higher now. Florida, for example, has since seen an explosion of cases that would not be reflected in the data included in this study. In addition, because samples were collected during shelter-in-place orders, the authors admit in their editorial that “the outpatient and inpatient populations included in the study are likely not representative” of the general population.
The authors go on to reject the idea that herd immunity could provide large-scale protection any time soon. While researchers have speculated about the potential for natural herd immunity as more people recover from the virus, the results show that most Americans remain susceptible to COVID-19. Even areas like New York City fall far short of the 60 percent to 70 percent threshold needed for herd immunity to become effective.
“Most of us are likely still very vulnerable to this virus and we have a long way to go to control it,” Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study, tells The Washington Post. “This study should put to bed any further argument that we should allow this virus to rip through our communities in order to achieve herd immunity.” 
Big Data and Collaboration Seek to Fight COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, METAMORWORKS

lthough cough and fever have been considered the most tell-tale signs of COVID-19, in May, researchers published a study suggesting that loss of smell and taste were better able to predict who would test positive for the disease. The insight came from data shared by millions of individuals who logged on to a phone app to report what, if any, symptoms they were experiencing on a given day.
The Covid Symptom Tracker app now has nearly 4 million users. Researchers are extracting the massive amounts of data they gather to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks in particular communities and to explore different risk factors for the disease.
“We were one of the earliest bodies to actually identify the importance of a loss of taste or smell as a predictor,” says Andrew Chan, a physician and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and the lead researcher on the project. “We developed the Covid Symptom study app as a means of rapidly collecting data on a large population of individuals, to gather real-time information about COVID in the setting of a rapidly unfolding pandemic.” The app has helped scientists understand the risks healthcare workers face as well as the effects of some underlying factors such as obesity and diabetes. The data aren’t readily available to any researcher, but the team has developed a number of partnerships with those conducting clinical trials and longitudinal research, and is “interested in partnering with investigators who are taking a different approach to COVID,” says Chan.
No one’s ever created a dataset like this in the history of the United States.
—Melissa Haendel, Oregon Health and Science University
They’re not the only ones working to amass COVID-related health data. As the pandemic spread across the globe, researchers have started to aggregate large datasets that can be parsed using artificial intelligence. While some groups, such as those behind the symptom tracker app, have enlisted the assistance of the public, others are relying on cooperation from research hospitals that might otherwise compete with one another.
As the datasets are starting to yield insights that may help providers treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and subsequent post-COVID syndromes, researchers involved say they hope their success will usher in a new era of collaboration in medical research.
“We may transform the way clinical science is done, leveraging the tools and resources of big data and data science in ways that have not been possible,” says Chris Chute, a health informatics researcher at Johns Hopkins University. “We hope that this opportunity demonstrates that the sky does not fall if we actually leverage the data in a responsible way.”
The most ambitious effort in the United States is the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database, supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), a division of the National Institutes of Health. The database is collecting information from electronic health records of patients who have been tested for COVID-19—whether those tests came back positive or negative—or who have reported COVID-like symptoms. Health care providers submit the records and NCATS makes them available for any credentialed researcher to analyze. The team started working on the database back in March, and is starting to review applications from researchers who wish to study the data this week.
“We believe that there’s an enormous amount of talent, not just in academic medical centers, but in computer science departments, data science departments, social studies departments,” says Chute, who is a codirector of N3C. “We’re egalitarian about who can access this data.”
So far, Chute says, 49 institutions have signed on to share their data.
“It’s a movement, really, to share data at this scale in this way,” says Melissa Haendel, who studies medical informatics at Oregon Health and Science University and who directs the project with Chute. “No one’s ever created a dataset like this in the history of the United States.”
Making this dataset functional is a challenge. First, the data from different sources need to be harmonized. For example, different organizations may use different codes to denote gender. One record may say “M” for male, while another uses the whole word. Some may have an option for “other” while another might have a variety of more specific options such as transgender or nonbinary. The scientists have to make sure all these data are combined in a meaningful—and accurate—way.
Since the data include information such as locations and dates necessary to track the outbreak, the team needed to develop secure strategies to protect patient privacy. First, says Chute, the data are housed in a secure enclave, meaning it can’t be downloaded or removed from its server. In fact, it can’t even be viewed directly by most of the researchers using it. Instead, they must program software that can analyze the data and provide answers.
“We are deeply aware that we have a responsibility shepherding a data resource of this sensitivity,” says Chute. These are “data on potentially tens of millions of people as the epidemic continues.”
The team says that as soon as the data are available, there will probably be some “low hanging fruit” that researchers can search for. One of the first questions will be, “can we just identify all the drugs that people are on that have either a positive or a negative effect on any whole population or sub population of patients?” says Haendel.
Stephen Hewitt, a pathologist at the National Cancer Institute who calls himself a “big fan” of N3C, is head of the COVID Digital Pathology Repository (COVID-DPR), which is currently aggregating and digitizing human tissue samples from deceased COVID-19 patients across the country. He anticipates the collection being used it in tandem with N3C.
In 2010, Hewitt created the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network, a database of kidney biopsies that has helped researchers better understand the mechanisms underlying renal disease. “And that was such a success,” he says. “It moved the needle so far.”
But both getting and digitizing patient samples during the pandemic has been challenging. “COVID has disrupted our natural processes of grieving. And oftentimes families aren’t even in the same city because they can’t travel.” says Hewitt.  Because pathologists need permission to take and use the samples, “it’s making it more difficult sometimes for us to get the material simply because we’re chasing next of kin” of deceased patients. Plus, many of the researchers who would normally be responsible for organizing and analyzing the samples aren’t in the lab, because hospitals are focused on clinical care.
Nonetheless, he’s optimistic. He originally set out to get samples from 50 autopsies in three months and is currently on track to get 90 in that timeframe. Hewitt explains that tissue from deceased patients show doctors the extreme versions of damage that the virus is likely causing in the patients who survive and will help researchers address the long-term effects of the disease.

Haendel says she hopes that if the databases are successful, they can help lay the groundwork for responsibly using big data to understand all kinds of health outcomes. “The reason we were allowed to do this is because it’s a national emergency,” she says. “If things all go well and we’re actually able to really create a large collaborative community . . . that’s going to absolutely affect what we do in the long run for all kinds of different disease areas.”
Two COVID-19 Clinical Trials Seek to Enroll Pregnant Women/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BLUE PLANET STUDIO
A
s a translational infectious disease researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who had led many clinical trials for experimental HIV therapies, Katharine Bar was acutely aware that pregnant women are rarely included in such research. Then, in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, she witnessed several pregnant women suffering from severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection being admitted to the UPenn hospital system. As she and colleagues put together protocols for two trials to test infusing blood plasma from recovered patients, also called convalescent plasma, into sick patients as a treatment for COVID-19, Bar knew she wanted to include moms-to-be.
Bar and her colleagues officially launched the trials in May, running one for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and one specifically for COVID-19 patients on ventilators. While no expecting mothers have enrolled to date, their pregnancy would not preclude them from the trials—a first for a clinical study of COVID-19 treatments. The Scientist spoke with Bar about her decision to include pregnant women in her studies and the potential challenges of doing so more commonly in clinical research. 
The Scientist: What led you to do this study, and what exactly are you doing?
Katharine Bar: We thought, especially early in the epidemic, that convalescent plasma was a promising treatment modality for people who are sick with COVID-19. So the concept of convalescent plasma—that you can take [plasma containing] antibodies from people who have recovered from an infection and . . . you can give them . . . to another person who was earlier in their stages of disease and hasn’t made their own antibodies, and this can be helpful for treatment. That is a process that has been used in multiple infections over time. We can give [convalescent plasma] to people in what we believe is a safe way, much more quickly than we can go through the regulatory and research and development process that it takes to either get monoclonal antibodies or other antibody preparations up and going. 
That was the impetus for the studies initially. And I think it still follows. As of right now, there’s been a lot of convalescent plasma being given in a compassionate use framework. The Mayo Clinic has an expanded access program that many hospitals have participated in, and they’ve actually released safety data on more than 20,000 individuals who received COVID-19 convalescent plasma, so we do have a good sense that it is safe. . . . But whether it’s effective and in which populations it’s effective is not yet known. That’s why we wanted to do at Penn a little bit more of a rigorous approach. 
We have two studies. The first study is in mechanically ventilated participants, so quite sick people. And this is a single arm study where we’re giving plasma to all of the [50] individuals. But we designed it in a way that would be parallel to other trials running around the same time so that we can, through an arrangement with these other trials, compare our participants with matched individuals with COVID-19 who were placebo recipients for other trials. . . . The second trial is our own randomized controlled trial. And so within Penn, we’re hoping to enroll up to 80 participants: half the people get plasma and a half of them don’t. And then we compare whether plasma plus standard of care versus standard of care alone [in terms of] safety and efficacy. 
TS: Why did you think it was important to enroll pregnant women?
Ultimately, pregnant women suffer from having fewer drugs available to them, because we don’t test them upfront in the process of clinical trials.
KB: In my previous day job, we do a lot of HIV clinical trials. And I think in HIV, like most other large diseases, we recognize that there’s a disconnect between the full population of individuals who are affected by the disease process and those who are enrolled in clinical trials. And that’s for good reasons and bad reasons. . . . If we’re not sure about the safety, we don’t want to take unnecessary risks. And certainly, we’re concerned about pregnant women—there could be problems that the pregnant woman would uniquely face or that the fetus would face, and so we oftentimes don’t include pregnant women in research because we’re trying to protect pregnant women and their fetuses. But the downside of that is that then when these drugs do become developed and are demonstrated to be safe and effective, we don’t have good understanding of if they are also safe and effective for pregnant women. So ultimately, pregnant women suffer from having fewer drugs available to them, because we don’t test them upfront in the process of clinical trials. So it’s a little bit of a catch 22. 
We have an extremely long track record of safety of giving, not COVID-19 convalescent plasma, but just plasma in general, to lots of different groups, including pregnant women. So we give plasma—fresh frozen plasma or antibody preparations from plasma—we give it to pregnant women all the time [for blood loss], and so we have a good sense of what the safety of plasma is in this population. . . . It’s perhaps easier for a product like convalescent plasma than it is for others [such as a new drug] and so we should take advantage of this and sort of get the ball rolling in this regard. . . . To my knowledge, it’s the first COVID-19 therapeutic trial at Penn that is including pregnant women. 
TS: Was the regulatory approval process more challenging because you included pregnant women in your protocols for these trials?
There was a very strong desire from everyone involved to get this therapy up and going as fast as possible. So for instance, our FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval and our IRB [institutional review board] process was very fast. We got expedited reviews for everything—basically as soon as we sent the protocols in, the IRB convened and reviewed our protocol [and] met with us within a couple of days. . . It was an incredibly expedited process. Part of that is because everything else was shut down and so they were able to dedicate time and energy to getting this moving quickly . . . [and also] because plasma has been shown to be safe in many contexts, as well as with COVID-19. But for pregnant women, we had to go through the full IRB review process. So it wasn’t that extraordinary of a level of regulatory or logistics, but everything was so fast paced for the primary trial process, that sort of going back to normal levels of convening the full IRB, giving them the appropriate amount of time to review everything, meeting their stipulations, resubmitting, etc.—that took a little extra time. So it was a two- to three-week delay to get pregnant women included in each of the protocols after we[started enrolling in the general population]. 
TS: How far are you along in enrollment in each of the two trials? 
We have about 25 participants in each. 
TS: And do you have any pregnant women?
We do not, in fact. Since we opened both of these studies, basically the beginning of May for mechanically ventilated and the middle of May for our randomized control hospitalized patients, we haven’t had any pregnant women who met enrollment criteria. So there are lots of COVID-positive pregnant women coming through the Penn system. But fortunately, in the past . . . month and a half, we haven’t had any that were substantially symptomatic from COVID pneumonia. . . . So that’s great. And I think that reflects [the fact that] numbers in general in our region are going down. 
TS: Can you speak a little bit more about the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials more broadly, even after the pandemic?
It is a burden for these trials, for regulatory and safety [reasons], to include pregnant women. And of course, any adverse event in a pregnant woman or for a fetus would be a really serious and negative outcome. But ultimately we have to deal with that in order to get to the place we want to be, which is where we understand what is safe and what is unsafe for pregnant women so we can more effectively treat that population, which is always going . . . to need to be treated for the same things that everyone else deals within society. 
Seeking an Early COVID-19 Drug, Researchers Look to Interferons/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, INDUSTRYVIEW
E
arly this year, when COVID-19 was still a localized outbreak in China, Eleanor Fish, an immunologist at the University of Toronto, reached out to colleagues in Wuhan to explore the possibility of evaluating interferon therapy in patients infected with the coronavirus. Fish has been studying interferons (IFNs)—proteins produced by the body in response to viral infections—for close to 35 years, and her previous favorable results with a synthetic version during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada prompted the idea.
Fish’s colleagues in China connected her with Qiong Zhou, a physician who was at the time treating COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union Hospital. Zhou was very receptive to the proposal, Fish recalls. As this was an outbreak, there wasn’t any time to optimize an IFN for use against SARS-CoV-2, and Fish and Zhou had to make do with what was available and what had previously been tried successfully in other coronavirus infections. For a clinical study, Zhou’s team used IFN-alpha-2b, first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer in 1986, thanks to its immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects. The researchers tested the IFN along with arbidol, a widely used broad-spectrum antiviral drug, in 77 patients who were admitted to Union Hospital in January and February with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Each of them had moderate symptoms and none required intensive care.
The results, published May 15 in Frontiers in Immunology, found that patients treated with IFN-alpha-2b alone or in combination with arbidol cleared the virus from their upper airways an average of seven days faster than the group given arbidol alone. Hand-in-hand with that, blood levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were dramatically reduced in patients receiving IFN-alpha-2b. Fish adds that as-yet unpublished data show that IFN-alpha-2b also limited lung abnormalities as evidenced by CT scans.
The general consensus in the field is that any antiviral in COVID should be used early, even preventively.

“I think it is a decent clinical report, and they look out for inflammatory markers, which is important,” says Andreas Wack, an immunologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who works on IFNs but was not involved in this study. That’s because IFN-alpha is known to induce a proinflammatory milieu. Fish says that in her study, IFN-alpha-2b–treated patients did not show evidence of a cytokine storm, one of the dangerous immune responses observed in some COVID-19 patients.
Jordan Feld, a hepatologist at Toronto General Hospital, says that though the study was not a randomized controlled trial, it nevertheless gives some promise to the idea of using IFNs in COVID-19. On July 20, a UK company called Synairgen reported unpublished data from a Phase 2 trial of an experimental IFN drug, nebulized IFN-beta, that appeared to reduce the risk of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developing severe disease by 79 percent.
Any new leads on drugs are welcome in this pandemic. Only the antiviral agent remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for treating patients with severe COVID-19. On June 25, encouraging preliminary results of the UK RECOVERY trial prompted the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to recommend dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, for treating COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation or those requiring supplemental oxygen. But there are no drugs approved yet to be given early in the infection or preventively to those at high risk.
In such a bleak therapeutic scenario, mounting evidence from laboratory studies and a couple of clinical trials on IFNs, either alone or in combination with other antivirals, suggests that synthetic IFNs might be able to fill in this gap.
Viruses and interferons are mutually antagonistic

There are three types of natural IFNs, each secreted by their own suite of cell types. Both type I (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) and type III (IFN-lambda) are antiviral proteins produced early on in infected cells to protect other cells in the vicinity. “Once the genetic material [of the virus] is exposed, [IFNs] will chew it up,” says Fish. At the same time, IFNs recruit to the site of infection immune cells that will also help clear the virus.
IFNs I and III, for the most part, are part and parcel of the innate immune response of the body, with type III specifically involved in the localized immune response at sites where pathogens enter the body, such as mucosal barriers of the lungs, intestines, and liver. But the body’s natural IFN response doesn’t appear to be enough to thwart SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A paper published in Cell on May 28 by Benjamin tenOever, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, and colleagues found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces low levels of type I and type III IFNs in ferrets. And Fish and Wack note that all viruses have numerous mechanisms to dampen the IFN response.
See “Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV”
It stands to reason, therefore, that giving synthetic IFN drugs would boost the antiviral immunity of the body, perhaps giving the host the upper hand.

Type I or type III: Which is better to fight COVID-19?
While IFN specialists posit that type I and III IFN drugs are attractive therapeutic options in COVID-19, they disagree about which of the two would be most suitable in COVID-19, and experimental evidence indicates that both types have potential.
A study published June 19 demonstrates that the type I IFN-beta-1a, currently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, was highly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. A preprint posted May 7 shows that treatment with the clinical candidate IFN-lambda-1a, a type III IFN, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication both in vitro and in mouse models. Another preprint posted May 20 demonstrates that both type I and type III IFNs reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cultures.
Although no synthetic IFN-lambda is yet FDA-approved, preliminary results in a clinical trial in hepatitis D patients show that it has the same antiviral potency as type I IFN but is much safer and better tolerated. A study in mice found that synthetic IFN-lambda was as effective as IFN-alpha in treating influenza but didn’t have the same proinflammatory effects.
The limited side effects of IFN-lambda could be due to the distribution pattern of receptors, which appear exclusively on barrier surfaces, such as the epithelium of the lung, intestine, and liver, whereas receptors for type I IFNs are ubiquitous, says Jeffrey Glenn, a professor at Stanford University and the founder of Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, a company that manufactures an IFN-lambda drug. “The benefit-to-risk is really compelling [for IFN-lambda]. IFN-alpha is a very tough drug to take as it has lots of side effects.” These include flu-like symptoms, fatigue, low blood counts, insomnia, and mood disturbances.
I would be very, very, very cautious about this.
—Andreas Wack, Francis Crick Institute
Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, a senior investigator at the NIH who discovered and cloned a novel IFN-lambda gene in 2013 and is not associated with any clinical trials on IFNs for COVID-19, tells The Scientist in an email that type I IFN is a very potent antiviral but its mode of action is more inflammatory. “There is enough inflammation in the COVID lungs and avoiding any additional inflammation is critical,” she says. “If using any interferons, we suggest using IFN-lambda.”
Michael Gale Jr., an immunologist at the University of Washington who is currently working on how host cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 and launch the innate immune response but is not involved in IFN-lambda trials, also supports the clinical use of IFN-lambda. “With SARS-CoV-2, it’s important not to activate the lymphocytes as they are already activated in the inflammatory process.” As the receptors for IFN-lambda are not expressed on lymphocytes, immune cells are not activated.
IFN-lambda trialists say they worry that type I IFN, which is known to be proinflammatory, could precipitate a cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. A study published July 10 in Science Immunology confirms that the type I IFN response is indeed proinflammatory in coronavirus infections and plays a pivotal role in the development of severe COVID-19.
“I would be very hesitant to use type I IFN,” says Thomas Marron, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who is leading an IFN-lambda trial.
But for many researchers, type I IFN is not off the table for treating COVID-19. While Feld, an IFN-lambda proponent, is likewise concerned about type I IFNs’ safety in this context, he says what is appealing about type I IFNs is that being approved drugs, they can be mass-produced and given right away. “Obviously, even if we prove that IFN-lambda is highly effective, getting it mass produced will be a challenge.” Additionally, advocates of type I IFN drugs posit that the concerns about IFN-alpha’s tolerability are not so much an issue with short-term treatment in an acute viral infection such as COVID-19. And as SARS-CoV-2 spreads systemically, IFN-lambda won’t protect all cell types.
See “Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV”
IFN-lambda has another downside. If given for too long or at too high a dose, Gale cautions, “we could run into problems where it would impede tissue regeneration,” particularly in the lungs. In a study published in June, Wack’s team found that type I and III IFNs activate antiproliferative and cell death pathways in airway epithelial cells of mice infected with influenza virus and that excessive or prolonged IFN production disrupted lung epithelial repair during recovery from the viral infection.
Harvard Medical School’s Ivan Zanoni led a second study also published last month that generated similar results regarding IFN-lambda using a synthetic version of SARS-CoV-2. He tells The Scientist that IFNs might be very good when given early in COVID-19 to limit the spread of infection. “When you move to severe COVID-19, ICU patients or hospitalized patients, one has to very careful as we have found that [both type I and type III] IFNs have a dark side,” he says.
“The general consensus in the field is that any antiviral in COVID should be used early, even preventively,” says Prokunina-Olsson. “In later disease stages, when the infection spreads to the lungs, any antiviral could be dangerous” because of the risk of a cytokine storm or damage to lung tissue by immune cells.
Both Wack and Zanoni emphasize to The Scientist the need to exercise caution with such potent antivirals as IFNs. “It’s complicated,” says Wack, “and I would be very, very, very cautious about this.”

Putting IFNs to the clinical test
Both type I and III IFNs are being tested in clinical trials globally. In a Phase 2 multicenter randomized trial in Hong Kong that was published in The Lancet on May 8, triple antiviral therapy with injectable IFN-beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir (an oral protease inhibitor), and ribavirin (an oral nucleoside analog) was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in reducing the duration of virus shedding, diminishing symptoms, and enabling patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 to go home from the hospital sooner.
The ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trial from Synairgen in the UK is testing inhaled IFN-beta-1a against a placebo in hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, non-hospitalized patients with chronic health conditions, and frontline health workers who are at a high risk of coronavirus infections. Evangelos Andreakos, an immunologist based in Athens, Greece, says using inhaled type I IFN is an interesting approach that may sidestep the drug’s systemic side effects by delivering it directly to the lungs.
Other trials include the WHO SOLIDARITY trial, launched on March 20, that includes testing an IFN-beta in conjunction with other antiviral drugs, and an open-label trial in China, which reported May 7 in a preprint that IFN-alpha nose drops appeared to prevent coronavirus infections in close to 3,000 medical workers. In addition, Fish is actively seeking partners to conduct clinical trials on IFN-alpha in COVID-19 patients in India and elsewhere.
For type III IFNs, there are currently six clinical trials in the US and Canada that are testing Eiger BioPharmaceuticals’s IFN-lambda on a wide spectrum of COVID-19 patients.
Upinder Singh, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University who is running one of these trials on IFN-lambda, says that her study is focusing exclusively on COVID-19 outpatients. The rationale is that 80 percent of patients who get infected will never get admitted. “But they are the ones who are spreading it in the community. Our goal is to identify patients who are very early in their disease, the idea being that if you can get to them early, you could reduce viral shedding and decrease the time in quarantine,” she says. About 60 patients have been recruited in the Stanford trial so far.
A trial Marron is running at Mount Sinai and another at Massachusetts General Hospital Boston are testing Eiger’s IFN-lambda in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, whereas a trial at John Hopkins University is testing the preventive use of the drug in people who are at high risk of getting infected. Meanwhile, preliminary results from a trial of inpatients and outpatients that Feld is leading show that the drug is safe and has minimal side effects, he tells The Scientist.
Clifford Lane, the deputy director for clinical research and special projects at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, points to the NIH treatment guidelines, which recommend against the use of type I IFNs in COVID-19 except in the context of a clinical trial, the rationale being that these IFNs generally showed no benefit when they were used in patients with other coronavirus infections and that the significant toxicities of type I IFNs outweigh the potential benefits.
The NIH guidelines also state that of the two type I IFNs, IFN-beta is better tolerated than IFN-alpha, but the results of a recent randomized controlled trial do not support the use of IFN-beta-1a in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Remarking on the enthusiasm surrounding the use of IFN-lambda in COVID-19, Lane says, “I am open-minded about any and all new approaches as long as they are tested in a rigorous fashion.” 
Could COVID-19 Trigger Chronic Disease in Some People?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PONOMARIOVA_MARIA
W
hen 32-year-old artist Hannah Davis fell sick in late March this year, her symptoms were so severe that even watching movies in bed in her Brooklyn apartment was impossible, she says. She began having difficulties reading text messages, and she soon lost the ability to follow a movie plot.  
While some flu-like symptoms, such as exhaustion and a cough, improved over time, her memory loss and other cognitive difficulties have only grown worse, she says, and she also experiences sporadic bursts of blurred vision, a racing heart, difficulties breathing, insomnia, and various aches and pains. “It sounds really insane,” she tells The Scientist. “I’ve been sick for three months, which just sounds so ridiculous to so many doctors.” 
While the first physicians she saw didn’t take her symptoms seriously, Davis says, she found support in an online group for COVID-19 survivors battling long-term effects. In an informal survey of 640 of the groups’ members conducted by Davis and others, many report prolonged symptoms, from chest pain and gastrointestinal issues to cognitive problems and debilitating fatigue. Only around 23 percent of respondents had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, however. Some, like Davis, were denied tests early on because the tests were reserved for the most critically ill (often hospitalized cases only), but based on the bizarre nature of their symptoms that coincided with the wave of coronavirus infections in the US, many members of the online group are certain they have been infected. (Davis later tested negative around a month after symptom onset, when viral loads would normally have faded below detectable levels, but her doctors concluded she had had COVID-19 based on her symptoms.) 
I’ve been sick for three months, which just sounds so ridiculous to so many doctors.
—Hannah Davis
Despite uncertainties around whether some cases are in fact SARS-CoV-2 infections, “long-haulers” such as those in the online group point to the possibility that COVID-19 is not just a transient respiratory disease, but could manifest as neurological and physical symptoms that persist even months after people fall ill. Although many of them may yet recover in the coming months, some scientists are becoming increasingly worried that some may end up with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating and poorly understood condition associated with some viral infections. In a press conference last week, for instance, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci noted that some of the long-haulers’ symptoms resemble those of ME/CFS. Studies are now underway to track whether some long-haulers develop the disease, and if so, to investigate its underlying mechanisms and possible avenues for treatment quickly. 
“This is a massive infection of millions and millions of people. I think one has to be really concerned about the long-term consequences,” notes Avindra Nath, a neurovirologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “A lot of emphasis early on has been on providing treatments and vaccines and antibodies and all that kind of stuff, but the long-term consequences have not received the attention that they deserve.” 
Viral infections and ME/CFS 
A feeling of fatigue and exhaustion isn’t unusual in the aftermath of viral infections, but it usually passes. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that in some patients viruses could be involved in triggering ME/CFS, a distinct clinical syndrome characterized by lasting fatigue that worsens after exercise or mental exertion—a hallmark physicians call post-exertional malaise. A light walk or completing a questionnaire can leave those with ME/CFS bedridden for days or even weeks. 
See “Infographic: What is ME/CFS?”
“You don’t see that in any other condition,” says Alain Moreau of the University of Montreal who directs a research network for ME/CFS. “We have a large group of patients that are housebound. Even taking a shower could take hours, or they sometimes skip [it] because they cannot do it.” An inability to concentrate, or “brain fog,” is also common in the disease, adds Columbia University immunologist Mady Hornig.
The disease—formerly known simply as chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS—has long been stigmatized to the point of being ignored by many physicians and researchers, in large part due to its mysterious etiology. Doctors would rule out a number of diagnoses, such as viral infections or neurological diseases, and conclude that there was nothing wrong with such patients, sometimes advising them to simply get more exercise, which would make their condition worse, notes Frances Williams, a genomic epidemiologist at King’s College London. An incident in which a high-profile study purported to identify definitive causes, which later turned out to be false, may also have discouraged scientists from studying ME/CFS, Nath adds. And while some drugs have been trialed in ME/CFS patients over the years, the results so far have been inconclusive, Moreau says, leaving few treatment options for the disease. 
In part because of this long-term neglect of the disease, many patients prefer the term myalgic encephalomyelitis over chronic fatigue syndrome. ME implies a pathological process: an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. However, Williams and Nath are quick to note that there is so far little evidence for encephalomyelitis in the condition, save for a small Japanese study that found elevated levels of inflammatory markers in the brains of ME/CFS patients and small changes in cytokines in their spinal fluid. Much of the research community, including the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, have settled on calling the disease ME/CFS. 
The question is not if [some] will develop ME/CFS—it’s how many.
—Alain Moreau, University of Montreal
Although it’s still a mystery what causes the disease, according to one survey, nearly 75 percent of ME/CFS patients have described viral infections prior to the onset of their symptoms. Other studies have linked particular pathogens, including West Nile, Ebola, and Epstein-Barr viruses, with the development of ME/CFS-like symptoms in substantial numbers of infected people. This association was also observed with SARS-CoV-2’s close relative, SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS epidemic of 2003. One study conducted a year after the SARS outbreak in Toronto found that fatigue was common among survivors, and 17 percent of them still hadn’t returned to work due to long-term health issues. Even three years after Toronto’s SARS outbreak, a study found widespread fatigue and achiness among those who had been infected. 
Such findings leave Moreau with little doubt that SARS-CoV-2 could also leave some people with long-term disability, he says. “With this very severe COVID-19 disease, where we’re now dealing with millions of people suffering from it worldwide, the question is not if [some] will develop ME/CFS—it’s how many.” 
Hornig notes that some of the long-hauler symptoms described in Davis’s report overlap with those common in ME/CFS, although only the passage of time will tell whether some long-haulers will meet the clinical definition of the disease. The rule of thumb is six months, Nath says, citing one of his own ME/CFS studies suggesting that patients rarely recover if their symptoms persist longer than half a year. He and others are now beginning to investigate not just whether, but how SARS-CoV-2 might lead to ME/CFS. 
Mysterious mechanisms 
Although researchers have looked extensively in the blood of ME/CFS patients for evidence of elevated levels of actively replicating viruses, they’ve never found any, Nath says. Some patients, however, exhibit abnormally high levels of certain inflammation-driving molecules, such as interferon gamma or other cytokines, a possible sign of an overactive immune system. “Those are [often] the same cytokines, the same inflammatory markers, that we see are raised in patients with COVID who have the cytokine storm when they’re very sick,” Hornig says. “It may well be that we’re seeing clues about how the immune system is reacting to COVID that actually leads to long-term problems.” 
See “Discovered: Metabolic Mechanism of Cytokine Storms”
Normally, the body reins in the immune response after an infection is tamped down, but perhaps SARS-CoV-2 infections could cause the immune system to get stuck in that overactive state in some people, pouring a persistent shower of cytokines into the blood, notes Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. It’s theoretically possible that the virus could seek long-term refuge in an organ such as the brain that isn’t easily accessible to the immune system, Iwasaki says. This could cause a consistent trickle of virus particles to escape into the blood, where they aggravate an unceasing immune response, she adds, although with a few exceptions, this has never been shown for RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, Nath says. 
Alternatively, the virus itself may be completely eradicated from the body, but leave behind snippets of viral RNA in a reservoir organ. The RNA itself, or the translated protein—which the human body’s own machinery would readily manufacture from the viral RNA—could set off immune reactions once they’re found by the body’s B cells and T cells, Iwasaki and Nath suggest. Possibly in line with this theory, there are some reports of persisting fragments of viral RNA in the throats of people who recovered from COVID-19 months before.  
See “Could Curbing Runaway Immune Responses Treat COVID-19?”
But the mechanism that Nath considers most plausible is that the immune chaos unleashed by SARS-CoV-2 in some patients somehow triggers autoimmune reactions. On occasion, during the process of instructing T cells which proteins to attack, a macrophage presents one of the body’s own proteins to a T cell. Such rogue T cells are usually eliminated by the immune system, but with the body’s inflammatory signals going haywire during a viral infection, some might escape that culling process, Iwasaki says. A similar mechanism has been proposed for how viral infections could lead to the myelin-attacking autoimmune reactions observed in multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, Italian doctors recently observed autoimmune-like symptoms in severely affected COVID-19 patients that mimic a condition known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Guillain-Barré has also been linked with infections of certain herpesviruses and Zika virus. 
There are other ways SARS-CoV-2 could lead to autoimmunity, Hornig notes. Once viral RNA or proteins slip inside immune cells—either through infection or other uptake mechanisms—they could disrupt mitochondrial function, altering the cells’ metabolism and function and making them more likely to trigger autoimmune reactions. Perhaps that could help explain why some researchers have found antibodies in ME/CFS patients against receptors of the autonomic nervous system, which controls functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing, she adds. 
It’s still not clear how immune overactivation could lead to some ME/CFS symptoms, however. It’s possible that chronic immune activation simply drains the body of energy, in a similar way as the growth of tumor cells causes fatigue in cancer patients, Nath suggests. Or maybe the process starts with viral infection in the brain, and that then disrupts the organ’s communication with the immune system, Nath says. “It’s possible that maybe there is some low-grade encephalitis, and [inflammation] in the brain, and that is somehow driving the abnormalities in the immune system and causing this fatigue-like syndrome,” he says. 
There could be other mechanisms at play that don’t necessarily involve autoimmunity, Moreau notes. In an effort to find a biomarker for ME/CFS to help improve clinicians’ diagnoses, he and his colleagues have found in yet-unpublished work that there are unique patterns of microRNA sequences detectable in patients’ blood compared to healthy controls, suggesting that the disease is associated with widespread changes in gene expression. Perhaps viral infections can trigger epigenetic changes in gene expression and downstream metabolic alterations which then cause ME/CFS symptoms, he suggests. 
Hornig says it’s important to keep an open mind to different mechanisms that may be taking place in long-hauler patients as researchers begin to study the phenomenon. 
Tracking long-haulers
If COVID-19 can lead to an autoimmune disease, that process should be evident in patients’ blood in the form of T cells or other immune machinery directed against human proteins, Iwasaki says. She and her colleagues have started collecting blood samples from hundreds of hospitalized patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to track their disease and compare the immune profiles of those who recover swiftly with those who don’t. “That would be our first look at whether anything strange is going on,” she says. 
Williams and Hornig are both making use of apps they and others have developed to identify and track the progression of long-haulers. Williams’s app, which encourages people to log SARS-CoV-2 infections and submit regular reports on their symptoms, was released just before the March peak of infections in the UK and has been downloaded by 3 million people so far. Of them, around 3,000 are twins who are part of a long-term study of how genetic factors influence health, and have already provided blood as well as genetic samples before the pandemic. Williams and her colleagues will use the data to try to tease out genetic and immunological factors that help determine who suffers from long-term disease. “That’s going to be essential, I think, for working out what’s going on. Because once you find genetic abnormalities, then [skeptics who still dismiss ME/CFS as a psychiatric disease] will have to accept it,” she says. 
Nath and Moreau, who are both also launching long-term studies of COVID-19 patients’ recovery, see the pandemic as a golden opportunity to finally elucidate what causes ME/CFS, and to find treatment avenues quickly. This will not only benefit COVID-19 survivors, they say, but also the millions of other people worldwide who already have ME/CFS, and whose disease onset is so far in the past that it’s impossible to know what triggered it. 
“I think people—agencies, Congress, everybody—should be really focused” on the possibility that some COVID-19 patients will develop ME/CFS, Nath says. “They really need to appropriate resources to quickly get into this field, get lots of people interested in studying these patients, and try to get the bottom of it. . . . If you don’t do it, it’ll be a missed opportunity.” 
Coronavirus Vaccine Data Are Targets for Foreign Hackers/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JUSUN
Update (July 21): Today, the US Justice Department issued an indictment against two Chinese hackers linked to the country's intelligence services for attempting to steal proprietary COVID-19 vaccine information, The New York Times reports.
A
hacking group affiliated with the Russian government is targeting academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies worldwide to glean information on COVID-19 vaccine research, according to Western powers. Intelligence officials from Britain, the United States, and Canada released a joint report this week condemning Cozy Bear—the same group responsible for email hacking during the 2016 US presidential election—for its use of malware to gain access to secure computers.
“We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” Paul Chichester, the director of operations for Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), says in a statement released alongside the report. The document goes on to state that Cozy Bear is “almost certainly” operating as “part of Russian intelligence services.”
While the report did not identify particular groups targeted by the hackers or release details about what, if anything, had been stolen, attacks were said to have been carried out in the US, UK, and Canada, with Reuters reporting that Cozy Bear malware had also been used in Japan, China, and Africa in the last year. 
US and UK intelligence officials had first warned in a statement back in May that the increase in telework brought on by the pandemic could leave more people susceptible to cyberattacks. In the statement Chichester said, “we recommend healthcare policy makers and researchers take our actionable steps to defend themselves,” although he made no mention of Russian interference specifically.
At a cybersecurity conference held last month, Tonya Ugoretz, a deputy assistant director with the FBI’s cyber division, spoke about how the pandemic has complicated the motivations behind these attacks. In addition to “profit-motivated criminals,” she said, foreign governments had “their own urgent demands for information about the pandemic and about things like vaccine research,” the Associated Press reports.
The hacking group Cozy Bear has been described by government officials as “aggressive” and “nothing if not flexible,” BBC News reports, constantly changing its methods to evade detection. In the most recent attacks, the group deployed malware called WELLMAIL, SOREFANG, and WELLMESS, the latter of which was found within multiple US pharmaceutical companies, according to three investigators who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
In other instances, Cozy Bear used phishing or spear phishing attacks that use fake emails to trick people into providing sensitive information. Spear phishing in particular targets a specific person, appearing to come from a trusted contact. These emails often include personal details meant to make the message more convincing.
Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, denied the government’s involvement in any state-sponsored hacking. “We don’t know who tried to carry out the hacking attacks in the United Kingdom, but Russia certainly has nothing to do with it,” he said, speaking to the state news agency Tass. “We strongly reject these groundless accusations against us.”

esides our biological immune system, psychological research has recently found evidence that humans have a “behavioral immune system”— a tendency to avoid people who may be carrying disease. Besides avoiding obviously ill people, psychologists think humans universally tend to conform to our own “in-group” and avoid people who are different from us, because originally, we were trying to avoid infection.
This was actually a risk during our early evolution. When we were wandering hunter- gatherers and encountered another wandering tribe, the strangers might have encountered different diseases and be carrying germs to which they had acquired resistance, but we had not. This was especially true because some aspects of disease resistance are genetic, and we would have shared fewer genes with another wandering tribe than we do now with fellow city dwellers. The disease risks that separated populations may pose to each other were confirmed with a vengeance when most of the native people of the Americas died of European diseases after Columbus arrived. Europeans got syphilis back.
HACHETTE BOOKS, JUNE 2020
There is evidence the behavioral immune system underlies tribalism and xenophobia. People with stronger disgust responses to descriptions and pictures of things that might pose a disease risk, like dead cats or rotten food, tend to be more xenophobic and politically conservative, as are people from places with more pathogens, now or historically.
Researchers have focused on “authoritarian personality,” a set of personality characteristics, partly determined by genes, which include a desire for order, obedience, conformity, and cohesion within the in-group with which the person identifies. Having those characteristics made it more likely that a person would vote for Donald Trump in the US, or Brexit in Britain, in 2016, more than any other variable measured.
Cambridge psychologist Leor Zmigrod has discovered that people who live in US states and cities with a higher prevalence of diseases you catch from humans—but not diseases you get from animals, like Lyme disease—are more likely to have authoritarian personalities and to have voted for Donald Trump. States with more pathogens also tended to have more laws that restrict minorities, such as LGBTQ people. No other variable, such as education or life expectancy, correlated as well.
Other research has found that activating the behavioral immune system, either with a real disease outbreak or with disgusting images or mentions of disease, shifts people’s political attitudes in an authoritarian direction. Canadian psychologist Mark Schaller, who coined the term “behavioral immune system,” found that in 2014, Americans were more likely to tell pollsters they would vote Republican after the appearance of Ebola cases in the US, especially in places with a heightened interest in the disease as reflected by Google searches for “Ebola.” The same went for conservative voting intentions among Canadians.
This fits with a history of sometimes violent xenophobia and hostility to strangers after epidemics. European cities slaughtered Jews and gypsies during the Black Death of 1347. In 1793, Philadelphia blamed a yellow fever outbreak on traveling actors. White North Americans have blamed cholera on Irish immigrants, AIDS on Haitians, plague on Chinese immigrants—Honolulu burned its Chinatown—and SARS and COVID-19 on ethnic Chinese. The Centre for Economic Policy Research says the 1918 flu pandemic led to greater mistrust of governments. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump blamed Latin American immigrants for “tremendous infectious disease.” All the claims were groundless.
A lot of psychological researchers are now collecting data on the political impact of COVID-19, Schaller told me. “If COVID-19 elevates the allure of authoritarian ideologies, the effects could be long-lasting,” says Zmigrod, as she finds those ideologies are more common in places that merely had more infectious disease in the past than in places that didn’t. That could be especially true if COVID-19 doesn’t quite leave but continues to circulate.
This impulse toward division is troubling when the world needs greater collaboration, not less, to defeat the shared risk of disease. The least likely prospect for cooperation now seems to be between the US and China, with their respective leaders trading barbs and blaming the other for the virus. Yet the need is great. In February, Shi Zhengli, Kevin Olival, and 21 other emerging disease researchers made a detailed case for the US and China to work “synergistically” on research into pandemic threats. Only better understanding of disease ecology, they wrote, “can avert the increasing numbers of catastrophes in waiting.”

Spike Structure Gives Insight into SARS-CoV-2 Evolution/-/ABOVE: Two models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein show the closed receptor binding domain (tan, left) and the open receptor binding domain (tan, right).

t’s clear that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, is most closely related to a group of viruses that usually infect bats. But exactly how and where it evolved to become such an efficient respiratory pathogen remains to be seen. Now, in a study published July 9 in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, researchers have determined that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and of the closely related bat coronavirus RaTG13—while similarly structured overall—differ in their stability and affinity for binding ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect human cells. 
The substantial difference in the spike protein of the closest viral relative “tells you that this was not a direct jump from this virus into humans,” says Amesh Adalja, a physician who studies emerging infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was not involved in the work. It’s likely that SARS-CoV-2 “had been evolving in some other species—possibly an intermediate species—before it acquired the ability to be this human pathogen of such a degree that it is today.” 
A group of researchers in structural biologist Steve Gamblin’s lab at the Francis Crick Institute in the United Kingdom specializes in understanding how changes in the shapes of proteins on the surface of the influenza virus allow it to jump between different species, Donald Benton, a postdoc in the Gamblin lab, tells The Scientist. Earlier this year, when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was gaining steam, they decided to devote their expertise to asking the same type of questions about the coronavirus, focusing on its iconic spike proteins that protrude from the viral surface. 
Previous work showed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein must be cut between two amino acids at the junction between the portion of the protein that binds a receptor and the domain of the protein responsible for fusing with the host cell membrane. Rather than cutting the protein in two, this cleavage event—performed for SARS-CoV-2 by the human protease furin—is thought to increase flexibility in the protein so that it can enter mammalian cells. To investigate how this cleavage affects the structure of the protein, Benton and colleagues generated a version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the furin cleavage site intact and then exposed that protein to furin to generate a cleaved version. 
See “Scientists Scan for Weaknesses in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein”
In the uncleaved form, the protein was stable, with three components known as receptor-binding domains (RBDs), which are thought to bind ACE2, tightly tucked into the top of the protein. After furin cleavage, one of the RBDs rotated to open a surface at the top of the protein for ACE2 interaction. The findings indicate that furin cleavage appears to make the spike protein more likely to adopt an open shape that allows it bind to the receptor and enter human cells. 
According to a study published in February, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share about 96 percent of their genomes and about 93 percent sequence similarity in their spike protein genes, making RaTG13 the closest SARS-CoV-2 relative found yet. In work published in April, researchers showed that the amino acid sequences of the two proteins were least similar—around 90 percent—in the RBDs and that the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein is absent in RaTG13, findings Benton and colleagues confirmed. 
The authors of the new paper also observed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds ACE2 about 1,000 times more tightly than the RaTG13 spike protein.
“It looks as if this particular bat virus wouldn’t directly be able to infect humans because of its weak ability to bind to the human receptor,” Benton tells The Scientist. 
“We probably still haven’t found the correct bat virus that actually did make this leap” to people, he says, though there are some coronaviruses in pangolins—scale-covered mammals found in Asia and Africa—that have similar RBDs in their spike proteins. 
In a study published July 1, researchers proposed that recombination events between multiple coronaviruses from different species—potentially including RaTG13—could have led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, an idea that’s supported by findings of the current study, according to Benton and his colleagues. “That’s not just plausible, I think it’s also parsimonious,” says Adam Frost, a structural biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who did not participate in either study. “Where that recombination event took place remains unknown . . . and it may be very hard to be absolutely sure.”
Beyond the evolutionary insight, these new structures may also help researchers generate tools—such as antibodies and synthetic ACE2 domains—that could attach to the RBD and prevent it from engaging the endogenous ACE2, Frost explains. “Big picture, these new structural states will help us both develop and understand those kinds of therapeutic reagents.”

CDC Bypassed Under New COVID-19 Reporting Guidelines/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SSHEPARD
B
eginning today (July 15), President Donald Trump’s administration is ordering hospitals to report their COVID-19 patient information directly to a new database managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, effectively cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention out of the flow of data. In order to force a timely compliance, a letter sent by the administration to state governors this week recommended deploying of the National Guard to collect the data themselves.
While federal officials say the new guidelines will make data reporting more streamlined and centralized, opponents claim that the move sidelines the nation’s main public health agency even as cases continue to rise. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently makes much of its data freely available, a boon for the many groups using this information to populate their disease models and direct their work. Health and Human Services (HHS) has yet to share details on which data will be made available.
“Historically, CDC has been the place where public health data has been sent, and this raises questions about not just access for researchers but access for reporters, access for the public to try to better understand what is happening with the outbreak,” Jen Kates, the director of global health and HIV policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation, tells The New York Times
Under the current system set to be scrapped, around 25,000 medical centers report their information each day to the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network, the Times reports. CDC analysts use the information to write up detailed reports for states twice a week and for certain federal agencies on a daily basis. The information helps officials track trends in each state and identify where additional resources should be allocated.
Instead, individual hospitals will now report their information to either their state (pending a written release from HHS) or to the federally contracted health data firm TeleTracking, which will in turn coordinate the federal reporting. In a letter from HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the federal government’s Coronavirus Task Force, sent to state governors this week and obtained by The Washington Post, the pair say they ordered the changes because many hospitals were failing to report their data quickly enough.
“Today, the CDC still has at least a week lag in reporting hospital data,” Michael Caputo, an HHS spokesman, tells the Times. “America requires it in real time. The new, faster and complete data system is what our nation needs to defeat the coronavirus, and the CDC, an operating division of H.H.S., will certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response. They will simply no longer control it.”
Some medical professionals argue that the lag stems from the fact that federal regulations have shifted several times during the pandemic. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association, tells the Times, “it has been an administrative hassle and confusing to constantly be shifting gears on reporting while hospitals are on the front lines during a pandemic.”
The choice to deploy the National Guard to ensure compliance by hospitals appears to many hospital industry leaders to be an unnecessarily aggressive measure, the Post reports. “Given our track record of being cooperative to evolving data requests, it’s perplexing that the possibility of using the National Guard has been suggested,” says Rick Pollack, the president of the American Hospital Association.
Internal emails exchanged between Daniel Abel, a member of the HHS team overseeing the federal response to the pandemic, and HHS general counsel Robert Charrow hint at indecision over this policy at the federal level. While earlier drafts of the letter sent to governors this week had at first asked states to deploy the Guard, the final version suggested it as an option.
“As a practical matter, I cannot imagine how the National Guard would be able to collect data at the hospital itself nor the number of Guards who would be exposed to COVID-19 in the process,” Charrow wrote in one email shared with the Post. “I believe that using National Guard troops to gather these data would be counter-productive.”
A group of hospitals has since protested in a letter to Birx. In the letter, hospital officials claim that the industry has been complying with the data requests and that most hospitals have been submitting the required information.
Analysis Links Poor Air Quality to Increased COVID-19 Deaths/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

ir pollution and COVID-19 are both well known in causing or exacerbating respiratory distress, and a new analysis suggests that the two factors may interact. As part of a series of reports from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, researchers have found that regions in the Netherlands with higher air pollution have greater numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, they stress that the findings do not prove a causal relationship. 
The Netherlands, home to more than 17 million people, has experienced more than 50,000 cases of COVID-19. The study compared air quality readings from 355 municipalities in the country, including data on nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter. The team found that areas that had even slightly higher pollutant levels tended to have more cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. The authors calculated that if the most polluted areas, which measured a 12.3 µg/m3 concentration of fine particulate matter, was halved, making it comparable to the 6.9 µg/m3 concentration of the least polluted regions, “our results suggest this would lead to 82 fewer disease cases, 24 fewer hospital admissions and 19 fewer deaths, purely as a result of the change in pollution,” they write for The Conversation.
“What I was struck by was this really was a strong relationship,” coauthor Matthew Cole, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Birmingham in the UK, tells The Guardian. 
A previous preprint study in the United States found that just 1 µg/m3 more fine particulate matter in the air corresponded to 8 percent more COVID-19–related deaths. The new study found that in the Netherlands, for the same increase in fine particulates, the death rate was as much as 16 percent greater. The authors attribute the differences in the results to wide variances of population density within the US, which makes it difficult to average numbers across the country.
Previous analyses have examined a link between air pollution and COVID-19 in European countries and found a positive relationship between pollutants and death rate. This latest study on the Netherlands looked beyond the numbers themselves and more accurately corrected for spatial spillover, which previous studies have not done, including the proximity to international borders and the amount of traffic between countries, the locations of airports and the destinations they serve, and how coastal areas are shielded from many of those variables.
“As analyses of a possible link between air pollution and COVID-19 progress we are beginning to see much better studies emerge,” Frank Kelly, a professor at the school of public health at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study, tells The Guardian. “This new study appears to be the best to date.”
Contributors/-/UNIVERSITY OF LAUSANNE
As a medical student at the University of Zurich in the 1980s, Daniel E. Speiser was intrigued by how the immune system responds to infection, transplantation, and cancer, he recalls. After graduating, he trained in clinical medicine and experimental immunology. In the ensuing three decades, he has investigated the use of patient’s immune cells to fight cancer, and performed clinical trials testing novel cancer immunotherapies. One of his proudest research accomplishments, Speiser says, came in the 1990s, when he helped work out the mechanisms of how T cells destroy leukemia cells in patients treated with bone marrow from a donor. His findings led to more effective matching of patients and donors. The success of such transplants—which allow patients to generate immune cells that fight their leukemia—was “the first demonstration in the clinic that the immune system can control cancer highly effectively, and that was really fantastic to see,” he says. Leveraging the immune system against cancer has since become the basis of immunotherapy, which Speiser, now a professor at the University of Lausanne, seeks to improve with his more recent work on stem cell–like T cells and their practical importance in improving cancer therapies.

In his research, Speiser’s colleague Werner Held has focused on the body’s response to pathogens, and particularly what happens in infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, that cannot be controlled by the immune response. The immune system normally clears an infection and develops memory that enables it to more efficiently wipe out the pathogen if it encounters it again. In persistent infections, T cells have reduced activity, a phenomenon known as exhaustion, yet persist long-term. “One open question in the field of exhaustion was whether there was something like a memory in a chronic infection,” Held says. He and his colleagues were the first to discover a subpopulation of exhausted T cells with stem cell–like properties that continue to produce new cells programmed to fight a particular pathogen and thus sustain the immune response over time. He and Speiser, longtime colleagues at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and then at the University of Lausanne, teamed up for the first time to find that stem-like T cells are also present in tumors. They describe their work and how it could be used to improve immunotherapy in their feature story, “Harnessing Stem Cell–Like T Cells to Better Fight Cancer.”
BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE
Father and son Cliff and Matthew Dacso are seeking to understand the reach of the COVID-19 pandemic by zeroing in on its disproportionate effect on vulnerable communities such as people of color, incarcerated populations, and residents of nursing homes. This unevenness of COVID-19, and of other diseases, is especially prevalent in the US, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. “I work in Houston, Texas, where more than 20 percent of children do not have payment capability for healthcare,” says Cliff, a professor of molecular and cellular biology and medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “It’s an enormously impoverished state with regard to healthcare, and in the shadow of the world’s largest medical center, there are medical needs unmet.”

The Dacsos, along with coauthor Kara McArthur—who are all affiliated with the nonprofit Institute for Collaboration in Health—write about how “allostatic load,” which describes the economic, environmental, social, and other stressors that compromise biology, likely contributes to the COVID-19 pandemic’s oversized effect on underserved communities. “If you can really show the profound—not just social—influence, but the biological impact of these high-stress environments, there’s the potential to look at it as” a problem that can be ameliorated through social and political change as well as by applying therapeutic, preventive, and diagnostic advances, says Matthew, who is a physician and researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “With enough information about the biological facts, you’re able to start looking at the political interventions almost in the same way you’d look at a vaccine.”
While studying the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2 and how and why COVID-19 is spreading is paramount, the Dacsos say, looking at all the factors that contribute to the pandemic and its uneven impact, especially among people of color, might also help academic scientists branch out and forge connections with their surrounding communities. “Part of the benefit of addressing this from the biological basis is that it will force us all to engage with communities of color and disadvantaged populations, and it will get scientists out of the academic setting and hopefully into the community and bridge some of those gaps and create alliances that never existed before,” says Matthew. “Maybe that’s a bit of a pipe dream, but if we did it well and we did it right, that’s what would happen.”
How the Pharma Industry Pulled Off the Pivot to COVID-19/-/ABOVE: MODIFIED FROM © ISTOCK.COM, MARK KOLPAKOV
I
n mid-January, as cases of a mysterious illness climbed in China and began to appear in other parts of the world, Alex Zhavoronkov realized that this outbreak was becoming a major public health problem. As founder and chief executive officer of Insilico Medicine, a biotech startup based in Hong Kong—where measures to reduce the disease’s spread were already beginning to be put in place—he began to wonder what his company could do to help. 
Insilico had never tackled viral diseases before; the company’s focus was on noninfectious conditions such as cancer, immunological diseases, and fibrosis. But Zhavoronkov realized that Insilico’s approach, which applies artificial intelligence (AI) for rapid novel drug discovery, could help identify potential therapeutics to fight the virus we now know as SARS-CoV-2. 
Everyone, whether requested by the company prior­ities or just their own values, was willing to work endlessly around the clock.

Later that month, Zhavoronkov pitched the idea to his investors and colleagues. Some were concerned that pivoting to address the novel coronavirus might be a waste of resources. “They said, ‘Look, if you do this, we can’t spend too many resources, because it’s going to go away. It’s going to be like SARS,’” Zhavoronkov recalls. During the SARS epidemic of 2002–2003, a decade before he founded Insilico, there was a surge of interest in developing treatments and vaccines—but once the virus was contained, research interest and funding streams quickly dried up. Still, enough of the people he spoke with in January were convinced that this outbreak would be more serious, and they were willing to do something to help, even if it meant recouping costs later or not at all. (See sidebar, “Ensuring Global Access,” below) 
Quickly, the team got to work on repurposing their “generative chemistry platform,” which uses machine learning algorithms to design potential therapeutic molecules. Initially, the researchers focused on identifying inhibitors for a key SARS-CoV-2 protease based on the crystal structure of the enzyme. They’re now working with collaborators to synthesize these small molecules and test them against the virus in the lab. 
What started out as an outbreak in China has now spread to almost every nation in the world, infected millions of people, and killed hundreds of thousands. To deal with the global threat, numerous pharmaceutical and biotech companies have adapted their pipelines to COVID-19 over the last few months. There are now close to 400 compounds being evaluated as treatments or vaccines in various preclinical studies or clinical trials and more than 700 diagnostic tests either commercially available or in development. The need for rapid solutions has brought companies together, and has pushed researchers to work at breakneck speeds—often while dealing with complications brought about by lockdowns and social distancing measures. 
Companies set up pandemic pipelines
As the novel coronavirus spread around the globe, scientists at many pharmaceutical and biotech companies started to think about how to lend their expertise—either by identifying potential solutions within existing storehouses of compounds and technologies, or by applying research platforms and expertise to identify new ones. “I think everybody probably felt the urgent need to contribute,” says Dan Skovronsky, the chief scientific officer of the global pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly. “The question that many pharmaceutical companies had, including us, was: Where are our skills, capabilities, and knowledge, and how do we best apply them?”
For companies already focusing on virus-related diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines, the switch to COVID-19 was a natural one. Pfizer, for example, had been working on vaccines for various viral and bacterial infections long before COVID-19 emerged. In March, Pfizer announced a collaboration with the German company BioNTech to develop a vaccine. Within a few months, they’d launched clinical trials of their vaccine candidates in Germany and the US. 
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
John Kelly, the CEO of Atomo Diagnostics, an Australian startup company that developed a rapid blood test for HIV, says that his team decided to make the shift after getting several queries from diagnostics companies about whether their platform could support a test for COVID-19. The main challenge, Kelly says, was the sheer quantity of tests that they were asking for. “The numbers that these companies were talking about were significantly beyond our existing volumes.” 
We’re all asking ourselves: How do we continue to work this way, to bring this same sense of urgency and collaboration to other diseases?
 —Dan Skovronsky, Eli Lilly
For other companies, the shift to COVID-19 has meant delving into a new research area. Prior to the pandemic, for example, UK-based startup biotech Owlstone’s pipeline didn’t contain any virus-focused products. The company’s diagnostic tools, which are designed to identify specific chemical compounds in people’s breath, had been geared toward cancer detection and tracking the progression of conditions such as fatty liver disease. The pandemic got the team wondering whether SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets, could be detected with their technology. “We very quickly put together a team with a range of different academic clinical partners, along with others interested in breath research,” says Billy Boyle, Owlstone’s CEO. Within a matter of weeks, they had designed a clinical trial to test the technique and obtained the necessary approval from the UK’s Health Research Authority. That study is currently underway. 
Big pharmaceutical companies have also pivoted from their usual work. Before COVID-19 hit, therapeutics for infectious diseases had not been a focus for Lilly, says Skovronsky. But he and his colleagues realized there were certain areas—the development of therapeutic antibodies, for example—where their expertise could be applied to the pandemic. 
In March, Lilly joined with AbCellera, a biotech based in Vancouver, Canada. AbCellera already had a platform designed to rapidly develop medicines during pandemics, which it had established with a grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Scientists at AbCellera had obtained a blood sample from a recovered COVID-19 patient, and after running the sample through its platform—which rapidly screened for potential therapeutic antibodies using a combination of techniques, including high-throughput imaging, genomics, and AI—had identified more than 500 potential therapeutic molecules. The two companies launched a Phase 1 clinical trial of one of those antibodies in June. 
“[AbCellera] told us that they had this blood and were embarking on this project and said, ‘Is this something that you guys are interested in?’” Skovronsky says. “It took us about as long as it took to read the email to make the decision.” Within about a week, the two companies had signed a deal, with the goal of starting clinical trials of a new therapeutic within four months. 
People and resources adapt to new projects
The launch of new COVID-19 projects has required companies to quickly mobilize staff and resources. As a result, people involved in those projects have been working longer-than-usual hours. “The pace that we’ve had to work to fight COVID-19 is different than our normal course of work,” Skovronsky says. “I have many teams that meet every day, seven days a week.” 
Mikael Dolsten, the chief scientific officer of Pfizer global R&D, says the same has been true at his company. “This was the one occasion where I felt everyone, whether requested by the company priorities or just their own values, was willing to work endlessly around the clock,” Dolsten says. “I think everyone is inspired by the call to action to have a vaccine or treatment as fast as possible.” 
Many of the staff working on COVID-19 projects have been reshuffled from some of the hundreds of clinical trials that drug companies have been forced to put on hold due to the pandemic. In March, Lilly announced that the start of most new studies would be delayed and that new enrollment in ongoing studies would be halted. According to Skovronsky, many of the staff who would have been working on these trials were redeployed to work on the COVID-19 research instead. 
Other companies are shuffling staff around in a similar way. Owlstone’s Boyle says his company’s stalled trials freed some employees and resources to focus on COVID-19. “We’re trying to make sure that we can still deliver on those core programs,” he adds. “But [we’re] redeploying the resources into the specific areas of the COVID problem in the near term.”
All of this has to happen alongside measures put in place to contain the virus’s spread—culling the number of staff in the lab, for example, and sending home people who could do their job virtually. “Most of our laboratories are operating at the reduced scale because of the need for social distancing,” says Dolsten. “[In the labs], we have prioritized people at work on COVID-19 and certain lifesaving new medicines that are very close to coming to the clinic.” 
Companies have had to be flexible in other ways as well. Insilico usually synthesizes its compounds in Wuhan, China, for example, so when the lockdown started in that city, that part of their work was put on hold. “We just started synthesis in March,” Zhavoronkov says, adding that, as the epicenter of the pandemic has shifted, they’ve been able to restart work in Wuhan. “I think a lot of people who were using biotech services from China, when China went into lockdown, they started shifting to Europe and the US. Now it’s the other way around.” 
Companies seek collaborations to accelerate research
The pandemic has brought together people from many sectors—academia, industry, and government. “One of the wonderful things that’s happened during COVID-19 is that people are working together more so than I’ve ever seen,” says Gary Wilcox, the CEO of Cocrystal Pharma, a company working with scientists at Kansas State University to develop novel antiviral compounds to treat COVID-19. “Scientists don’t always join together in one great big group for the benefit of mankind. But here, there’s been a remarkable sharing of information.”
Some of these collaborations have been formalized as larger consortia made up of multiple companies, and in some cases also funding bodies and governmental agencies. “There’s been a really interesting pivot towards embracing open innovation and a willingness to team up with partners outside of the life science ecosystem,” says Angela Radcliffe, the research and development lead for life sciences at the consulting firm Capgemini. 
It is very tempting to profit from this, but I think for at least the very first steps, it is important to keep things open.
 —Alex Zhavoronkov, Insilico Med­icine
In March, several large pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Gilead, and AstraZeneca, formed a group called COVID R&D to share resources and expertise to try to accelerate the development of effective therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. That same month, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and Mastercard launched the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to bring researchers in industry and academia together to identify potential treatments. In April, the National Institutes of Health announced the launch of Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV), a partnership between federal researchers and 16 pharmaceutical companies to standardize the testing of therapeutics in both the lab and in clinical trials.
“There are still some companies out there who prefer to work in a more insular fashion, and that’s fine. But most of us are working together,” Skovronsky says. “I think there’s more to come, because if we have a successful drug or drug antibody, we’re going to have to work together in manufacturing it.” 
Whether the accelerated rate of drug and diagnostics development or the heightened level of cooperation among different players in the business will last beyond the pandemic remains to be seen. Company leaders are thinking about how to apply the lessons being learned now to expedite the development of therapeutics for other conditions as well. “We’re all asking ourselves: How do we continue to work this way, to bring this same sense of urgency and collaboration to bear against all the other diseases—Alzheimer’s disease and cancer and autoimmune diseases and diabetes—that we work on?” Skovronsky says. “Because those patients need it also.”
Ensuring Global Access
As pharmaceutical and biotech companies rush to bring COVID-19 tests and therapeutics to the market, they have also faced increasing pressure from advocacy groups, humanitarian organizations, and investors to ensure that their products will be broadly available. Some advocates have urged governments to override patents and asked companies to commit their intellectual property to the public domain. 
A handful of companies have announced plans to promote access to their products. For example, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson has promised that its effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with hundreds of millions of dollars from the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) will be a nonprofit endeavor—and that if and when a product is available, the company will work with health authorities to ensure global access. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, in addition to committing to donating 1.5 million doses of its experimental antiviral therapy remdesivir to the US government, signed deals with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and Pakistan to distribute the drug to 127 countries that “face significant obstacles to healthcare access.” 
Some companies are being more open with their intellectual property, too, at least at the early stages of research and development. Through initiatives such as the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, pharmaceutical companies including Eli Lilly have agreed to share proprietary libraries of molecular compounds for others to screen for potential COVID-19 therapeutics. These collections are shared “without worrying about [intellectual property] protection,” says Dan Skovronsky, the chief scientific officer of Eli Lilly. Insilco Medicine, although not a member of the Accelerator, has also released the molecular structures identified through its platform without patent protection, says the company’s founder and CEO, Alex Zhavoronkov. “Of course, it is very tempting to profit from this, but I think for at least the very first steps, it is important to keep things open,” he says. “Later, once we see that something works, we might be able to recover something.” 
Still, many companies, including Gilead, are retaining patents on COVID-19-related products. “We want to do the right thing from a humanitarian standpoint,” says Cocrystal Pharma’s CEO Gary Wilcox. “But we also have to recognize our shareholders, and our shareholders expect us to have a return on their investment. That’s where patents come in.” In February, Cocrystal obtained an exclusive license to develop coronavirus drug candidates identified and patented by researchers at Kansas State University. Patenting is “just a part of good science,” says Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten. “Without patents, this is not a sustainable ecosystem. Nobody would be able to afford to invest.”

he COVID-19 pandemic has probed and exposed gaping fissures in the global healthcare landscape. There have been dramatic failures in the capacity to care for the affected, in the ability to diagnose, in prevention, and in intervention. Among the many astounding observations about the pandemic and the world’s response to it has been the consistent differential effect of SARS-CoV-2 on different communities and populations.
In the United States, COVID-19 has been more widespread and injurious among people of color, particularly among African American and Latinx people. Epidemiologists made this observation soon after the virus’s introduction to the country, and the pattern has held up in metropolitan areas as diverse as Houston, New York City, and Seattle. Reports ascribe the difference to the higher prevalence of underlying disease such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease in these populations. That comfortable explanation, while true on its surface, does not go far enough to explain the disproportionate rates of infection.
Research inspired by epidemiologist Michael Marmot’s pioneering Whitehall studies of British civil servants from the 1960s and 1980s have consistently demonstrated a clear relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, independent of other risk factors, such as chronic disease or smoking. Thus, while the presence of chronic disease in disadvantaged populations is part of the reason for COVID-19’s unequal effect, other biological factors are likely also at play. “Allostatic load” is a useful construct to describe the cumulative effect of stressors affecting human biology. Introduced and developed by neuro-endocrinologist Bruce McEwen and physiological psychologist Eliot Stellar in 1993, allostatic load seeks to quantify the physiological effects of chronic stress. As the body attempts to maintain homeostasis in a stressful situation, its neuro-endocrine system releases elevated levels of certain hormones. Over time, these fluctuating and heightened cellular-level biochemical responses damage immune, cardiovascular, and other systems.
External stressors can come from degraded and inhospitable environments, pervasive violence, or constrained resources. Major life events such as illness and the death of a loved one contribute to allostatic load, as does personal trauma, both physical and psychological. Contrary to the old saw, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” the additive effect of social, economic, environmental, and disease stressors promotes vulnerability to disease and dysfunction. High allostatic load scores are consistently associated with increased all-cause mortality in adults. Individuals from lower-income communities, with higher allostatic loads, can reasonably be expected to have an impaired immune response to novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.
Research has suggested that a number of biochemical processes, and even the physiology of organs, can change as a consequence of socioeconomic stress. Animal models have homed in on specific features of biology responsive to persistent physical, psychological, and social stress, from the hippocampus in the brain to neuro-
endocrine and immune systems, and these provide insight into how socioeconomic status, as represented by increased allostatic load, can reverberate into susceptibility to infection among people.
For example, researchers studying rodents, pigs, and nonhuman primates consistently observe an immune defect resulting from persistent stress. Scientists have also reported defects in T cell functions and cytokine responses when animals’ normal social relationships are perturbed (See “The Isolated Brain” on page 32). Nonhuman primates consistently show markers of enhanced inflammation when under persistent social stress. At a neurohumoral level in several experimental models, persistent stress is associated with elevations in glucocorticoids and catecholamines that can modulate immune function.  
Likewise, very similar findings from human studies support this biological response to social stress. Some studies have even linked environmental exposures and health disparities with epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation. At the cellular level, stress is reflected in responses that lead to stress of the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn causes cell senescence and regulated cell death. This phenomenon can have distant, pernicious effects on physiological function.
Science is developing an understanding of how social and environmental stressors exert a significant and interconnected effect on both animal and human populations. These cumulative factors can lead to increased susceptibility to infection. In sum, social factors such as discrimination, lack of access to healthcare, and economic inequality increase allostatic load, in turn providing a convincing argument for a biological contribution to increased susceptibility to infection and worse outcomes among underresourced populations. Of course the higher prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases contributes to higher COVID-19 rates and worse outcomes in people of color, but the presence of chronic disease alone is not sufficient to explain the disparity. Furthermore, as allostatic load is a linking
factor in the prevalence of underlying disease in disadvantaged populations, the explanation for why people of color have increased susceptibility to the ravages of SARS-CoV-2 may be just as much related to the effect that social inequality has on biology as to the biology of chronic disease itself.
Emerging infectious threats thus propagate a cycle of vulnerability, due in large part to the complex interactions between epigenetics and the social determinants of health. A strong and humane public health strategy will take into account the entire life course and intergenerational issues, as well as directly contributing ecological and etiological factors. Failing to understand these propulsive factors in pandemics will condemn us to repeat this sad episode.

Why R0 Is Problematic for Predicting COVID-19 Spread/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, RCLASSENLAYOUTS
O
n the evening of December 30, 2019, an email with the subject line “undiagnosed pneumonia – China (Hubei)” popped into Maia Majumder’s inbox. The notice, which the computational epidemiologist had received through ProMED, a global reporting system for infectious diseases, went on to describe Chinese news reports of patients pouring into hospitals in Wuhan presenting with an unexplained respiratory illness. It added: “Citizens need not panic.” 
Majumder, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital who had previously helped predict the spread of Saudi Arabia’s MERS epidemic of 2014 and the West African Ebola outbreak shortly thereafter, agreed with that statement—at that point, it wasn’t clear whether the culprit was an infectious pathogen capable of jumping from one person to the next. But when murmurs of possible human-to-human transmission started to circulate a few weeks later, she and her Harvard colleague Kenneth Mandl set out to calculate a metric—the pathogen’s basic reproductive number (R0)—that would hint whether it could cause an epidemic.
It’s extremely difficult at the beginning of an epidemic to get an accurate R0.
 —Nelly Yatich, epidemiologist in Nairobi, Kenya
Simply explained, R0 represents the average number of people infected by one infectious individual. If R0 is larger than 1, the number of infected people will likely increase exponentially, and an epidemic could ensue. If R0 is less than 1, the outbreak is likely to peter out on its own. R0 alone cannot definitively forecast an outbreak, but “it’s like an early warning system, in a lot of ways, for the possibility of an epidemic or pandemic,” Majumder says. 
To estimate R0 for the coronavirus now known to the world as SARS-CoV-2, Majumder and Mandl picked a simple mathematical model that can infer the R0 from the curve of rising case numbers as well as another metric that describes how quickly an infection spreads from one person to the next, based on previous studies of MERS, another coronavirus infection. On January 23, they published one of the first estimates for the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 infection: 2.5, significantly higher than estimates for MERS but relatively similar to another relative, SARS, which caused a deadly global epidemic in 2003.
Within a week, five other research groups had produced their own R0 estimates, which all fell somewhere between 1.4 and 4, depending on the mathematical method they used and type of data they input. None were below 1. “It was a moment of realization for us where it was like, it definitely looks like we have something that can cause an epidemic on our hands, and this is probably not something that will just fizzle out on its own the way that we’ve seen with MERS outbreaks in the past,” Majumder recalls. 
Fast forward a month, and the world did have a pandemic on its hands. Modelers around the world scrambled to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes in their own countries and communities. Many epidemiologists were then and still are tasked by policymakers with answering urgent questions: How fast will it spread? How many hospital beds and ventilators will we need? When can we lift lockdowns and restart our economies again? Will we see a second wave? Will it be worse than the first?
Getting good estimates for R0 is key to answering such questions with accuracy. But R0 is notoriously tricky to nail down. It depends not only on the biological characteristics of a virus—which are a mystery at the beginning of an outbreak—but also on understanding how often people come into contact with one another. Faced with uncertainty, modelers have to make assumptions about the factors that determine human movement, which can limit the precision of their models and the accuracy of the predictions they generate. 
“R0 is a metric that is, first of all, poorly measured. And secondly, it’s informing models that result in public health action,” says Juan B. Gutiérrez, a mathematician at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “If we get it wrong, the public health action will be misplaced.” 
Defining R0 and tracking Re
With some notable exceptions, R0 forms a centerpiece in most disease forecasting models. The metric is often misconstrued as a fixed property of a pathogen, and it is indeed influenced by biological factors such as mode of transmission that stay more or less constant throughout an epidemic. But R0 also depends on how often people come into contact with one another, and that can differ drastically between countries, cities, or neighborhoods.
For COVID-19, “it is unlikely that the R0 that has been calculated in China will be the same in the US or in Europe,” explains Constantine Siettos, a biomathematician at the University of Naples in Italy. How many people one infected individual infects can also change within localities as governments close essential businesses and issue shelter-in-place orders, or begin to reopen the economy.
For that reason, epidemiologists typically distinguish between two forms of the reproductive number R: the basic reproductive number R0, which describes the initial spread of an infection in a completely susceptible population, and the effective reproductive number, Re, which captures transmission once a virus becomes more common and as public health measures are initiated. Re is typically much lower than R0. In the current pandemic, many policymakers are looking toward Re to gauge whether their policies reduce viral transmission, notes biomathematician Robert Smith? (the question mark is part of his name) of the University of Ottawa. “What you care about is, can we get the [Re] below one?” 
If the Re is even slightly above one—say around 1.1—then the outbreak could become too much for healthcare systems to handle, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted at a press conference in April. It was around this time that researchers at Germany’s Robert Koch Institute estimated that the nation’s Re for COVID-19 had dipped down to a safer value of 0.7, a finding that partly informed the government’s plan to begin relaxing lockdowns and reopening small businesses. 
While the flexible, context-dependent nature of Re makes it useful to politicians, the same characteristic also makes it difficult to measure. Because the factors that influence Re are always in flux, epidemiologists estimate the metric from models that simulate a pathogen’s spread through a population, based on often incomplete data on known cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. 
Epidemiological models are also used to calculate the initial R0, and they vary in their complexity and in the way they calculate the two metrics. At one end of the spectrum are simple models that infer these metrics from case data and some other measures; Majumder and Mandl used a model of this nature. The most popular types of model, however, are susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models, which assign everyone in a population to one of several categories: susceptible, infectious, recovered, or depending on the disease, also “exposed but not yet infectious” or “dead.” Equations describe the rates at which people move from one category to another, relying on parameters such as the contact rate, the probability of transmission, and the duration over which someone is infectious. At the other end of the spectrum are “agent-based” models, an innovative, complex breed of model simulates the movement of individuals. For both agent-based and SIR models, R0 and Re can be derived from the models themselves. Once calculated, these metrics can also play a key role within the models to create predictions about the spread of a disease. 
The final result, R, is a metric that varies depending on the context, the model used and its underlying assumptions, as well as the quality of data it is built with. Especially in the early days of an epidemic, when information on the basic biological properties of a virus and its transmission is uncertain, estimates can be off the mark, notes Nelly Yatich, an epidemiologist based in Nairobi, Kenya. “It’s extremely difficult at the beginning of an epidemic to get [an accurate R0].” 
What is R?
The reproductive number R describes the average number of individuals that a person infected with a particular pathogen infects. It depends on how that pathogen is transmitted as well as how often people come into contact with each other—factors that could vary depending on a pathogen’s strain and on the time and location of an outbreak. Scientists typically distinguish between R0, the basic reproductive number that describes disease transmission at the very beginning of an outbreak in a fully susceptible population, and Re, the effective reproductive number that describes transmission once measures such as social distancing or vaccination campaigns have been introduced. Re is typically much lower than R0.

Asymptomatic carriers influence R0 estimates
To estimate the biological parameters needed to determine R, such as the period over which an infected person can transmit a pathogen and the probability that she will do so, “we try to borrow information from similar viruses,” explains Sara Del Valle, a mathematical and computational epidemiologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. To model Brazil’s Zika virus epidemic in 2015, for example, her team used data on the transmissibility of dengue. During the 2011 H1N1 flu pandemic, they turned to data from influenza outbreaks in the 1960s. 
For COVID-19, Del Valle, like many other researchers, plugged in parameters documented for other coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, to estimate R0. However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 turned out to be markedly different from that of these viruses, notes Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a mathematical modeler focusing on infectious diseases at University College London and Oxford University. For instance, while MERS and SARS patients typically shed coronaviruses while symptomatic, studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be contagious even before patients know they’re sick. Such presymptomatic transmission means that the novel coronavirus’s infectious period is longer than that of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, throwing off early R0 estimates in Wuhan, which varied widely but tended to be lower than what some researchers now believe to be the case. “In fact, it seems like SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than MERS and SARS, so [R] is likely higher for SARS-CoV-2 than originally estimated.”
It’s even possible people who never show symptoms could play a role in spreading COVID-19. Asymptomatic transmission would also be in stark contrast to SARS and MERS, where asymptomatic carriers were relatively uncommon and were not thought to play a significant role in the outbreaks, notes Panovska-Griffiths. While early reports from China made little mention of possible asymptomatic individuals, studies elsewhere through March and April revealed significant numbers of individuals who tested positive for the virus but never developed so much as a cough. Around 43 percent of residents surveyed in the northeastern Italian town of Vo′ in February and March tested positive despite having no symptoms, and a recent review concluded that asymptomatic individuals could account for as many as 45 percent of infections. What’s more, some contact tracing data hint that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others, although it’s still a mystery how often that occurs. 
The realization that large numbers of “silent spreaders” could exist undermines the predictions of epidemiological models in several ways. First, high numbers of undetected cases would shrink infection fatality rates. Asymptomatic carriers could also transform the trajectory of an outbreak by accelerating transmission. But if they’re present in massive numbers—which many scientists consider highly unlikely—and they become immune after infection, local epidemics could be over much sooner than expected if the virus runs out of susceptible people to infect. Finally, silent spreaders could change estimates of R0 or Re. 
However, it’s not the numbers of asymptomatic people capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 per se that influences R0—as long as their proportion stays constant in the population, estimates of R0 won’t necessarily change. Rather, what matters is how infectious people are. For instance, if infected people who are asymptomatic have shorter or longer infectious periods than symptomatic individuals, or if their pattern of shedding the virus differs, that could alter the population-wide R0, explains Sang Woo Park, a PhD student who models infectious disease at Princeton University. Their contact rates also matter. If asymptomatic people come into contact with more people than symptomatic individuals because they don’t think they’re sick and therefore don’t self-isolate, currently used R0 values will undershoot reality, notes Ben Althouse of the Institute for Disease Modeling in Washington State. “Estimates made early on did not take into account the possibly quite high level of asymptomatic individuals,” and therefore likely underestimate R0, he says. Some researchers, including Gutiérrez, argue that R0 values as high as 13 best explain the virus’ rapid spread across the world before governments instituted social distancing policies.
Some clarity is starting to emerge from large-scale blood studies that scan for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2—telltale signs of a past infection—along with investigations into how infectious asymptomatic people are and for how long, Panovska-Griffiths notes. But problems with the accuracy of those tests will limit the value of the data they produce, and researchers will have to find new ways to account for those limitations in their models, Park adds. 
See “How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2”
In the meantime, epidemiologists are reckoning with the uncertainty around SARS-CoV-2’s biological parameters by assuming a range of values rather than fixed numbers, says University of Idaho epidemiologist Benjamin Ridenhour, who is helping state officials predict the spread of the virus. He’s placing confidence intervals around every biological parameter in his model. His R0 could be anywhere from around 1.3 to 4, he says. “That way, obviously the chances that anything you model is exactly correct are zero, but hopefully you can capture it in that range somewhere.”
MODELING AND R, THE REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER
Researchers across the world have developed countless epidemiological models to project the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of different public health policies on the spread of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Most, but not all, models being used today give the two versions of R—R0 and Re—a central role. The basic reproductive number R0 describes the spread of a disease at the beginning of an outbreak, and Re, an “effective” version of the metric, describes spread later on.
Statistical models
Statistical techniques can predict the likely trajectory of an outbreak based on observed data. For example, an early iteration of a model developed by the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which helped inform the White House’s response to the pandemic, works by characterizing the curve of death numbers in Wuhan and a number of European cities, and projecting those curves onto US data.

Relationship with R: Such models don’t typically use R, but are sometimes used to make quick estimates for R. 
Performance: Statistical techniques can be useful for making very short-term predictions, but they do not capture the dynamics of disease transmission or changing contact rates between people due to social distancing measures. Likely for these reasons, early predictions of the IHME model were off. As of early May, IHME has been using a new “hybrid” model that uses both statistical and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) modeling techniques.
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models
SIR models subdivide populations into compartments such as “susceptible,” “infectious,” or “recovered,” and sometimes other compartments such as “exposed but not yet infectious,” “asymptomatic,” or “dead.” Data on cases, hospitalizations, or deaths can inform estimations of the sizes of those compartments, and equations describe the speed at which people move from one compartment to the next.

Relationship with R: SIR models calculate R using several parameters, including the probability of infection, contact rate, and the period over which an individual is infectious. Once calculated, R helps determine how quickly susceptible people become infected, and thus shapes how fast a disease spreads across a population.
Performance: SIR-type models capture the fundamental dynamics of disease transmission and the effects of public health interventions, but they are often criticized for ignoring differences in contact rates across a population. More-refined SIR-type models, however, do account for varying contact rates, and some correctly predicted the fade-out of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan earlier this year.
Agent-based models
Agent-based models simulate individuals—or “agents”—interacting in various social settings and can estimate the spread of disease as these agents come into contact with others. Such simulations are often based on activity surveys, census data, de-identified mobile phone location data, and information from public transportation or airlines.

Relationship with R: Some researchers compute R separately and then plug it into their agent-based models, while others use these models to generate estimates of R and predict how R changes based on different interventions. In both cases, agent-based models typically calculate R per agent, unlike SIR-type models that calculate R over whole populations or demographics.
Performance: Several research groups prefer using agent-based models because they can simulate human behavior more accurately than SIR-type models and can predict how individuals’ decisions, such as staying at home, lead to collective or aggregate behavior, and thereby affect disease spread. However, such models require a lot of detailed data about human movement, and an enormous amount of computing power.

Contact rates are critical for nailing down R0
How many people one person comes into contact with can differ dramatically depending on their activities and the populations and structures of their towns and cities. It’s particularly important to account for this variation in the early days of an outbreak, when some infected people, often called “super spreaders,” transmit a disease to an exceptional number of others. While it’s possible that some people might have some phenotype that causes them to shed more virus than others, super spreading usually arises from the fact that some infected people come into contact with a lot of others, such as those living or working in elderly care homes and passengers and crew aboard cruise ships. Althouse says he prefers to talk about super-spreading “events” rather than individuals.
Research suggests that super-spreading episodes are in fact a normal feature of infectious disease outbreaks. Previous coronavirus epidemics were notorious for such events and some preprint studies are beginning to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Because people responsible for super spreading events have an exceptionally high individual R, they can inflate estimates of R0—the mean of a population—early in an outbreak. This variation makes it impossible to project the overall spread of disease just from R0 alone, notes Stockholm University mathematician Pieter Trapman. 
As the numbers of infected people grow over the course of an outbreak, the relative effect of individual outliers dwindles. But infected people still vary widely in how many others they infect, and capturing differences in contact rates remains important. Traditional SIR models are often criticized for not capturing that variation well, because they generally make the assumption that a population is evenly distributed, such that everyone’s R is the same. 
Majumder argues this is one reason why predictions from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) drastically overshot actual numbers of Ebola cases in West Africa in 2014. The agency’s SIR-type model assumed even mixing within the populations of Sierra Leone and Liberia. As a result, they posited the same R0 for everyone, when in reality only a small proportion of sick people infected many others. Most people didn’t infect anyone else at all. The model forecast more than half a million cases by January 2015, but thankfully, the outbreak was brought under control before it hit 25,000. 
Not many SIR models make this assumption, however. Ridenhour’s SIR-type model, for instance, accounts for differing contact rates across a population. For instance, he subdivided Idaho’s inhabitants into separate age groups and used published estimates on how often people of different ages come into contact with their own and other age groups to assign different contact rates to each group. Other researchers have structured the populations that inhabit their SIR models—not only by variables affecting contact rates such as the population density of their area, but also by factors that could affect health outcomes such as rates of comorbidities and employment. Although they’re still imperfect measures of reality, “the models often fit the disease dynamics pretty well,” Ridenhour says. 
Other researchers have started to build entirely different, “agent-based” models. These are designed to simulate the movement of individuals, or “agents,” in a population, and thereby predict how often they come into contact with one another. At Los Alamos, Del Valle and her colleagues are using supercomputers to construct an agent-based model for the US to understand how states can best relax lockdowns without risking a second wave of COVID-19. They’re using census data as well as other federal data describing the typical commutes of workers and transportation via planes and roads, and they’ll soon include location tracking data from mobile phone carriers for insights into when, where, and how people are traveling, according to Del Valle. With these considerations, “we have very detailed information about how [R] varies by county, by state, by age,” and with shelter-in-place restrictions.   
While SIR models are relatively simple and can produce results within hours, agent-based models can require an enormous amount of computing power to run, and detailed rules that characterize how agents can decide to move around and mix. If the decisions that agents make in one simulation don’t reflect reality, the whole model’s predictions may be off, explains Elizabeth Hunter, a computational modeler at the Technological University Dublin who is developing an agent-based model to understand the spread of the coronavirus in Ireland’s counties. That’s why she repeats her simulation more than 300 times, allowing agents to make different decisions with each iteration. In a model with more than 100,000 agents, this can take days, but in doing so, “you get that inherent stochasticity, which is what really happens in a real outbreak.” Hunter then averages the results of those model runs to create predictions. 
All models are wrong, but some are useful. You just hope you’re in the useful category.
 —Benjamin Ridenhour, University of Idaho
The choice of model to predict a virus’s spread ultimately comes down to preference. Some groups are employing both agent-based and SIR modeling techniques. Neither breed of model will produce completely accurate estimates for R0, Re, or any other prediction, Ridenhour notes. Despite unprecedented data sharing about the biology of SARS-CoV-2, uncertainties continue to pervade estimates of R0. Numerous groups are still producing different values for R0 and Re even in the same geographic regions, depending on the methods they’re using and the assumptions they’re making about the virus and the populations. R0 estimates in Wuhan range from 1.4 all the way up to 5.7, according to a recent retrospective analysis.
And despite modelers’ best efforts to simulate human social behavior, a single, average metric such as R ultimately says very little about how a disease is transmitted across a large population. Several modelers lament that some policymakers seem to be relying on estimates of Re to make decisions such as when to lift lockdowns and other social distancing measures. “Policies should not rely on Re alone due to uncertainty both in the actual cases in the total population, as well as in the assumptions of the mathematical . . . models that are used for its calculation,” the University of Naples’s Siettos explains in an email. 
These limitations have motivated some researchers, such as Althouse, to explore alternative metrics. In a preprint posted earlier this year, he and his colleagues propose that rather than using a mean value alone to describe the spread of disease, modelers should include information about how R0 and Re vary across a population. This can be estimated through detailed contact tracing studies, he explains. 
Other alternatives to R0 and Re have been proposed over the years, but they’ve never managed to overtake R0 and Re in popularity. R0 and Re are well-known metrics, they’re easy to interpret biologically, and ultimately, it’s difficult to break conventions that have been in place for decades, Smith? writes to The Scientist in an email. “I think it’s that R0 is simply too embedded in the ‘culture.’ Being such an old concept, it’s very hard to switch everyone to the same agreed-upon alternative.” 
But an alternative may have its own flaws, and no model or single metric will ever be able to fully capture the complexity of disease spread or make perfectly accurate predictions about it, says Ridenhour. After all, “all models are wrong, but some are useful,” he notes, citing a popular aphorism. “You just hope you’re in the useful category.” 
Opinion: Anticipating the Next Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PINKOMELET
T
here is still much science doesn’t know about COVID-19, and so it may seem the height of hubris to write a book about the pandemic now. But I just did—and in researching and writing COVID-19, I found we can largely answer several important questions already.
How did the pandemic start? SARS-CoV-2 most likely jumped to people from bats—a virus already able to infect and replicate in human cells. Could we have stopped the pandemic? Our best chance would have been to stop it before it started: we could have done far more to prevent humans from catching viruses from bats. It can be done. Bats in the US carry rabies, for example, but human cases are vanishingly rare because, left to their own devices, the two rarely encounter each other. 
Scientists have been warning of a zoonotic pandemic for decades. And many caution that there will be more of them. Their reasons for concern have not changed with the COVID-19 pandemic. Those reasons include human population increases that mean more people are penetrating wild ecosystems, where they encounter new animal infections; poor systems for early detection and containment of disease; and a lack of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic R&D for “emerging” diseases that do not yet constitute a sufficient market for such products. 
HACHETTE BOOKS, JUNE 2020
If we are to focus scientific attention on those problems, it might help to know what pathogens humanity may be up against. Virologist Dennis Carroll wants to find out. Until recently, Carroll ran emerging disease programs at the US Agency for International Development. These included a pathogen discovery program called PREDICT, which helped US and Chinese scientists identify and warn about the family of bat coronaviruses that includes SARS-CoV-2.
He now runs the Global Virome Project (GVP), which aims to sequence and map viruses harbored by animals that belong to families we know can infect humans. The idea is that the GVP’s sequences will help in developing antiviral drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics before pandemics start. Meanwhile, the search itself will help reduce the risk of pathogen spillover by establishing enhanced local capacity to monitor viruses in zoonosis “hotspots,” most of which occur in less-developed, tropical countries.
The cost of cataloging what Carroll calls “biological dark matter” will be about $3.7 billion over the next 10 years, but he told me that this is trivial compared to the cost of just this latest pandemic. GVP member Peter Daszak of the New York–based EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research organization collaborating on the PREDICT project, agrees. “We should find our plagues before they find us,” Daszak told me. 
Critics of the GVP argue that while sequencing thousands of viruses would be great science, such an effort won’t prevent the next pandemic unless we also know what those viruses do. “No amount of gene sequencing can tell us when or where the next outbreak will appear,” Andrew Rambaut of Edinburgh University in the UK told me. Better, he noted, to track novel infections in people.
Infectious diseases researcher Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins University agreed, noting that in 2013 virologists sequenced viruses similar to SARS-CoV that already possessed the ability to infect human airway cells, but that didn’t stop the COVID-19 pandemic. The real biological dark matter, he said, lies in many human infections, which clinicians tend to diagnose as “a cold” or “diarrhea,” with no effort to identify the pathogen. More precise tracking of which pathogens are actually infecting humans, he argues, might reveal impending trouble.
Both sides agree that whether viruses are tracked in animals or people, such monitoring would be best accomplished by a global network of local researchers studying their own backyards. David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine led the 2005 revision of the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations, which required countries to inform one another of outbreaks with the potential to spread internationally. The treaty’s requirement that rich countries help poor countries conduct their own disease monitoring is among its most important, he told me, but rich countries have neglected it.
Meanwhile, no amount of viral tracking will help if there is still a gap between scientific warnings and government action. The discovery of hundreds of bat viruses similar to SARS-CoV in 2005, and the further finding that some were already primed to infect humans seven years ago, should have spurred a renewed focus on coronavirus drugs and vaccines. It did not.
In the 1980s, scientists around the world organized to reach consensus positions on ozone depletion, then on climate change, which finally led to international treaties that aimed to address those global crises. We need such a scientific consensus now on viral threats, to present the risks to governments in a way that compels and directs action. Without that, it won’t matter whether we find our plagues before or after they have jumped to us: we still won’t be able to stop them.

How Social Isolation Affects the Brain/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PONOMARIOVA_MARIA

aisy Fancourt was at her home in Surrey in southeast England when the UK government formally announced a nationwide lockdown. Speaking in a televised address on March 23, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out a suite of measures designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, including closing public spaces and requiring people to stay home except for exercise and essential tasks. For Fancourt, an epidemiologist at University College London (UCL), the announcement meant more than just a change to her daily life. It was the starting gun for a huge study, weeks in the planning, that would investigate the effects of enforced isolation and other pandemic-associated changes on the British public.
We’re a social species. We really need others to survive.

In more normal times, Fancourt and her colleagues study how social factors such as isolation influence mental and physical health. Before Johnson’s late-March announcement, the team had been watching as Italy, and subsequently other countries in Europe, began closing down public spaces and enforcing restrictions on people’s movements. They realized it wouldn’t be long before the UK followed suit. “We felt we had to start immediately collecting data,” Fancourt says. She and her colleagues rapidly laid the groundwork for a study that would track some of the effects of lockdown in real time. Between March 24 and the middle of June, the study had recruited more than 70,000 participants to fill out weekly online surveys, and in some cases answer questions in telephone interviews, about wellbeing, mental health, and coping strategies.
This project and others like it underway in Australia, the United States, and elsewhere aim to complement a broader literature on how changes in people’s interactions with those around them influence their biology. Even before COVID-19 began its global spread, millions of people were already what researchers consider to be socially isolated—separated from society, with few personal relationships and little communication with the outside world. According to European Union statistics, more than 7 percent of residents say they meet up with friends or relatives less than once a year. Surveys in the UK, meanwhile, show that half a million people over the age of 60 usually spend every day alone.

These figures are concerning to public health experts, because scientific research has revealed a link between social isolation—along with negative emotions such as loneliness that often accompany it—and poor health. “We are seeing a really growing body of evidence,” says Fancourt, “that’s showing how isolation and loneliness are linked in with incidence of different types of disease [and] with premature mortality.” Alongside myriad connections to poor physical health, including obesity and cardiovascular problems, a range of possible effects on the human brain have now been documented: Social isolation is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, as well as mental health consequences such as depression and anxiety.
It’ll be years before researchers understand whether and how measures enacted during the pandemic play into any of these risks. The sort of isolation people are experiencing right now is unprecedented, and is compounded with other pressures, such as fear of disease and financial strain. But now more than ever, it’s important to study the effects of social isolation, and potential means to mitigate it, says Stephanie Cacioppo, a social neuroscientist and cognitive psychologist at the University of Chicago.  “We’re a social species,” she says. “We really need others to survive.”
The cognitive effects of prolonged social isolation
In 1972, French adventurer and scientist Michel Siffre famously shut himself in a cave in Texas for more than six months—what still clocks in as one of the longest self-isolation experiments in history. Meticulously documenting the effects on his mind over those 205 days, Siffre wrote that he could “barely string thoughts” together after a couple months. By the five-month mark, he was reportedly so desperate for company that he tried (unsuccessfully) to befriend a mouse.
This kind of experiment, and less extreme isolation periods such as those experienced by spaceship crews or scientists working in remote Antarctic research stations, has offered glimpses of some of the cognitive and mental effects of sensory and social deprivation. People routinely report confusion, changes in personality, and episodes of anxiety and depression. A crueler version of those experiments is continually underway in prisons across the world. In the US alone, tens of thousands of incarcerated people are in long-term solitary confinement, with devastating and lasting effects on cognitive and mental health. (See “Extreme Isolation” below.) 
For most of human society, however, social isolation acts in more insidious ways than these “experiments” capture, often disproportionately affecting vulnerable members of the population, such as the elderly, and with effects accumulating slowly such that they may go unnoticed for many years, if not decades. The effects of this subtler sort of social isolation, which some health researchers and psychologists have already described as a public health risk, are better observed in longer-term studies that look for links between a person’s social connections and how the mind functions. 
Many studies have found that chronic social isolation is indeed associated with cognitive decline, and that isolation often precedes decline by several years. One 2013 study, for example, measured cognitive function at two time points in a cohort of more than 6,000 older individuals taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). People who reported having fewer social contacts and activities at the beginning of the study, researchers found, showed greater decline in cognitive function, as measured by verbal fluency and memory recall tasks, after four years. 
More-recent studies have added weight to the association. A 2019 study of more than 11,000 people taking part in ELSA found that men who reported higher-than-average social isolation and women who reported increasing social isolation both experienced above-average decline in memory function within two years of being surveyed. However, the results don’t demonstrate that isolation causes deterioration in brain function, cautions ELSA director Andrew Steptoe, a UCL psychologist and epidemiologist who collaborates with Fancourt; it’s also possible that cognitive decline encourages some people to socialize less. 
THE ISOLATED BRAIN
Studies of animals and people experiencing isolation have identified several brain structures that appear to be affected by a lack of social interaction. Although these studies can’t identify causal relationships—and don’t always agree with one another—they shine a light on some of the mechanisms by which physical isolation, or feelings of loneliness, could impair brain function and cognition.

PREFRONTAL CORTEX: In some studies, people who are lonely have been found to have reduced brain volumes in the prefrontal cortex, a region important in decision making and social behavior, although other research suggests this relationship might be mediated by personality factors. Rodents that have been isolated from their conspecifics show dysregulated signaling in the prefrontal cortex.
HIPPOCAMPUS: People and other animals experiencing isolation may have smaller-than-normal hippocampi and reduced concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), both features associated with impaired learning and memory. Some studies indicate that levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which affects and is regulated by the hippocampus, are higher in isolated animals.
AMYGDALA: About a decade ago, researchers found a correlation between the size of a person’s social network and the volume of their amygdala, two almond-shaped brain areas associated with processing emotion. More-recent evidence suggests the amygdalae are smaller in people who are lonely.

Indeed, the relationship between isolation and cognitive health isn’t entirely clear-cut. A recent meta-analysis of more than 50 studies, carried out by clinical psychologist Linda Clare and colleagues at the University of Exeter, found that while there was reasonably good evidence for an association between social isolation and cognitive decline later in life, the relationship wasn’t as strong as that reported for cognitive decline and some other lifestyle factors such as educational attainment. “We have to acknowledge that there are lots of different measures used and different studies and different ways of approaching this,” says Clare, whose work focuses on ways to help dementia patients and their caregivers in the UK. Different studies assess social isolation and cognition differently, and not all research takes into account potential confounding factors such as isolated people’s frequency of leisure activities, or their participation in voluntary or paid work. Despite all the variability, Clare says, “we did see that there is a reasonably robust association between more engagement in social activity and better cognitive function in later life.”
To add to the challenges in understanding these complex relationships, there’s sometimes confusion in the scientific literature about the distinction between objective and subjective measures of isolation, notes Cacioppo. “We know that there’s a difference between being physically isolated and emotionally isolated,” she says. Not everyone with limited social connections feels lonely, and some people with lots of social connections do. Cacioppo adds that while some people might choose solitude without suffering particularly adverse effects, loneliness is an inherently negative emotion, and when experienced for long periods, is often associated with depressive symptoms. “Loneliness is a discrepancy between what you want and what you have” in your relationships, she says.

A number of studies have tried to parse these subtleties by measuring social isolation and loneliness in parallel, partly aided by a metric known as the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness scale. This scale, developed by UCLA researchers in the 1970s, uses a list of statements to evaluate how connected people feel, in contrast to measures of social isolation, which rely on more-objective measures of social network size or the frequency of contacts with other people. One recent longitudinal study in England found that social isolation and loneliness were each associated with poorer physical and mental health, and the strongest association was seen in the group of people who reported both conditions. A three-year study of adults in Spain published in 2019, meanwhile, found that loneliness and social isolation were independently associated with cognitive decline. Other work has found effects for only one of the two measures: Studies in the Netherlands and the UK, for example, have found that loneliness, but not social isolation, was predictive of the onset of dementia. In contrast to these findings, a preprint published on bioRxiv a few months ago reported that social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated with elevated dementia risk among more than 150,000 adults in the UK when genetic risk factors for dementia were taken into account.
“It’s quite a varied picture,” says Steptoe. “One sometimes finds different patterns.”
Possible mechanisms linking isolation to brain function
By the time the nine-person crew of the Antarctic research station Neumayer III emerged from their 14-month stay a couple of years ago, they’d endured winter temperatures of -50 °C, drastic changes in natural light, and prolonged lack of contact with the outside world. The effects on their brains, it turned out, were substantial. 
Structural MRI performed by neuroscientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development before and after the trip showed anatomical changes to the dentate gyrus, a region of the brain that feeds information into the hippocampus and is associated with learning and memory; the crew members’ dentate gyruses had shrunk by an average of around 7 percent. The crew members also had reduced blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein involved in stress regulation and memory, and they performed worse on tests of spatial awareness and attention than they had before they left.
The participants in this study were contending with more than just social isolation during their expedition, making it hard to know whether the observed brain changes are linked to lack of social contact as opposed to circadian disruption or some other aspect of their experience. But researchers studying social isolation and loneliness in the general population are also beginning to document differences in brain structure that could help reveal biological mechanisms at play. (See illustration above.) 
Surveys already suggest that many people have felt increasing loneliness since the pandemic began.
Sandra Düzel, a neurobiologist at the same Max Planck Institute (though not a collaborator on the Antarctic study), recently set out to study such differences in more than 300 people participating in a longitudinal project called the Berlin Aging Study. Using MRI to map the volume of the brain’s various regions, Düzel and her colleagues found that, regardless of their level of social contact, people who scored high on the UCLA loneliness scale tended to have smaller gray matter volumes in a handful of regions. Those areas included the hippocampus and the amygdala, known for its role in emotion processing. The findings don’t demonstrate that loneliness causes shrinkage of these brain structures, Düzel writes in an email to The Scientist, but the researchers are considering both a lack of social stimulation and loneliness-induced stress as possible contributing factors.
Recent research in mice, which, like humans, are social organisms, supports a role for social interaction in maintaining normal brain structure and function, and hints at possible molecular mechanisms. One 2018 study, for example, investigated the effects of social isolation on mice’s ability to recognize other individuals—something researchers assess by recording how long mice spend interacting with one another, as an unfamiliar mouse normally elicits more interest than a familiar one. Adult mice that had been kept in isolation for up to a week were worse at discriminating familiar and unfamiliar mice, the researchers found. Returning mice to enclosures containing their colony mates restored their recognition abilities, as did inhibiting a small signaling protein known as Rac1, which has been linked to memory problems in Alzheimer’s disease. Activating Rac1 in mice that had not been isolated caused the animals to show the same forgetfulness exhibited by isolated individuals.
While distinguishing between loneliness and social isolation is impossible in animal studies, these kind of manipulative experiments offer a unique insight into effects of isolation on the brain, says Moriel Zelikowsky, a neuroscientist at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Mouse work she carried out while a postdoc at Caltech, for example, revealed a previously unknown role for Tac2, a signaling neuropeptide implicated in diverse cognitive functions, in mediating the behavioral effects of isolation.
© ISTOCK.COM, MARIA ZAMCHY 
The peptide was highly expressed across broad regions of the brain in mice that had been housed alone for several weeks, the team found, but not in controls kept with two other mice, nor in rodents isolated for just 24 hours. Mice that had spent weeks by themselves also displayed aggression—a typical behavioral effect of isolation—but that behavior was inhibited by a drug that blocks the protein receptor that Tac2 normally binds to. The findings suggest that Tac2 may be involved in regulating some of the effects of long-term isolation, rather than immediate stress induced by separation from companions, Zelikowsky notes. She adds, however, that there’s still a lot about the neuropeptide the team doesn’t know, including how it may interact with hormones involved in the stress response and whether it functions the same way in humans.
One area where animal studies and observational research in humans may be starting to align is the link between isolation and inflammation—a response that can have negative effects on cognitive function as well as on other processes throughout the body. For example, more than a decade of animal work has shown increased circulation of inflammatory signaling molecules such as interleukin-6 in isolated mice, and a recent meta-analysis of more than two dozen human-focused papers on the topic noted that studies of people experiencing loneliness consistently reported increased blood concentrations of this same cytokine. The meta-analysis also found that social isolation was primarily linked to higher levels for C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, two molecules involved in inflammatory responses in mice and humans.
Fancourt, a coauthor of one of the studies included in that meta-analysis, says that the picture starting to emerge from this line of research is that social isolation and loneliness have distinct but closely related effects on inflammatory responses. Her study found that social isolation was associated with higher levels of CRP and fibrinogen, while loneliness was associated with lower insulin-like growth factor-1, a molecule that helps inhibit inflammation. “Both isolation and loneliness were linked to inflammation,” she says, “but while social isolation was linked to inflammatory markers themselves, for loneliness it was related to a pathway that involved how much those inflammatory responses are allowed to happen, or are inhibited from happening.”
If we’re all putting in lots of extra effort to speak to people, are we able to offset some of the negative effects of isolation?
 —Daisy Fancourt, University College London
Like research on any potential health risk, studies of social isolation still struggle to connect the dots between observations and concrete biological outcomes. Human studies can only reveal correlations, and experimental animal research “can show you that pathways can work in principle, but it doesn’t show they operate like that” in practice, says Steptoe. Nevertheless, research so far has helped to flesh out neuroscientists’ understanding of the sorts of factors involved in responses to social isolation—and, perhaps more importantly, has inspired several efforts to mitigate the problems that such isolation may cause.
Protecting cognition in socially isolated people
In recognition of the potential risks of social isolation, whether they be related to brain health or to other, less direct risks of living alone, many countries and health organizations have funded outreach campaigns to improve connections between people most likely to be (or to feel) isolated and the rest of the community. Cohousing organizations in the US and elsewhere, meanwhile, aim to foster social engagement with shared living spaces, although their ability to reduce loneliness has yet to be evaluated.
Where changes in a person’s social life or living arrangement aren’t possible or are unlikely to improve the situation, some researchers argue that pharmacological treatments could help—at least temporarily. Cacioppo and her late husband John, a pioneer in the study of loneliness and social neuroscience, proposed a few years ago that allopregnanolone, a steroid involved in regulation of BDNF as well as various emotional and behavioral responses to stress, might help alleviate loneliness in humans. Since 2017, Cacioppo’s team has been working with lonely patients to test a closely related molecule, pregnanolone, although the work has had to be put on hold because of the pandemic.

Zelikowsky notes that osanetant, the drug that she and her colleagues used to block Tac2 receptors in their mouse experiments, may also have promise as a therapeutic for people experiencing chronic isolation. The drug was originally developed in the 1990s by France-based pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Synthélabo (now Sanofi) as a treatment for schizophrenia, but was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, she says, adding she doesn’t know of clinical work currently underway to investigate its potential for people experiencing isolation or loneliness.
Other researchers, meanwhile, are focusing on behavioral interventions that may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and other effects associated with social isolation. Fancourt and Steptoe, for example, have shown that boosting cognitive engagement, regardless of a person’s social engagement, may have a protective effect. One recent study found that people who more frequently visited museums, galleries, or exhibitions or attended theater performances, concerts, or operas were less likely to show decreases in memory recall and verbal skills within the next decade. (The relationship didn’t hold for visits to the cinema.) A 2019 study by the same researchers suggests that engaging in these kinds of cultural activities is associated with a lower risk of dementia.
It’s this kind of area in which research from the ongoing pandemic might also really contribute, says Fancourt. During the crisis, millions of people have found themselves isolated without choosing to be that way, and surveys already suggest that many people—particularly women, according to one recent study in the UK—have felt increasing loneliness since the pandemic began. 
While some people may appreciate the chance to be alone, others have found new ways to stay connected with their social network—behaviors that could provide critical information about how different people cope with the effects of being physically separated from society. For example, Fancourt says, “if we’re all putting in lots of extra effort to speak to people, have Skype calls, Zoom calls, message people, are we able to offset some of the negative effects of isolation?” 
From a research perspective, she adds, it’s an unprecedented opportunity to ask new questions about how a lack of traditional social contact influences human biology. “It might really change the way we think about concepts like loneliness and isolation,” Fancourt says, “and mean that we might actually start to define and research them differently based on what this very unusual natural experiment teaches us.” 
Extreme Isolation
Every year in the US, tens of thousands of incarcerated people spend weeks or months at a time alone in small windowless cells, deprived of sensory stimuli and separated from other people. Surveys of people who have experienced this form of extreme isolation point to a range of negative cognitive consequences, including difficulties thinking or remembering information, obsessive thinking, and hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, as well as longer-term mental illness risks, and increased incidence of suicide. Research on these effects of solitary confinement isn’t new; in the 19th century, observers of incarcerated people began attributing high rates of psychotic illnesses to having been housed alone and deprived of sensory stimulation, while work carried out in the last few decades in countries including Canada, Norway, South Africa, and Switzerland have drawn similar conclusions. 
Animal studies that try to mimic the conditions of solitary confinement, meanwhile, indicate numerous potential biological effects on the brain. Studies of mice, for example, show that the stress induced by prolonged isolation can cause changes in brain structure, including reduced hippocampal volume, plus changes in the expression of genes associated with neuroplasticity and chemical signaling. 
Neuroscientists face an uphill battle in using this research in legal settings for people who have experienced solitary confinement. Many US courts have rejected evidence of psychological pain on the grounds that, unlike a diagnosed mental illness or physiological harm, it is insufficient evidence of “cruel and unusual punishment,” and therefore doesn’t count as a violation of the US Constitution. Neurobiological research based on animal studies, meanwhile, has been rejected on the grounds that animal-based studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. That said, a landmark settlement between incarcerated people and the governor of California in 2015 was decided partly on the basis on neuroscientific evidence and resulted in the end of indeterminate solitary confinement in the state’s prisons.
Autopsies Indicate Blood Clots Are Lethal in COVID-19/-/ABOVE: A blood clot under the microscope

n mid-March, pathologist Sigurd Lax pulled on a water-repellant surgery coat, a surgical cap, special booties to cover his shoes, a respiratory mask, and two pairs of gloves, then walked into an operating room at Hospital Graz II in Austria. There before him lay a patient who died of COVID-19 only 48 hours earlier. 
“COVID-19 is a new disease, and we really want to know what’s underlying it,” Lax says. There’s only one method to determine what causes illness and death. “It’s doing an autopsy.”
Methodically, Lax sliced into the patient, taking care not to spray any bodily fluids into the air. He’d waited two days to perform the autopsy to reduce the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. With little known about the illness at the time, he and his colleagues wanted to take extra precautions to avoid getting sick. Waiting 48 hours after death to perform the autopsy, however, didn’t rid the body of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
“We don’t know if the virus is still infectious,” Lax says, but finding its genetic material lingering in the patient’s tissues prompted him to be even more cautious. This autopsy was the first of 11 he and his colleagues have performed on patients who died from COVID-19. In May, the pathologists’ published a paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine reporting what they’d found.
Lax, a professor of pathology at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, spoke with The Scientist about the results and what they reveal about possible therapeutics for COVID-19.
Sigurd Lax
COURTESY OF JOHANNES KEPLER UNIVERSITY LINZ
The Scientist: As you started performing these autopsies, what was most striking in terms of damage done to the body?
Sigurd Lax: Both lungs were symmetrically damaged, with damage to the alveoli, the tiny air sacs of the lungs. The pleurae, the double-lined membranes, surrounding the lungs showed very little inflammatory changes, a little fluid. Most cases had a strongly dilated heart, but the abdomen was not really involved. That was what we saw at first view.
TS: In your paper, you write that patients had blood clots in their small to mid-sized pulmonary arteries. What’s the significance of this finding?
SL: We saw an occlusion of multiple pulmonary arteries, usually in the periphery. There were some clots in the larger branches, but we think seeing more of them in the periphery means the clots are thrombotic rather than embolic. [Editor’s note: thrombotic clots develop in a blood vessel where there is damage, in this case in the lungs, while embolic clots form elsewhere, in a blood vessel in the leg, for example, and travel through body and become lodged in blood vessels of the lung.] And this concurs also with findings in pediatric cases, where you have occlusion of arteries in the fingers, for example, or necrosis in back, so in the skin on their back. So it’s not the pulmonary embolism which is the major cause of severe illness but the inflammation of the blood vessels and a change in the clotting system of the blood. And this causes occlusion of the pulmonary arteries, which increases the pressure of pulmonary circulation and then leads to an insufficiency of the heart to pump blood through the body properly.
TS: Does the virus cause the blood clots to form or is it the immune response to the virus that causes them?
SL: So far that’s not clear. I think one can speculate that either one or the other or both may be the reason, but I think it might be more the immune response, that inflammatory mechanisms lead to the thrombosis.
See “Neutrophil Extracellular Traps May Augur Severe COVID-19”
TS: When doing the autopsies, did you focus mainly on the lungs or were there other body regions that you also examined, such as the brain?
SL: In the first cases we only looked at the brain in one case, but we’ve done more autopsies since the paper came out and from those, the central nervous system doesn’t seem to be really specifically affected, at least grossly. I don’t have so far any microscopic data, but the analysis is ongoing.
TS: There have been reports that infection with SARS-CoV-2 could cause diabetes by leading to damage of insulin-producing cells. Was there any indication of that in the autopsies? 
SL: Not really. I think there’s a coincidence with diabetes. I think that has to do with the vascular changes caused by diabetes.  . . . These patients due to their diabetes have atherosclerosis, then they have heart disease, and this aggravates the course of these COVID-19–associated pulmonary changes because, you know, when you have a strong heart, you will be able to overcome the infection, but if you have some associated disease, particularly heart diseases, you will undergo cardiac failure.
TS: What do your results say, right now, about treating COVID-19 patients with a severe form of the disease?
SL: Right after being admitted to the hospital, ten out of our eleven patients received an anticoagulant at a prophylactic level to prevent clotting in the blood. We did not find thrombosis in the deep arteries of the pelvis and the deep blood vessels of the pelvis and upper legs, but the treatment was not enough to prevent thrombosis in the pulmonary arteries. 
TS: Given the autopsy data and all of the information researchers are gathering on COVID-19, what are the biggest questions that have yet to be answered? 
SL: What we really don’t know at the moment is how the virus goes through the body, what are the sequence of changes caused by the virus. That’s not completely solved.

SARS-CoV-2 Can Infect Human Brain Organoids/-/ABOVE: A brain organoid cultured from human stem cells in which some cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Viral protein is stained red, and neuron nuclei labeled in blue.

ith no ideal animal model that mimics how SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to COVID-19 in people, several research groups are turning to mini-organs grown from human stem cells to better understand whether and how different organs could become potential targets of infection.
In a preliminary, not-yet-peer-reviewed study posted June 26 to bioRxiv, a team of Yale University researchers report that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting and replicating in neurons in human brain organoid models. While the finding is consistent with two other, smaller studies, there’s no clear evidence so far that the virus can infect brains.
“I think these [organoid] papers are interesting, but it’s too early to know how to put [them] in context of the rest of the infection,” says Avindra Nath, a neurovirologist at the National Institutes of Health who wasn’t involved in the research.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that COVID-19 causes not only respiratory ailments, but also a wide variety of neurological symptoms—from the common phenomenon of losing taste and smell, to more recent reports of ischemic stroke, delirium, and hallucinations—raising questions of whether such symptoms are a byproduct of various disruptions SARS-CoV-2 causes throughout the body, a consequence of the trauma of being hospitalized with COVID-19, or if they could be due to viral invasion of neural tissues. Earlier this year, Eric Song, a graduate student in immunologist Akiko Iwasaki’s lab at Yale, and PhD student Ce Zhang started to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 was capable of infecting neurons of the central nervous system.
I definitely don’t want people to start panicking and thinking that this is a brain infection . . . there’s no proof for that.
—Akiko Iwasaki, Yale University
The team used nine-week old brain organoid models—blobs of tissue that in this case formed a simplified version of the community of neurons that inhabits the cerebrum—which had been grown from induced pluripotent stem cells. When the tissue was exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus readily infected increasing numbers of cells over the course of four days, suggesting that the coronavirus can use the machinery of neurons to generate more copies of itself. “I wasn’t surprised to see that [the] neurons do become infected,” Iwasaki says, “but I was a bit surprised to see how efficiently they [became] infected.”
The team also observed large numbers of cells dying within the organoid, yet curiously, those often weren’t the same cells that were infected, suggesting that infected cells damage their neighbors, possibly by gulping up oxygen from the environment in the process of manufacturing copies of the virus, Iwasaki says. Interestingly, an analysis of transcribed genes in the coronavirus-infected organoids pointed to an upregulation of pathways related to cell division and metabolic processes—a contrast to Zika virus–infected organoids, which primarily upregulate inflammatory pathways. “This virus surprises me [at] every turn, because it doesn’t produce the typical set of . . . gene signatures that we’re used to seeing with other viruses,” Iwasaki says.
See “Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV”
An important question to the team was whether SARS-CoV-2 was using its typical route of entry—via the ACE2 receptor—into human cells, given previous reports suggesting that mRNA abundance of ACE2 is very low in brain tissue. Although Iwasaki and her colleagues found that ACE2 mRNA was indeed sparse within the organoid neurons, they found widespread ACE2 protein on the surfaces of certain neurons. Perhaps, she explains, it’s a protein that requires very little mRNA to manufacture, such that transcript levels aren’t a good indicator of protein abundance.
In addition, the researchers found they could block viral infection by administering an ACE2-blocking antibody to the culture, suggesting that even in brain tissue, the receptor “can be used by the virus to enter the cell,” Iwasaki says.
“This is an excellent study . . . really comprehensive and addressed a lot of questions,” remarks Lena Smirnova, a neurotoxicologist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved in the research. She sees the results as a validation of her own findings, recently published as a short communication in Alternatives to Animal Experimentation, in which she and her colleagues also observed replication of SARS-CoV-2 in some neurons in a type of human stem-cell derived organoid called a BrainSphere.
Such organoid studies have limitations, Smirnova notes. For example, they lack microglia cells, which may play some role in antiviral defense. In addition, neural organoids lack the blood-brain barrier that would normally confer some degree of protection against most viruses, although Iwasaki notes it’s possible that SARS-CoV-2 could circumvent this barrier by entering the brain through the olfactory system, something that’s been shown in mice infected with common cold–causing coronaviruses.

If infection of the brain can feasibly occur in some people, it’s certainly not common, Nath stresses. Some examinations of autopsied brains from COVID-19 patients have discovered only low levels of viral RNA transcripts, and one preliminary study reported the presence of viral protein, but none so far have found evidence of replicating virus. In Nath’s own unpublished studies of autopsied COVID-19 brains, “we haven’t found any infection either,” he says.
For Nath, the takeaway from the Yale study is that when ACE2 is present at the levels at which it’s expressed in human organoid models, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting neurons and hijacking their protein production machinery to replicate. However, whether this can occur in healthy human brains depends on the extent of ACE2 expression there. Nath’s interpretation of the literature is that neither ACE2 mRNA nor protein are produced at high enough levels and across enough brain regions to allow for coronavirus invasion.
See “Receptors for SARS-CoV-2 Present in Wide Variety of Human Cells”
The high levels of ACE2 protein Iwasaki’s team observed in organoids could perhaps be an artifact of the organoid system, Nath suggests. It’s possible that ACE2 expression could be induced in brain neurons under specific and likely rare pathological circumstances, such as severe inflammation, he speculates. “The final verdict may not be entirely out, but [the capacity to invade and thrive in neural tissue] certainly isn’t a major issue with this virus.” Neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients could be explained by persistent immune reactions that could somehow impair neurological function, he adds.
Smirnova and Iwasaki, however, note several reports suggesting some ACE2 protein in certain patches of the human brain, as well as evidence of coronavirus genetic material inside brain neurons of patients who died during the SARS epidemic in China in the early 2000s, indicating that the original SARS virus could infect brain cells. Scientists don’t yet have a detailed idea of the role of ACE2 in the central nervous system, Smirnova notes in an email to The Scientist. “More detailed analysis is needed to figure out what cells are expressing it and the level of expression.”
Iwasaki agrees that if brain infection can occur in COVID-19, it would only affect a subset of patients. “I definitely don’t want people to start panicking and thinking that this is a brain infection, causing brain infection in everybody . . . there’s no proof for that,” she says. “It’s sort of a proof-of-concept study, to demonstrate that the brain can become infected, but whether it is and to what extent, and what disease it causes in humans—that requires further studies.”

Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19/-/ABOVE: A new test from Columbia University analyzes saliva for genetic traces of SARS-CoV-2 using LAMP. Samples that contain viral RNA change color from red to yellow.

aced with an ongoing lack of protective equipment and testing supplies, medical professionals have been seeking alternatives to accurately diagnose cases of COVID-19, a pandemic that has caused more than 11 million cases and more than 530,000 deaths worldwide. Supplies of nasopharyngeal swabs were some of the first testing materials to run low in mid-March, prompting a pivot to nasal swabs. More recently, saliva-based testing has come forward as an attractive, low-cost alternative.
The first spit tests are already being sold to consumers, with more poised to apply for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon. While saliva can be a crude sample for diagnosing disease using traditional PCR, it pairs well with a cheap PCR alternative known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), previously used to detect outbreaks of Zika and Ebola in resource-poor countries. Propelled by a global pandemic, researchers in the US and the UK are now modifying LAMP and assessing its utility as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19.
“By diversifying the possible choice of assay, you diversify the supply chain as well,” says Robert Meagher, a chemical engineer at the Sandia National Laboratories who develops tools for diagnosing emerging diseases. Making additional testing options available to healthcare workers will help mitigate backlogs if one reagent or material runs low. 
You get your housing information, your dining card, your ID card, and you also submit your saliva sample.
—Martin Burke, University of Illinois
Saliva-based testing also offers an improvement over the standard nasopharyngeal swab because people can collect their own samples with minimal discomfort—simply spit into a sterile tube and mail it to a lab for processing. And due to an emergency use authorization given to Rutgers University in May, some tests can now be carried out by patients in their own homes, allowing personnel and protective equipment to be saved for when they are most needed. Andrew Brooks, the director of technology development at RUCDR Infinite Biologics, the Rutgers-affiliated biorepository that developed the test, says the use of in-home testing “completely mitigates the risk of contracting the disease while you’re getting a test,” and requires only gloves. 
Several companies are selling Rutgers’s kits directly to consumers through online orders, although all tests must be sent back to its lab in New Jersey for processing. Positive results are reported to local health officials, and individuals are advised on how to respond.
Universities and clinicians alike are now planning to incorporate saliva-based sampling into their workflow for diagnosing COVID-19. The UK government recently partnered with the molecular diagnostics company Optigene to develop a pilot study involving more than 14,000 people to test the efficacy of its saliva test. In the US, the University of Chicago will use spit tests to clear patients prior to elective surgeries in its hospital for the next several years, Evgeny Izumchenko, a UChicago oncologist who helped develop the university’s test, tells The Scientist.
In another screening application, University of Illinois chemist Martin Burke laid out plans to use a new test designed by himself and colleagues on more than 50,000 students as they return to campus in the fall. “We imagine this will be just part of their orientation,” Burke said during a webinar on June 16. “So you get your housing information, your dining card, your ID card, and you also submit your saliva sample.” 
Despite the ease of sampling, saliva is not without its challenges. For PCR, the virus’s RNA must first be reverse transcribed into DNA, and saliva contains enzymes that chew up nucleic acids and inhibitors that interfere with the DNA amplification process used to detect the virus. As a result, saliva must often be purified before the DNA can be amplified. “It’s kind of a dogma . . . that you have to start with absolutely pure DNA or RNA,” Meagher says.
LAMP in the spotlight
While quantitative reverse transcription PCR remains the most-used method to diagnose COVID-19 regardless of how the sample is collected, many of the bottlenecks in the pipeline stem from the high cost and low scalability of the approach, says Meagher. A single benchtop thermal cycler, the machine that controls the temperature changes during the PCR, typically costs around $25,000 and can usually only run between 96 and 384 samples at a time.
To address these challenges, a team of researchers at Columbia University recently modified a LAMP protocol used by their fertility clinic to identify abnormalities in chromosome numbers in human embryos. Rather than count chromosomes, the tool now detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva in as little as half an hour, changing the color of the sample from red to yellow when the virus is present.
“For the COVID-19 pandemic, it was really felt that the big challenge is to try to get the test out to where it’s needed,” says Zev Williams, a reproductive endocrinologist who helped develop the test. “Perfectly accurate tests that take days to come back with results and can only be given to a small number of patients are not sufficient to address the problem.”
The team’s new test is one of several using LAMP. Unlike PCR, which creates new copies of DNA through cyclical temperature changes, LAMP reactions take place at a consistent 63°C, eliminating the need for complex machinery. The chemicals used in the reaction are also more robust against the enzymes and inhibitors in saliva, doing away with the need to purify each sample.
If this test becomes available . . . many of us will acquire and test it. If it works out as they say, that could be a wonderful addition.
—Alan Wells, University of Pittsburgh
“Very early on, [LAMP] was recognized as something that would have applications for pathogen detection,” says Meagher, who has himself used LAMP to study Zika and Ebola. “You have the potential for a greatly simplified ‘sample in–answer out’ kind of assay, which is much harder to achieve with PCR.” 
LAMP has traditionally been deployed in resource poor countries because it requires less power and equipment than PCR. But under the current pandemic, the whole world has become somewhat resource limited, and Meagher stresses that LAMP can be just as useful in diagnosing emerging diseases in first-world nations such as the US. During Florida’s Zika outbreak in 2016, diagnostic tests could sometimes take as long as eight weeks to process, Meagher says, and “a technique like LAMP would have made a huge difference in the United States as well.”
See “Quick and Cheap Zika Detection”
A report detailing Williams’s modified LAMP assay, published June 16 on the preprint server medRxiv, describe a “high-performance LAMP” with 1,000 times the sensitivity of a standard LAMP assay, capable of detecting a single copy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in as little as one microliter of saliva. When compared to other methods such as RT-quantitative PCR, Williams says, the new LAMP assay can sometimes be even more sensitive.
Williams envisions his test being used to conduct mass screenings at airports, offices, and schools to identify even asymptomatic patients with a low viral load. “It’s not the person who’s sick and in the hospital” who needs treatment, he stresses. “We need to treat the person who’s well and riding the subway and transmitting it.” The team is currently applying for emergency use authorization.
Alan Wells, the medical director of the University of Pittsburgh’s UPMC Clinical Laboratories, expressed skepticism that any LAMP assay could be as sensitive as traditional PCR. “While they could be as sensitive in theory, in practice I have yet to see it,” Wells tells The Scientist, adding that LAMP assays are inherently less efficient at amplifying DNA than PCR is. “If this test becomes available . . . many of us will acquire and test it. If it works out as they say, that could be a wonderful addition.”
While Williams’s paper has not yet undergone peer review, it is far from the only research suggesting that LAMP may be as sensitive as PCR-based methods. Several projects have already begun processing samples using LAMP. The pilot study in England, for example, is using its own LAMP protocol, and researchers at Beaumont Health, Michigan’s largest healthcare system, have also announced a new LAMP test for processing saliva samples.  
“I have never felt so much stress or pressure in my life,” Brooks says, adding that he has frequently worked 22-hour days in the last four months to bring his spit test to market. “We’ve all taken it to another level because of its importance. I hope we never see anything like it in our lifetime again.”
Dozens More Cases of Neurological Problems in COVID-19 Reported  /-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, STOCKDEVIL

ewly described case reports add to growing evidence that COVID-19 infections can result in severe, long-lasting neurological complications—including inflammation, psychosis, delirium, nerve damage, and strokes—even among patients experiencing mild cases of the virus with few other symptoms. In some instances, the new study claims, these neurological effects were the first manifestation of the disease.
In a paper published today (July 8) in the journal Brain, neurologists in the UK noted an uptick this spring in cases of a potentially fatal condition called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). While ADEM is usually diagnosed in younger children after a viral infection, researchers at the college’s Institute of Neurology tell The Guardian that they saw two or three cases per week among coronavirus patients during April and May. Ordinarily, the hospital sees about two ADEM cases per month among adults.
“We’re seeing things in the way Covid-19 affects the brain that we haven’t seen before with other viruses,” says Michael Zandi, a consulting neurologist at the university’s hospital and the study’s senior author. “What we’ve seen with some of these Adem patients, and in other patients, is you can have severe neurology, you can be quite sick, but actually have trivial lung disease,” he adds.
See “Lost Smell and Taste Hint COVID-19 Can Target the Nervous System”
COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease that attacks the lungs, but it has also manifested seemingly unrelated symptoms, such as a loss of taste and smell or memory loss, that can persist for months beyond the initial diagnosis. These oddities suggest a neurological source. 
The study detailed the neurological symptoms of 43 patients hospitalized in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. A dozen were diagnosed with inflammation of the central nervous system, including nine cases of ADEM. A further 10 patients experienced delirium or psychosis. Eight patients suffered strokes, including one that was fatal, and another eight had peripheral nerve damage. 
At least two patients also developed strange behaviors shortly after being discharged from the hospital. One woman, as described in the paper, repeatedly donned and took off her coat, and began hallucinating lions and monkeys inside her home. Another woman became drowsy and ultimately needed emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain.
The full long-term effects of these symptoms may not be realized for years, says Zandi. Many patients are currently too sick to place inside brain scanners, The Guardian reports, meaning the full extent of neurological symptoms remains unknown. In addition, some changes may be more subtle and happen over time. Speaking to Reuters, Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist at Western University who was not involved in the study, expressed concern over their potential to severely affect the quality of life for recovering patients.
“My worry is that we have millions of people with COVID-19 now. And if in a year’s time we have 10 million recovered people, and those people have cognitive deficits . . . then that’s going to affect their ability to work and their ability to go about activities of daily living,” Owen says.
See “Severe Neurological Ailments Reported in COVID-19 Patients”
His worry has precedent, as evidenced by the 1918 influenza pandemic that infected one-third of the world’s population. In the decades after, up to 1 million people developed a brain disorder called encephalitis lethargica, known more commonly as “sleepy sickness.” Some scholars have linked the two events together, although the evidence remains inconclusive.
“Whether we will see an epidemic on a large scale of brain damage linked to the pandemic—perhaps similar to the encephalitis lethargica outbreak in the 1920s and 1930s after the 1918 influenza pandemic—remains to be seen,” Zandi tells Reuters.
The authors of the study are now pushing for larger, possibly global efforts to track neurological symptoms. Zandi tells The Guardian that health professionals should begin incorporating cognitive function into their patient assessments, while his coauthor Ross Paterson, a neurodegenerative specialist at University College London, says early diagnosis is key. “Given that the disease has only been around for a matter of months, we might not yet know what long-term damage COVID-19 can cause,” Paterson tells Reuters. “Doctors need to be aware of possible neurological effects, as early diagnosis can improve patient outcomes.”
How Face Masks Can Help Prevent the Spread of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PIXELFIT
F
ace masks have been a matter of intense debate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, several government officials and health authorities were discouraging healthy people from wearing masks—noting that there was little evidence for the practice’s ability to prevent spread among the general public and citing concerns that protective face coverings, which were desperately needed by healthcare workers, were in short supply. Gradually, however, governments began to either require or recommend that their citizens wear face masks in public. In June, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended widespread mask-use as a way to prevent coronavirus transmission. One model estimates that if at least 95 percent of people wear masks in public between June and October, approximately 33,000 deaths could be avoided in the US. 
There are three broad categories of face coverings: tight-fitting masks known as N95 respirators that are designed to filter out both aerosols (often defined as particles that are smaller than 5 micrometers in diameter) and larger airborne droplets, loose-fitting surgical masks that are fluid resistant and capable of filtering out the bigger particles, and cloth masks, which vary widely based on how they’re made.
Different Types of Masks

N95 respirator: Tight-fitting single-use masks typically made with synthetic materials such as polyester and polypropylene. These masks are able to filter out at least 95 percent of both large airborne droplets and aerosols.
Surgical/medical masks: Loose-fitting single-use masks made with three or more layers of synthetic materials. These can filter out large airborne particles, but some aerosols can leak through, and particle-containing air is able to flow around the edges. 
Fabric masks: These often-homemade masks vary widely in their construction and effectiveness. Aerosols are likely to leak through, and particle-containing air is able to flow around the edges. With appropriate washing or a couple of days to decontaminate, fabric masks are reusable.

A growing body of research supports the use of all three types of masks, though the quality of evidence varies. One of the most comprehensive examinations to date, published in The Lancet in early June, systemically assessed 172 observational studies—mostly conducted in healthcare settings—looking at the effect of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and two related coronaviruses. The results revealed that N95 respirators provided 96 percent protection from infection and surgical masks (or comparable reusable masks made with 12 to 16 layers of cotton or gauze) were 67 percent protective. 
While research on cloth masks is much more limited, one group of researchers demonstrated that, in the lab, multilayer masks made of hybrid materials (cotton and silk, for example) could filter up to 90 percent of particles between 300 nanometers and 6 micrometers in size. However, it’s important to note this is only the case when there are no gaps around the edges of the mask, which are often present when people wear cloth or surgical masks. Indeed, the researchers’ findings suggest that gaps around any mask can reduce filtration by 60 percent or more. Still, scientists using computational models have reported that, in general, widespread use of facemasks, when combined with lockdowns, may help prevent future waves of infection.
“We’re recommending that N95s still be primarily saved for the healthcare situation,” says Kirsten Koehler, a professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. “For individuals in the public, wearing a fabric mask is probably still the way to go.”
None of these masks are going to be perfect, especially against the aerosols.
—Kirsten Koehler, Johns Hopkins University
There are several factors, including the number of layers and type of material they are made from, that contribute to how effective a mask will be, explains Raina MacIntrye, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Australia. According to the WHO, fabric masks should ideally have at least three layers: an inner layer made with absorbent material (e.g., cotton), an outer layer with water-resistant material (e.g., polyester), and a middle layer (made with absorbent or water-resistant material) to act as a filter. In addition, MacIntrye adds, “the design should fit around the edges of the face because air will flow down the path of least resistance.” In other words, if there are gaps on the sides of your mask, your breath will slip through those cracks instead of being filtered through the mask itself. 
Although evidence is building to support the use of masks to stem the coronavirus’ spread, many questions remain, such as whether the coronavirus spreads through aerosols or just through larger respiratory droplets. There is also little research on the efficacy of face masks, particularly cloth ones, in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in community settings, Julii Brainard, a senior research associate at Norwich Medical School in the UK, tells The Scientist in an email. 
Amidst the uncertainty, what is clear is that mask wearing is not the only action people should take to slow the spread of COVID-19, Koehler says. “None of these masks are going to be perfect, especially against the aerosols. You want to continue to encourage people to work from home, avoid being crowds—things like that are going to work, regardless of how good your mask is.”

US Bars International Students from Online-Only Learning in Fall/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LYUBOV IVANOVA
Update (July 14): The Harvard Crimson reports that DHS and ICE have rescinded the policy that would bar international students from taking online-only classes during the fall semester.
Update (July 8): The Harvard Crimson reports that in response to ICE's announcement, Harvard and MIT have sued the Department of Homeland Security and ICE because the decision to force in-person instruction for international students was made, as the suit alleges, “notwithstanding the universities’ judgment that it is neither safe nor educationally advisable to do so.”
S
ince higher education institutions ended in-person classes in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty over what classes will look like in the fall. Universities will soon have to come up with an answer. On Monday (July 6), the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that international students would not be able to take online-only courses and retain their student visas without attending some in-person instruction, and universities have to declare their plans to the government by next week.
Having a restriction on international students and online classes isn’t new: the students are traditionally restricted from taking more than three credit hours online per semester. But that was before the global COVID-19 pandemic forced universities to cancel in-person instruction and move instruction online. This temporary final rule states that students during the fall 2020 semester may take more online courses than before, but there still has to be some in-person instruction. If those options aren’t available at their institutions, they are expected to “[transfer] to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status” and could be subject to removal, per the document. 
Some people online were quick to speak out against this decision, calling it discrimination and questioning ICE’s motivation for making this decision in the middle of uncertain times, rather than offering leniency. According to ICE, the agency is providing flexibility during this pandemic, and as school is about to begin and they have “a concordant need to resume the carefully balanced protections implemented by federal regulations,” according to the announcement.
“There’s absolutely no reason for this underlying rule,” Allen Orr, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, tells Inside Higher Ed. “What is the issue? They are paying tuition, they are enrolled in the school program, they’re doing the exact same thing their counterpart students are doing.”
Times Higher Education reports that organizations such as the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) are critical of the measure and have released statements asking for leniency during this crisis. 
See “The Pandemic’s Effects on Recruiting International STEM Trainees”
Some scientists have taken to Twitter, where ICE’s decision is referred to as #StudentBan, to voice their concerns and even brainstorm ways around the regulation. 
“Maybe we can get around this lunacy by providing a single, 1 credit, half-hour, in-person class to international students that is a discussion about their rights and about how much the school benefits from them,” tweeted Prosanta Chakrabarty, a professor of ichthyology at Louisiana State University. “Teach it once in the football stadium and don’t take attendance.”
Casey Boyle, an associate professor of rhetoric and writing and the director of the Digital Writing & Research Lab at the University of Texas at Austin tweeted: “I’m not sure how many international students there are at my university, but I’m prepared to teach up to 5,000 in-person independent study courses over the next year.”
In addition to the pressure this mandate is putting on students, universities are required to respond to ICE by July 15 with their intentions to have classes in-person, online, or as a hybrid. 
“The guidance is unworkable and deeply harmful,” Craig Lindwarm, vice president of governmental affairs for the APLU, tells The Washington Post.
Researchers from All Over the World Pitch In to Fight COVID-19/-/F
rom engineers in Colombia to virologists in India, researchers worldwide have come up with ways to contribute their expertise to the effort against COVID-19. Click on an entry in the table below to learn more about a particular project.
1. LOW-COST VENTILATORS: Many hospitals in low- and middle-income countries lack adequate supplies of ventilators for severe COVID-19 cases but can’t afford buy more of the machines, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each. Engineers in Colombia have designed low-cost equivalents, and will soon be testing their performance in coronavirus patients.
2. WASTEWATER SCREENING TOOLS: Wastewater epidemiology—specifically, the idea of looking to sewage to detect and quantify infections in local populations—has become a popular approach for tracking the pandemic. A team in the UK is working on a simple, paper-based device that could be used onsite at wastewater treatment plants. 
3. VOLUNTEER NETWORK: As businesses and universities across Europe began shutting down in a bid to slow the COVID-19 pandemic, three animal behavior researchers talked about how they wished they could do something to combat the disease. Their online initiative, Crowdfight COVID-19, has since matched hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 projects with people who can help.
4. HOMEGROWN COVID-19 TEST: On March 18, hours before giving birth to a baby girl, virologist Minal Dakhave Bhosale submitted her team’s COVID-19 diagnostic test for validation by India’s National Institute of Virology. The country can now produce hundreds of thousands of those tests every week, and is also exporting them to neighboring countries.
Colombian Engineers’ Ventilators to Be Tested in COVID Patients/-/ABOVE: Engineers at University of La Sabana have put their prototype ventilator, which costs less than $3,000 to build, through a series of tests.

n March, as Colombia’s coronavirus cases were taking off, officials there selected a number of hospitals in the country to look after COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care. The University of La Sabana Teaching Hospital in the small city of Chía just outside Bogotá was to take in patients from across the Cundinamarca region, a patch of Andean plateau with nearly 3 million inhabitants. But the hospital only had 25 ventilators—hardly enough for the hundreds of patients expected to become so sick they’d need mechanical aid to breathe.
With no affordable ventilator options on the market, the vice president of University of La Sabana turned to Julian Echeverry and his colleagues in the institution’s mechanical engineering department, asking if they could make a few hundred ventilators from scratch. “Obviously we are able to do it—we are mechanical engineers,” Echeverry, the director of mechanical engineering, recalls answering.
At its core, a ventilator is a simple machine, blowing oxygen-rich air into a body and removing carbon dioxide–loaded exhalations.
But when the team of five got to work trying to reverse-engineer one of the hospital’s ventilators, they quickly realized that building a dependable replicate of the biomechanical instrument wasn’t a trivial task. The robots and vehicles that the group was used to making were easy enough to repair if they broke. But if a ventilator had even a minute imperfection, a patient’s lungs could rupture. “We had to change everything in our thought process because we knew that everything had to be extremely reliable,” Echeverry says. “People could die if we made mistakes. That was different from anything that we had done before.”
Fast forward three months, and the team had produced a working prototype that could ventilate a sedated pig. It costs less than $3,000 to make—a fraction of the usual price tag, which can reach into tens of thousands of dollars. But the researchers still have to clear the hurdle of demonstrating that the machines can keep real patients alive.
Echeverry’s group is one of dozens in low- and middle-income countries racing to build low-cost, emergency replacements for the standard-of-care ventilators that have been already bought up or given unattainable price tags thanks to bidding wars between wealthy nations. If projects such as Echeverry’s succeed, they could not only save lives, but also improve ventilator design more generally and empower local communities by proving that “you don’t need to be a Philips or some billion-dollar company to make them,” notes Daniel Kraft, a Silicon Valley–based biomedical entrepreneur and chair of Exponential Medicine, an annual medical conference.
At its core, a ventilator is a simple machine, blowing oxygen-rich air into a body and removing carbon dioxide–loaded exhalations. The challenge for engineers such as Echeverry is to ensure that it does that job consistently, and can precisely measure the volume, pressure, and timing of the breaths passing through a patient. If the air pressure entering a patient’s lungs is too low, her lungs could partially collapse and oxygen levels could drop dangerously, and if it’s too high, “you could literally blow a hole in the lung,” notes James Frank, who directs the pulmonary and critical care fellowship training program at the University of San Francisco, California. This need for precision in the parts of the ventilator that sense air volume, pressure, and other factors is in part what makes the machines so expensive.  
Echeverry and his colleagues decided to make their own mechanical sensor to measure the amount of air being passed into a patient—something that proved to be their biggest challenge, although eventually the researchers figured out a way to do it, Echeverry says.
Industrias Médicas Sampedro, a Colombia-based company that makes implants for trauma surgery, launched several of its own ventilator-building projects in March. Mauricio Toro, the CEO of TECHFIT Digital Surgery, a Florida-based branch of the company, says that he and his colleagues were able to cut costs by sourcing ventilator components locally. In a collaboration involving three different teams—one led by TECHFIT and its parent company, and two spearheaded by local universities—Toro and his colleagues have created three different prototypes designed to be built primarily with parts made by Colombian manufacturers, although some components, such as pressure-controlling, corrosion-resistant oxygen valves, which undergo extensive safety testing, still had to be imported.
Like University of La Sabana’s prototype, Toro’s three models have passed their first test: keeping a sedated pig alive for several hours while the animal couldn’t breathe on its own. Both teams aim to connect their ventilators to human patients in the coming weeks. Echeverry’s group, which just received the green light to start testing, plans on ventilating five human COVID-19 patients, alternating every four hours with a commercial ventilator that will be on standby the whole time should anything go wrong with the team’s prototype.
Toro is working with Colombia’s medical device regulatory body, INVIMA, to develop a trial for human testing. He says he already has 100 ventilators ready should the pandemic spiral out of control before Toro has a chance to properly test the devices—an emergency situation for which regulatory authorities would approve of the devices’ use. “We sincerely hope that we are not needed and that the health system of the country is able to cope with the pandemic,” he says. “But in case it gets overrun, we’re happy to be there.”
There are dozens of similar projects underway across Colombia.
Although the devices have yet to be tested in people, Frank says he’s impressed with all of the designs so far. Referring specifically to one of Toro’s models, he notes that, “compared to a modern ventilator that’s been tested and approved by our country’s FDA, I would be a little bit more worried about it, but its ingenuity, its low cost, and its attention to most of the key details that give clinicians concern make me think that it’s a pretty good design.”
However, the simplicity of some of these low-cost ventilators may come with some trade-offs, Frank notes. Standard-of-care ICU ventilators allow for patients’ own lungs to do some of the breathing as well, adjusting the amount of air they put into the patient accordingly. That kind of dynamic functionality is challenging for Echeverry’s ventilator, for example, which would require sedating patients so the machine could take full control over the breathing process. That, however, makes it harder for doctors to evaluate patients’ clinical progress.
Another point to remember is that ventilators alone aren’t enough to prepare an ICU ward for a pandemic, Kraft notes; that would require access to sufficient sedative medications, anesthesiologists, as well as personnel trained to operate the devices. To address part of this issue, Toro launched a training program for hospital staff learning to use his ventilator models.
The TECHFIT and University of La Sabana groups are the furthest along with their designs, but there are dozens of similar projects underway across Colombia, which gives Echeverry hope that the country will escape severe ventilator shortages. “Every single city in Colombia was able to develop a big project around [building] ventilators,” he says. “We are actually very proud of Colombian engineering.”

n an open letter published today (July 6), 239 scientists from 32 countries urge the World Health Organization and other bodies to address the potential for airborne transmission of the coronavirus. The authors write that a growing body of evidence suggests “beyond any reasonable doubt” that the virus spreads indoors through tiny aerosols—a finding that should be reflected in the WHO’s recommendations.
The perceived distinction between respiratory droplets and aerosols dates back to experiments carried out in the 1930s. WF Wells, a sanitary scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, suggested that coughs and sneezes produce two types of droplets: large droplets that fall quickly to the floor under their own weight, and smaller aerosolized droplets capable of circulating in the air for long periods of time.
As The New York Times notes, if airborne transmission is a significant factor in the COVID-19 pandemic, this would have significant implications for containment efforts, which might require such measures as greater use of N95 masks among healthcare workers and modifications to ventilation systems. However, the WHO maintains that SARS-CoV-2 primarily leaves the body in the larger droplets, which then settle onto nearby surfaces. For this reason, the WHO has emphasized hand-washing even as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now downplays the likelihood of picking up the virus from contaminated surfaces. Similarly, the WHO lagged behind its member nations in promoting mask-wearing for members of the public.
Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHO’s technical lead on infection control, tells the Times that the evidence for the virus spreading by air remains unconvincing. “Especially in the last couple of months, we have been stating several times that we consider airborne transmission as possible but certainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence,” she says.
The letter, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, comes after a series of outbreaks that cannot be explained through surface-based infection alone. Circulating air was implicated when 1,500 staff fell ill at a German slaughterhouse, and a superspreader event was linked to a single person who infected 52 fellow choir members. In that case, the Times reports, the act of singing may have generated the tiny aerosols necessary to spread the virus around the room.
So far, scientists have been unable to consistently culture viral particles pulled from the air, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that viruses in aerosols are incapable of causing infection. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, tells The Washington Post that while it’s relatively easy to find viruses on surfaces, identifying and culturing airborne viruses remains “a major technical challenge.”
See “Droplets from Speech Can Float in Air for Eight Minutes: Study”
Some critics see WHO’s stance on airborne transmission as symptomatic of a larger problem with the speed at which it weighs new evidence and incorporates it into recommendations. “WHO’s credibility is being undermined through a steady drip-drip of confusing messages, including asymptomatic spread, the use of masks, and now airborne transmission,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who has previously advised the organization, tells the Post. “The public, and even scientists, will lose full confidence in WHO without clearer technical guidance.”
The authors of the open letter call on the medical community and relevant national and international bodies to acknowledge the role of airborne transmission in spreading COVID-19 and take appropriate preventative measures.
Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary healthcare at the University of Oxford, echoes calls in the letter to adopt what is known as a “needs and values” approach, also known as the precautionary principle, to account for the fluidity of knowledge around the pandemic. With this approach, organizations assume a worst-case scenario, and draw from common sense practices to recommend protective measures accordingly.
“There is no incontrovertible proof that SARS-CoV-2 travels or is transmitted significantly by aerosols, but there is absolutely no evidence that it’s not,” Greenhalgh tells the Times. “At the moment we have to make a decision in the face of uncertainty, and my goodness, it’s going to be a disastrous decision if we get it wrong. Why not just mask up for a few weeks, just in case?”
But the needs and values approach can place an undue burden on smaller hospitals or on lower-income countries, which would be forced under revised guidelines to redirect already-strained resources—toward greater use of N95 masks, for example—in the absence of absolute proof. 
“That’s the balance that an organization like the WHO has to achieve,” Paul Hunter, a member of the WHO’s infection prevention committee, tells the Times. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to say, ‘We’ve got to follow the precautionary principle,’ and ignore the opportunity costs of that.”
Chief WHO scientist Soumya Swaminathan tells the Times her staff members are working tirelessly to evaluate new scientific evidence as fast as possible. And even among the WHO’s critics, many have praised the organization’s willingness to continue to field questions related to the pandemic during daily press briefings. “We take it seriously when journalists or scientists or anyone challenges us and say we can do better than this,” Swaminathan says. “We definitely want to do better.”

Researchers Seek a Simple, Rapid Test for SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ANTIKAINEN

s SARS-CoV-2 was spreading through his home country of China early this year, biomedical engineer Zhugen Yang realized that his expertise in both sensory technology and wastewater monitoring could be the perfect combination for helping to track COVID-19 outbreaks. Yang had previously created field-ready diagnostic assays for pathogens in bodily fluids (cow and human). He had also helped develop sensors for monitoring wastewater—initially for cocaine and methamphetamine, and then for sequences of human mitochondrial DNA, which can serve as biomarkers for various cancers. Now at Cranfield University in the UK, Yang decided he would develop an easy-to-use, low-cost test to check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at wastewater treatment plants.
In recent months, wastewater epidemiology—specifically, the idea of looking to sewage to detect and quantify infections in local populations—has become a popular approach for tracking the pandemic. Several studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2, while rarely released in urine, is shed in the stool of about one-third to one-half of infected individuals, particularly during the first few days of infection, says Mariana Matus, CEO and cofounder of Biobot, a Boston-based company focused on wastewater epidemiology that has begun testing samples weekly from hundreds of wastewater treatment plants across the US for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Several countries are now organizing widespread screening programs for traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 
We don’t see them necessarily as a replacement of the laboratory work.
—Mariana Matus, Biobot
See “Countries Begin Large-Scale Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage”
Existing methods involve sending samples to labs, where trained researchers perform the gold-standard technique, the resource- and time-intensive method of quantitative PCR (qPCR), to detect the virus’s genetic material. Yang set his sights on something simpler. His approach, described in an opinion in Environmental Science & Technology in March, should be able to yield a sample within an hour without any power or advanced facilities, he says.
The assay Yang envisions, an adaptation of one he and colleagues developed a couple of years ago for identifying sexually transmitted bovine pathogens in cow semen, will involve several steps. First, a user would run a wastewater sample through a filter to remove large particles, before pipetting or dropping the water onto a membrane that retains anything bigger than 50 nanometers across—including SARS-CoV-2, which has a diameter of at least that. 
Researchers use paper-based devices such as these to detect pathogens.
ZHUGEN YANG 
The user then adds chemicals to release nucleic acids harbored within viruses and organisms on the membrane and transfers the resulting solution to a folding, paper-based device that absorbs those nucleic acids thanks to embedded glass fibers, which generate an electrostatic pull. Finally, the user rinses the genetic material from the paper into a small plastic chamber and adds reagents to amplify SARS-CoV-2’s RNA. If the virus is present, amplification of those sequences triggers a reaction that causes a color change visible on the outside of the plastic chamber.
Such a test would give workers at wastewater treatment plants the ability to perform the tests onsite, and so avoids the need for cold storage and shipment of the samples, as well as the inherent delays in such a process. Yang’s not the only one interested in such an approach. Matus says her company is working with several partners to see if sensors for SARS-CoV-2 that were first developed for clinical COVID-19 testing could work for monitoring sewage for signs of the virus. 
“Given the huge demand for analyzing wastewater, we’re beginning to explore how the technology can be used in that context,” says Matus. For the traditional qPCR testing Biobot is currently using, the turnaround time is typically about three days, she says. “The opportunity that I see with rapid testing, paper-based strips or other [technologies], is . . . almost like a prescreening of the wastewater samples. We don’t see them necessarily as a replacement of the laboratory work, but used in combination, it can provide a more holistic service for a treatment plan, because now [wastewater treatment plants] will be in control of testing, ideally every day.” 
Pilar Domingo-Calap, a virologist at the University of Valencia in Spain, raises concerns about the sensitivity of an onsite testing protocol, particularly one that lacks a robust filtration step to remove bacteria and other biological material from the wastewater sample before analysis of the genetic material it contains. She says she wonders if such a test would be able to pick up trace amounts of viral RNA amongst the loads of other biological material in wastewater. For her and her colleagues, who are currently analyzing wastewater samples from more than 20 Spanish towns, sensitivity of the test will be critical. Right now, she notes, because only a small fraction of Spain’s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, “you need a big city with lots of people to really know what is happening” based on samples of sewage.
Matus doesn’t share Domingo-Calap’s concerns about the lack of filtration, however. “Detection can still happen in the absence of filtration,” she says, but adds that “it will be interesting to understand how to boost detection in that very raw sample. . . . That’s our main concern with the technology: sensitivity.” 
Zhugen Yang (center) and his students Syed Atif Ali (left) and Nongthombam Boby (right) test out a paper-based diagnostic for bovine disease in a laboratory in India.

Matus notes that the inclusion of an amplification test in Yang’s proposed protocol could help address the problem. Typically, she says, paper-based tests do not amplify genetic material, but rather have antibodies that bind to a particular target. “If [Yang’s assay] could overcome sensitivity issues that are observed with antibody-based rapid tests, then this would be a game changer,” Matus says.
Yang is still in the early stages of developing the wastewater test, however. His university was shut down from mid-March until early June, during which time he focused on making the necessary preparations to hit the ground running when he and his team did get back into the lab. This included the in silico development of the primers that amplify SARS-CoV-2 RNA, purchasing necessary reagents, and lining up collaborators and funding. 
He is now working with a local water company that will send samples to him to test in the lab and eventually will allow him to test the assay onsite. Yang says he hopes to have optimized the test enough to begin validation experiments on wastewater samples within a couple of months, and to send his kits for testing at the wastewater company three to four months after that. “The progress is a bit slow,” he admits, but “we are now in a very positive way ready to start this experiment.”

Inside the Effort to Make India’s First COVID-19 Test/-/ABOVE: COURTESY OF MYLAB DISCOVERY SOLUTIONS

n March 18, virologist Minal Dakhave Bhosale hit a major milestone. She and her colleagues submitted India’s first native COVID-19 diagnostic test for validation by the National Institute of Virology. Hours later, Bhosale achieved another milestone. She gave birth to a baby girl. The research team had worked tirelessly for six weeks to prepare the test kit during Bhosale’s final trimester. She even pushed through a pregnancy complication to ensure the test could be used across the country as quickly as possible.
“This was the time to work and develop a test for the country that could be used reliably. It is true that the hours are longer, but then the reason why we are doing this is bigger than an individual,” Bhosale tells The Scientist. “It was challenging to work until the end, but then it was a team effort.”
Helping Bhosale create the country’s COVID-19 test was a group of 10 people—nine are women, and many are mothers. They work for MyLab Discovery Solutions, a biotechnology company based in Pune that develops and commercializes molecular diagnostic detection kits for parasitic, viral, and bacterial infections. One of the company’s products is a kit to screen blood donors for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. 
Minal Dakhave Bhosale and her team developed a diagnostic test for COVID-19.

As the researchers watched COVID-19 spread around the world, they knew they needed to make a test kit and do it quickly. “Other countries had coronavirus spread ahead of India, and there was already a situation where it was very difficult for any country to source kits and supplies in large quantities,” says Gautam Wankhede, MyLab’s director for medical affairs. “Every country had to put their interests first.”
The MyLab team recognized that, as the virus spread, importing test kits would become too slow and expensive to keep track of infections among the country’s 1.3 billion people. “A testing kit developed in India was necessary to have,” Wankhede says.
Bhosale and her colleagues drew on their experience developing DNA and RNA tests for applications in clinical, veterinary, and food safety settings, and also on the work of researchers who had studied the SARS family of viruses extensively in the past. Following the World Health Organization guidelines for COVID-19 tests, Bhosale and colleagues put together the reagents they’d need to extract nucleic acids from patient samples and to carry out real time PCR. They also gathered materials to work as controls for positive and negative tests. 
Testing by the National Institute of Virology showed that samples collected with the kit, when analyzed with the help of a PCR machine in the lab, provide a positive or negative result within 2.5 hours—less than half the time it took imported kits to return an answer. And results came in with an accuracy of 100 percent, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, an organization similar to the National Institutes of Health in the US. MyLab’s kit, called PathoDetect, is cheaper than the imports too, with each test costing around 1,200 Indian rupees or roughly US $16. The foreign tests were double that or more.
PathoDetect came at an opportune time. In March, the Indian government was facing intense criticism for lack of testing. To push the kit through to the National Institute of Virology in six weeks, rather than the standard four months for these types of tests, marked a record for MyLab. 
“For a group that has been actively involved in making PCR test kits for other diseases, it’s not unheard of that MyLab could make a coronavirus test kit in a matter of weeks,” says Prashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, DC, who studies healthcare supply chains and is a coauthor of a recent piece calling for more testing in India. “I think the reason we are all talking about MyLab today is because they had an early start.” Most companies in India didn’t start working on COVID-19 tests until March or April, he says.
That early start coupled with the national pride of having a test kit developed in India opened a lot of doors for MyLab, according to Yadav, who does not have ties to the company. Because MyLab pivoted so quickly to make a coronavirus test kit, it garnered early support from government departments and funding agencies, and had the ability to have quick, direct conversations with scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research. “I think all of those things worked in favor of MyLab and everyone gave them the sort of expedited critical path support, which probably led to the condensed timeline,” Yadav says.
Every country had to put their interests first.
—Gautam Wankhede, MyLab Discovery Solutions
On March 26, eight days after MyLab submitted the kit for validation, the National Institute of Virology approved it for distribution countrywide. Since then, “we have been able to cater to a lot of demand. We have manufactured more than one million tests and supplied tests to more than twenty states in India,” Wankhede says. “We have been working on double shifts to ensure that the testing capacity of India does not get blocked.” The company can now manufacture more than 1.4 million tests per week, he says.
“Even for some of the larger, more known and tested manufacturers in the US that scale up, going from a few thousand to a million kits per week required a lot of work,” Yadav says. Once again, he says, MyLab was most likely aided by its early start and by partnerships with larger companies, such as Syngene International, a contract research and manufacturing organization. MyLab also recently partnered with the Serum Institute of India, a Pune-based vaccine maker. The investment from the institute allowed MyLab to increase production of PathoDetect from 200,000 to 2 million kits per week, says Adar Poonawalla, Serum’s CEO. In mid-May, the Indian government also announced it had given 30,000 PathoDetect kits to Nepal. 
Yadav says that test kits from MyLab, and now from other companies that have government-approved kits, are helping to meet the needs of India’s large population. But there is a significant limiting factor. “The PCR machine itself is a constraint,” he explains. Even if the number of tests available reaches a level adequate for the country’s population, the government needs to ensure that there are enough suitably equipped laboratories to process the kit samples. “I don’t think the manufacturing capacity of test kits will be the concern,” he says. “It will be the labs and the system.”

Initiative Recruits Scientist-Volunteers to Aid COVID-19 Research/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SMARTBOY10
I
n mid-March, as businesses and universities across Europe were shutting down in a bid to slow the COVID-19 pandemic, three longtime friends were talking about how they wished they could do something to combat the disease. The three—animal behavior researchers Daniel Calovi of the Max Planck Institute for Animal Behaviour near Konstanz, Germany, Sara Arganda of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid, and Alfonso Pérez-Escudero of the Research Center on Animal Cognition and Center for Integrative Biology in Toulouse—are not infectious disease researchers, but they wished there was some way to deploy their skills to aid research on SARS-CoV-2. 
There should, they thought, be some means of matching researchers like them with scientists carrying out COVID-19 studies, even to perform humble tasks such as transcribing data. But a Google search didn’t turn anything up. So eventually, the three decided to set up a volunteer-matching service themselves, and hastily put together a website for it. Their expectations were not high. “We thought we were going to fail,” Arganda says, laughing. “Our goal was to at least help one person.”
Soon, however, forms from volunteers and requests from researchers studying the virus or the disease it causes were pouring in. The trio recruited other researchers they knew to help coordinate the matches, but they quickly found that a shared spreadsheet and email address weren’t up to the task, and instead switched over to a platform designed for handling customer service requests. About 47,000 people have volunteered through the site so far, and the project, known as Crowdfight COVID-19, has matched more than 100 requests with one or more volunteers. 
It has given us the chance to contribute.
—Tom Karagiannis, Monash University
The breadth of request types has extended far beyond the mechanical tasks Pérez-Escudero initially envisioned, he says. Instead, many researchers file requests for volunteers with specialized skills, or access to certain reagents or types of data. “A surprising proportion of the requests actually end in collaboration . . . between the requestor and the volunteers,” he says.
One request for specialized skills came from Antonio Fernández Anta, a computer scientist at IMDEA Networks Institute in Madrid. He and his collaborators devised a survey—initially deployed in Spain and then a handful of other countries for which he and his collaborators could translate the survey into the local languages—to track the incidence of COVID-19 by having respondents report their location and how many people they knew who had the disease. When they decided to expand the survey to cover the whole world, they sought Crowdfight’s help with getting it translated into more languages, and with building a website. “It worked beautifully . . . we got it translated to more than 60 languages,” Fernández Anta says, and got help on the website as well. He’s planning to turn to Crowdfight for help again soon after he and his collaborators make some changes to the survey.
Daniel Calovi, Sara Arganda, and Alfonso Pérez-Escudero, shown here in 2018, set up Crowdfight COVID-19 earlier this year.

It’s gratifying to read the responses from requestors after they’re matched with volunteers, Pérez-Escudero says. “I think they make the request thinking that it’s going to be too hard, or maybe we don’t even exist,” he says, so they’re often pleasantly surprised to hear that a scientist volunteer has been found and is ready to help. Sometimes even Pérez-Escudero himself is surprised to be able to make a match, such as when Crowdfight was able to fulfill a request from a researcher seeking a Sydney-based expert in neutrophils with a lab with the biosafety rating BSL-3. 
Tom Karagiannis, a diabetes researcher at Monash University in Australia, was also pleasantly surprised by the outcome of his request. When he asked in mid-March for supercomputing resources for a series of studies modeling binding sites on a SARS-CoV-2 protein and their interactions with potential antivirals, he didn’t have high expectations, he writes in an email to The Scientist. But Pérez-Escudero wrote back within hours, Karagiannis continues, and quickly connected him with the resources he needed. 
Karagiannis says that he hopes Crowdfight COVID-19 can help again as he seeks collaborators to run assays on the antivirals. The project is “a very important service,” he says, “especially for labs like mine that are coming into the COVID-19 research domain, with relevant expertise but from different fields, with few contacts and little to no funding for COVID-19 research. It has given us the chance to contribute.”
It hasn’t been easy juggling the work required for Crowdfight COVID-19 while remotely continuing research for their own labs, Pérez-Escudero and Arganda say, but they have no plans to wind the project down. It recently won funding from the European Union, which the team plans to use to hire someone who can keep the platform going in the long term. They’re also experimenting with expanding the approach beyond COVID-19, Pérez-Escudero says. In research, he notes, symmetric collaborations are common, but “we very rarely do this thing of, I help you, and maybe tomorrow, someone else will help me. And we think that this is very powerful.”

Counting the Lives Saved by Lockdowns—and Lost to Slow Action/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CREATIVE-TOUCH
O
n May 20, disease modelers at Columbia University posted a preprint that concluded the US could have prevented 36,000 of the 65,300 deaths that the country had suffered as a result of COVID-19 by May 3 if states had instituted social distancing measures a week earlier. In early June, Imperial College London epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, one of the UK government’s key advisers in the early stages of the pandemic, came to a similar conclusion about the UK. In evidence he presented to a parliamentary committee inquiry, Ferguson said that if the country had introduced restrictions on movement and socializing a week sooner than it did, Britain’s official death toll of 40,000 could have been halved.
On a more positive note, Ferguson and other researchers at Imperial College London published a model in Nature around the same time estimating that more than 3 million deaths had been avoided in the UK as a result of the policies that were put in place.
These and other studies from recent months aim to understand how well various social-distancing measures have curbed infections, and by extension saved lives. It’s a big challenge to unravel and reliably understand all the factors at play, but experts say the research could help inform future policies. 
The most effective measure, one study found, was getting people not to travel to work, while school closures had relatively little effect.
“It’s not just about looking retrospectively,” Jeffrey Shaman, a data scientist at Columbia University and coauthor of the preprint on US deaths, tells The Scientist. “All the places that have managed to get it under control to a certain extent are still at risk of having a rebound and a flare up. And if they don’t respond to it because they can’t motivate the political and public will to actually reinstitute control measures, then we’re going to repeat the same mistakes.”
Diving into the data
Shaman and his team used a computer model and data on how people moved around to work out how reduced contact between people could explain disease trends after the US introduced social distancing measures in mid-March. Then, the researchers looked at what would have happened if the same measures had been introduced a week earlier, and found that more than half of total infections and deaths up to May 3 would have been prevented. Starting the measures on March 1 would have prevented 83 percent of the nation’s deaths during that period, according to the model. Shaman says he is waiting to submit for publication in a peer-reviewed journal until he and his colleagues update the study with more-recent data. 
“I thought they had reasonably credible data in terms of trying to argue that the lockdowns had prevented infections,” says Daniel Sutter, an economist at Troy University. “They were training or calibrating that model using some cell phone data and foot traffic data and correlating that with lockdowns.”
See “The Effects of Physical Isolation on the Pandemic Quantified”
Sébastien Annan-Phan, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, undertook a similar analysis, looking at the growth rate of case numbers before and after various lockdown measures were introduced in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the US. Because these countries instituted different combinations of social distancing measures, the team was able to estimate how well each action slowed disease spread. The most effective measure, they found, was getting people not to travel to work, while school closures had relatively little effect. “Every country is different and they implement different policies, but we can still tease out a couple of things,” says Annan-Phan.  
In total, his group estimated that combined interventions prevented or delayed about 62 million confirmed cases in the six countries studied, or about 530 million total infections. The results were published in Nature in June alongside a study from a group at Imperial College London, which had compared COVID-19 cases reported in several European countries under lockdown with the worst-case scenario predicted for each of those countries by a computer model in which no such measures were taken. According to that analysis, which assumed that the effects of social distancing measures were the same from country to country, some 3.1 million deaths had been avoided. 
It’s hard to argue against the broad conclusion that changing people’s behavior was beneficial, says Andrew Gelman, a statistician at Columbia University. “If people hadn’t changed their behavior, then it would have been disastrous.” 
Lockdown policies versus personal decisions to isolate
Like all hypothetical scenarios, it’s impossible to know how events would have played out if different decisions were made. And attributing changes in people’s behavior to official lockdown policies during the pandemic is especially difficult, says Gelman. “Ultimately, we can’t say what would have happened without it, because the timing of lockdown measures correlates with when people would have gone into self-isolation anyway.” Indeed, according to a recent study of mobile phone data in the US, many people started to venture out less a good one to four weeks before they were officially asked to. 
A report on data from Sweden, a country that did not introduce the same strict restrictions as others in Europe, seems to support that idea. It found that, compared with data from other countries, Sweden’s outcomes were no worse. “A lockdown would not have helped in terms of limiting COVID-19 infections or deaths in Sweden,” the study originally concluded. But Gernot Müller, an economist at the University of Tubingen who worked on that report, now says updated data show that original conclusion was flawed. Many Swedes took voluntary actions in the first few weeks, he says, and this masked the benefits that a lockdown would have had. But after the first month, the death rate started to rise. “It turns out that we do now see a lockdown effect,” Müller says of his group’s new, still unpublished analyses. “So lockdowns do work and we can attach a number to that: some 40 percent or 50 percent fewer deaths.”
Some critics question the assumption that such deaths have been prevented, rather than simply delayed. While it can appear to be a semantic point, the distinction between preventing and delaying infection is an important one when policymakers assess the costs and benefits of lockdown measures, Sutter says. “I think it’s a little misleading to keep saying these lockdowns have prevented death. They’ve just prevented cases from occurring so far,” he says. “There’s still the underlying vulnerability out there. People are still susceptible to get the virus and get sick at a later date.”
Shaman notes, however, that it’s really a race against the clock. It’s about “buying yourself and your population critical time to not be infected while we try to get our act together to produce an effective vaccine or therapeutic.”

SARS-CoV-2-Reactive T Cells Found in Patients with Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: An artist's interpretation of a T cell targeting SARS-CoV-2

I
n May, researchers showed that people with mild forms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, have circulating T cells that respond to the virus. Now, in a Science Immunology study published last week (June 26), a collaborating research team has determined that people who are sick enough with COVID-19 to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit also make SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. In both studies, the researchers found that a subset of healthy, unexposed people also had some of these T cells that react to the virus, perhaps due to previous exposures to other coronaviruses that cause symptoms of the common cold.
The latest study provides more solid evidence that there are SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that are induced by the infection, says Antonio Bertoletti, who studies T cells at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and was not involved in the work. This is important because researchers have put a lot of emphasis on antibodies, he adds, but it’s still not clear whether antibodies or T cells are more important for protection from the virus.
Rory de Vries, a virologist and immunologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, was visiting immunologist Alessandro Sette’s lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California to collaborate on another project when “all hell broke loose” with the pandemic, Sette tells The Scientist. Sette’s group had been developing tools to investigate adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, but in California at that point, they didn’t have a COVID-19 patient population to try them in. As de Vries prepared to return home in March, Europe already had confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, so he took the tools the team had developed back to the Netherlands.
de Vries and colleagues collected blood from 10 COVID-19 patients—four women and six men admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilation—and 10 healthy volunteers. The team exposed the study participants’ immune cells to a pool of predicted SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro to see whether or not the cells would react.
The team determined that all of the ill patients had fewer overall T cells than the healthy volunteers, which was consistent with earlier findings from other groups. All patients had helper T cells and eight of 10 had killer T cells that targeted SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These reactive T cells showed up within about 10 days of symptom onset in the patients. The strongest responses were to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but cells responded to membrane and nuclear viral proteins, too.
“The frequency of these corona-specific T cells in these patients . . . is at least at the same level, if not higher than I see in other viruses,” says Nina Babel, an immunologist at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin who did not participate in the study. This indicates that the lack of T-cell response is probably not the problem in these patients, she explains.
The study authors reported that two healthy controls also had circulating SARS-CoV-2-fighting T cells, something that showed up in healthy controls in the study of milder cases of COVID-19 in May. “A likely explanation is that this is reflective of exposure to common cold coronaviruses which . . . are cousins of SARS-CoV-2,” Sette says. This could give the immune system a head start by allowing it to leverage preexisting reactivity to mount a faster or better response, or it might be a disadvantage in that preexisting immunity could lead the immune system to take SARS-CoV-2 less seriously, he adds. While Sette thinks the second idea is less likely, he acknowledges that the jury is still out about the role this reactivity in unexposed people, which has also been shown in studies from other groups, plays in the severity of COVID-19.
The most curious thing “is this issue of cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 from people who’ve never seen the virus,” says Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa who was not involved in the study. His group has done work with MERS-CoV—the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome—and they see almost no evidence of this kind of preexisting immunity, he says. The authors “postulate that this [cross-reactivity] comes from circulating coronaviruses or something else. It would be interesting to show what that something else is.”
Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will help researchers determine what aspects of that response they can leverage and which aspects make people sicker and are to be avoided, de Vries tells The Scientist. “The next steps would then of course be treatment, but especially vaccinations,” he explains. “If we vaccinate people and direct the immune response, we need to know what immunity we want to induce and what immunity we want to stay away from.”

FDA to Require 50 Percent Efficacy for COVID-19 Vaccines/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK, MOUSSA81

he US Food and Drug Administration has released a set of guidelines outlining the approval process for future COVID-19 vaccines, stating that any product will need to prevent or decrease the severity of the disease by at least 50 percent. 
The new guidelines were released during a June 30 briefing with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee during which senators sought assurances from FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, and other high-ranking health officials that the expedited speed of development wouldn’t compromise the integrity of the final product. 
“I want the American people to hear me when I say we will use the science and data from those trials, and will ensure that our high levels of standards for safety and efficacy are met,” Hahn said during the briefing.
Currently, more than 145 vaccines are being tested worldwide, The New York Times reports, and a leading US candidate developed by the biotech company Moderna is slated to begin Phase III clinical trials this month.
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
President Donald Trump announced in May the formation of Operation Warp Speed, a government initiative to hasten the development of a vaccine within the next 12 to 18 months, Reuters reports. In contrast, most vaccines can take more than a decade to be fully developed and brought to bear against a disease.
Responses to the FDA’s report are mixed. Gregory Poland, the director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, tells Reuters the efficacy guidelines are standard compared to other vaccines. “They look pretty much like influenza vaccine guidelines,” Poland says. “I don’t think that’s a high bar. I think that’s a low to . . . appropriate bar for a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine.” The effectiveness of the annual flu shot, for example, generally ranges between 40 percent and 60 percent, according to The Washington Post.
Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, tells the Post the 50 percent threshold is low, a sign that the FDA recognizes “our first vaccine won’t be our best.” Ultimately, he says, vaccine developers should aim for 70–75 percent efficacy. 
See “US Selects Two COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates for Huge Investments”
In contrast, Stephen Ostroff, a former acting FDA commissioner, says the 50 percent figure is too high. Given that the virus “is rampaging through a lot of parts of the United States, I would certainly consider a vaccine with less than 50 percent efficacy,” he says.
During yesterday’s briefing, Fauci discussed efforts to combat misinformation about vaccines, which many Americans view with distrust. Only 45 percent of Americans get the flu shot each year, The Hill reports, and Fauci claims that 75 percent to 80 percent of the public will need to be vaccinated to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Already, efforts are being made to engage with people at the community level.
“It is a reality. A lack of trust in authority, a lack of trust in government, and a concern about vaccines in general,” Fauci said. “We need to engage the community by boots on the ground, and particularly those populations that have not always been treated fairly by the government—minority populations, African Americans, Latinx, and Native Americans." 
Amidst Uncertainty, Flexibility Is Key in Higher Ed, Faculty Say/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BAONA

his fall, students in a new cross-disciplinary PhD program in biomedical sciences will matriculate at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Because of SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic—whether or not the program’s 15 enrollees can meet in person in September is still up in the air.
“All of us are waiting to see how the next month or two goes, so that we can have an idea of what is going to happen before we pull the trigger and decide” about in-person classes, says Georgiana Purdy, a microbiologist and the director of the new program at OHSU. Fall term, when first-year students spend most of their time in class together, is really important for building a sense of community within the cohort, “and I don’t know if you get the same thing if you have to be online,” she adds. “It’d be really awesome if we were actually able to interact with the students face-to-face.”
We have to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

The quick switch to online classes that happened in March at most US institutions was enacted to keep students and staff healthy. But as institutions prepare for the fall, it’s not clear what science education in the 2020–21 academic year will look like. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, about two-thirds of colleges and universities are planning for in-person classes, alongside measures to maintain social distancing and to trace contacts of anyone who tests positive for COVID-19. The University of California, San Diego, for instance, plans to test the entire campus community—some 65,000 people—for SARS-CoV-2 every month in what they are calling the Return to Learn program. 
With the future of the pandemic unclear, though, these precautions may not do enough to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, leading many institutions to explore alternative options, from online teaching to innovative course design, all the while attempting to balance student health and happiness with high quality instruction and mentorship.
See “The Pandemic’s Effects on Recruiting International STEM Trainees”
Maintaining a safe distance between students
At Beloit College, a small liberal arts college in Wisconsin, students and faculty are already planning a module-based semester. Instead of a typical load of four simultaneous courses over fifteen weeks, students will take two courses prior to fall break and two courses after fall break, according to a letter sent to students by college president Scott Bierman at the end of March. 
“The modular system allows me the flexibility to teach my courses in a regular block format with five three-hour sessions of combined class and lab each week, or to adopt a hybrid model with in-person labs and online class in the event that social restrictions limit the total number of individuals that can occupy a lab at one time,” Ted Gries, a biochemist at Beloit, writes in an email to The Scientist. In the hybrid model, he would manage the course’s online content and be in the lab five days a week repeating each lab with a small portion of the class. 
For faculty planning to teach in-person courses, there are additional options on the table to maintain social distancing and reduce the probability of disease transmission.
Gries is one of many faculty coming to grips with the prospect of teaching at least some courses online for the foreseeable future—something the past few months have helped staff prepare for. After universities began to close their campuses this spring, researchers experimented with teaching through platforms such as Blackboard and Google Classroom and holding meetings and dissertation defenses via Zoom or Webex.
Gries, for example, taught the second half of his intermediate-level biochemistry course on nutrition and metabolism—including the lab—virtually. “There is a tactile and mental awareness required when physically working in the lab that is not present in virtual lab sessions,” he tells The Scientist. “I mourn the loss of those developmental experiences for my students in the second half of the semester, but tried to create an environment where students were still engaged with forming a hypothesis, interpreting quantitative and qualitative observations, and drawing evidence-based conclusions.” 
Carol Lutz, an RNA biologist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, oversees a Master of Biomedical Sciences program that will also incorporate remote options next semester. “If somebody wants to attend our master’s program but they live in Nebraska and they’re afraid to come to New Jersey, we want to make sure that they feel that they can participate—at least this fall, and we’ll visit spring later on,” she says. As for other programs at the Rutgers School of Graduate Studies, the plan for this fall is to have face-to-face instruction for smaller courses and to have the labs open for PhD students to make progress on their research projects. 
Yale University administrators are contemplating something similar. The leadership of Yale’s biological and biomedical science (BBS) graduate program is currently planning to offer in-person classes, but they’re also preparing to have all classes available remotely, so that even first-year students who can’t make it to campus in the fall will still have access to classes and instructors. 
The University of California, San Diego, aims to test students, faculty, and staff at regular intervals as a way to minimize the spread of COVID-19 on its campus.

“We may be looking at a little bit of a hybrid between people who are physically able to come to campus and participate in activities on campus with strict social distancing [and] those who will be participating remotely for that first semester,” Craig Roy, who studies microbial pathogenesis at Yale and directs the BBS program, tells The Scientist. “We have to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” 
For faculty planning to teach in-person courses, there are additional options on the table to maintain social distancing and reduce the probability of disease transmission. For an undergraduate invertebrate organismal biology course that biologist Greg Pask will teach next year at Middlebury College in Vermont, he says he is planning less time sitting and looking at microscope specimens in the lab—the classic way invertebrate biology is taught—and more time out in the field, using apps such as iNaturalist, which allows users to identify animals and plants.  
Adapting STEM education to the pandemic
For the most part, instructors and group leaders adapted just fine to the practical challenges of switching STEM education over to virtual teaching and mentoring this spring. But as educators look toward next year, they’re trying to maximize the educational experience in these virtual venues and to shift academic schedules around to make the best of the difficult circumstances.  
This April, for example, Rutgers’s Lutz held a workshop over Zoom to discuss the variety of fellowship applications open to graduate students. She encouraged first-year graduate students to apply for National Science Foundation (NSF) fellowships. Students tend to start thinking about fellowships in the second year because that’s when they take their qualifying exams, she says. But the shutdowns were a great time for even first-year students to consider writing an NSF fellowship application, she says; the process doesn’t require much preliminary data and is only open to students in the first or second year of graduate school.
We want to make sure that students feel supported and connected.
—Carol Lutz, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School
Pask, currently at Bucknell University until his move to Middlebury later this summer, also incorporated proposal-writing into his students’ experience to take advantage of their time in the virtual classroom. For the lab portion of the neurophysiology course he adapted after Bucknell classes went online this spring, he asked students to write a five-page research proposal, an exercise that could also be incorporated into future courses—online or not. A few of the student groups focused on the neurobiology of anosmia related to COVID-19, he says. “In a time when they could’ve very easily detached from their studies given everything going on, they were using current science problems and trying to come up with some novel experiments to provide solutions.” 
Some universities are planning larger administrative modifications to their programs. Faculty at Yale, for example, have rearranged the academic timeline for students finishing their first year in the BBS program. Normally, students would take time off in the second semester of their second year to prepare for and take their qualifying exams. But in 2020, first-year students who have already selected the lab they want to work in are each preparing a document with experimental plans and getting their qualifying exam committees on board so they can take the exams over the summer. The hope is that “when labs reopen they’ll already have checked this box,” says Roy, “so those first year students really won’t lose any research progress time.” 
Meanwhile Kara Bernstein, a molecular biologist and director of the molecular genetics and developmental biology (MGDB) graduate program at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, says that she and her colleagues are considering frontloading the fall semester with classes. Typically, incoming graduate students spend time in several lab rotations as well as doing coursework throughout their first year. “If we stack it so they’re doing more coursework in the beginning . . . depending upon what the second semester looks like, maybe they could do more laboratory rotations,” she says. 
Looking out for the students
Many faculty and staff are concerned not only about students’ academic success during the pandemic, but about their mental health and wellbeing. In an April letter to the editor of Psychiatry Research, Yusen Zhai, a licensed professional counselor at the Edwin L. Herr Clinic at Pennsylvania State University, and Xue Du, a food scientist at Penn State, called for institutions everywhere to increase access to tele–mental health counseling and to reach out to students with information about coping resources during and after the pandemic.
It’s a call that institutions are answering. Penn State students can now access tele-counseling, a Zoom drop-in consultation clinic, and group meetings focused on specific challenges such as anxiety via the university’s counseling and psychological services program. And mental health services at the University of California, Irvine, for instance, have been available via tele-health since March 18.  
Some universities are also including students in the decision-making process for the coming academic year. The University of Virginia (UVA), for instance, has surveyed undergraduates as well as graduate and professional students about their preferences for the fall. In the survey, most students indicated that they could adapt to the scenarios that UVA administrators are considering for the fall semester—including a module-based semester and a month-long delay of the beginning of classes—but it’s not yet clear what decision the university’s leadership will make.

When program administrators polled graduate students in the BBS program at Yale this spring, the top concern for about 80 percent of trainees was lack of productivity, but the remaining 20 percent were most worried about the possibility of contracting the virus. As labs start to reopen in the next few months at Yale, checking in with the students about these and other concerns is paramount, Roy notes. “We’ve said you should not return to lab if you’re not comfortable with the current status. There’s going to be no retribution,” he says. “We have been very clear with students and all trainees that, as we enter this next phase, returning to the lab is completely voluntary.”
As educational modes continue to shift and change this fall, it’s good for all instructors to focus on “structural ways that we can think more mindfully about our students’ overall wellbeing,” says Asao Inoue, whose work at Arizona State University focuses on antiracism, social justice, and compassion in the classroom. Extra stress and concerns that everyone is going to have—whether or not courses are taught remotely in the fall—are going to affect students’ ability to be able to get to their classes and learn, he adds.
One benefit to have come from the switch to remote learning is the more careful thinking about grading options, in the sense that a pass-fail structure and other types of flexibility seem much more likely now, when there are other problems to deal with, Inoue says. Conventional ways of producing and calculating grades in the classroom do not help students learn, and the reasonable thing to do is to offer more options—both in terms of grading and allowing students to withdraw from courses without typical consequences. 
It’s “really up again to us as instructors to reach out to make sure that our students are being accommodated to the best of our abilities in this new environment using this new mode of education,” says Katelyn Cooper, who studies biology education at the University of Central Florida. Students with disabilities or students coping with fewer resources or challenges at home are especially vulnerable, she adds. “If we bend a rule, if we extend a deadline, will that hinder student learning or will that help student learning? Right now, for me the answer more often than not is it’s going to help our students’ learning.”
One of the most important things is making sure everybody knows what’s going on, Lutz says. At Rutgers, for instance, administrators are currently running a virtual town hall for graduate students every two weeks to provide a forum for students to have their questions answered. She also sends a daily email to students, just to check in. “The need for student communication has vastly grown. We want to make sure that students feel supported and connected.”

hen SARS-CoV-2 infects cultured monkey cells, it co-opts numerous host proteins, changing their function through chemical tags known as phosphate groups, a study finds. Among the effects, the study authors report this week (June 28) in Cell, is that a cell protein called CK2 spurs the growth of tentacle-like protrusions known as filopodia. These filopodia contain viral particles and are likely used to poke holes in nearby cells, spreading SARS-CoV-2 to them, according to a university press release.

OVID-19 will not be the last pandemic we face in the coming years. This is an opportunity to learn how to decentralize scientific research and make it more robust. Research is a crucial area in which the world must become quarantine-proof. While some kinds of experiments clearly must be done entirely inside a state-of-the-art laboratory, there is a considerable sector of the scientific community’s research portfolio that could continue even when social distancing prohibits normal operation of laboratories. To do this, there are steps that laboratory heads, educators, reviewers, journal editors, and university administrators should take now to keep the essential stream of basic science flowing during this and subsequent quarantines. I propose that we must now begin to take the necessary regulatory, cultural, and logistical steps to enable some kinds of basic research to be done at home by scientists who cannot go to the lab or who want to minimize their in-person presence there.
For many of us, our homes will become “field stations” so that work can continue. Of course, this will not be the optimal way to do science. And doing real discovery (other than computational work) from home may seem impractical to researchers used to unfettered 24/7 access to world-class facilities. But research cannot simply grind to a halt due to epidemics, and as in other areas of life, we have to adapt and creatively transform our expectations of what is normal. We are rapidly moving away from a world in which we can assume that real science has to be done in large laboratories. In fact, the history of science is full of remarkable breakthroughs that were made by committed, resilient investigators working under remarkably disruptive conditions (for example, wartime).
I believe that it should be possible to set up logistics and operational frameworks to enable some researchers to work on amphibians, invertebrates, plants, microbiota, and many other systems in their homes, at least part-time. Behavioral observation in simple environments, progressive steps of regeneration or development under various conditions, and other experiments that do not require expensive culture conditions can readily be done. Microscopy, microphotography, molecular biology, incubation, and even automation are increasingly available to all via inexpensive equipment.
This is an incredible opportunity to engage with the thriving movements for the democratization and crowdsourcing of science.
For example, a researcher studying the effects of various compounds on spinal cord regeneration in tadpoles could take home frog embryos, keeping them in a simple incubator. They could be monitored, photographed, and manipulated over the course of a week, and then brought back to the lab for confocal microscopy. All of the steps leading up to the sophisticated imaging can be done at home with minimal space requirements and cost, reducing interpersonal contact in the lab and freeing up space in the lab for those who have to be there. Other examples include long-term evolution experiments with yeast and bacteria, and behavioral experiments on addiction, memory, and problem-solving in easy-to-use model systems such as planaria, plants, slime molds, and even unicellular forms.
This is not only a call to normalize and reinvigorate the “independent scientist” role that was prevalent early in the last century, nor is it only about virus-induced quarantines. This is also an incredible opportunity to engage with the thriving movements for the democratization and crowdsourcing of science, low-cost STEM education available to all social strata, frugal science, citizen science and biohacking, facilitation of research for those with disabilities or during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and enabling of research in developing countries.
Many procedures have been developed to facilitate discovery at field stations and in environments completely different from modern laboratories. It is essential to develop and begin to implement a roadmap for what I call Science@Home in which the products of those movements are integrated and deployed across the research enterprise to facilitate research at home, preserving the path of progress despite lab shutdowns.
Essential steps include: 
education of university administrators, funding agencies, and regulatory bodies on the critical need to change long-held, largely unquestioned beliefs about how research must be done
creation of an online clearinghouse that is inclusive to the movements mentioned above and aggregates in one portal all of the advances and resources for science out of the lab, as well as providing information on local ordinances that may govern certain kinds of work 
dissemination of this information to PIs so that they can begin to formulate a strategy that includes the optimal amount of Science@Home activity for their research programs
development of inventory control systems to enable scientists to borrow equipment when feasible
discussions with regulatory committees and government bodies to establish best practices for what can and cannot be done at home (with respect to chemical and biological safety and animal use) and establish teleconference protocols for inspection, certification, and oversight of remote workspaces
forums with journal editors, especially those of open science publications such as eLIFE and iScience, to develop policies and educate referees for reviewing work done outside of traditional labs
outreach to funding sources that already support science in the field for grants to improve and quarantine-proof the research enterprise
Benefits include not only the maintenance of existing funding contracts, careers, and discoveries, but also a continued cycle of improvements of methods and devices to enable science across the world, including in places where advanced labs are not available, making it accessible at low cost and helping move forward the educational and research missions of academia. Examples include PCR at home, centrifuges made out of salad spinners, cardboard microscopes, autoclaves made of kitchen appliances, punchcard microfluidics, and much more.
There are clearly many regulatory and logistical issues to overcome, including inventory control, biosafety, and animal use. But I argue that there is no practical alternative to grappling with these issues now.
I call on universities to break down the outdated, artificial barriers demarcating “official places of science” and develop best practices for facilitating a thriving research enterprise. Partnerships between local governments and universities are needed to address permitting. Foundations with interest in facilitating science in the developing world, as well as government agencies that fund research, should establish funding for advancement of equipment and procedures that can be used in non-lab conditions, as well as for pivoting recent advances in remote surgery and virtual reality to real-time remote control of laboratory apparatus.
The very last thing we should be doing during pandemics is squandering our intellectual and biological resources and losing momentum on impactful research programs after all the grant-writing, review, and administrative effort that has been spent on initiating them. Establishing research continuity and enabling inexpensive science to take place wherever and whenever possible should be the mission of the educational and research communities, not only during pandemics but always. COVID-19 can help us do this.

Severe Neurological Ailments Reported in COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PATRIKSLEZAK
A
lthough respiratory distress is the predominant complication of COVID-19, there are also rare, yet serious, neurological ailments that may arise. A survey of UK hospitals found that some patients also experience strokes, dementia-like symptoms, and delirium. The findings were published on June 25 in The Lancet Psychiatry.
Throughout April, neurologists in the United Kingdom used databases to find 125 hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and also experienced certain neurological afflictions. More than half of the patients suffered a cerebrovascular event, with 57 patients enduring an ischemic stroke, while nine had an intracerebral hemorrhage. 
“These relatively rare but incredibly severe complications get missed, like needles in a haystack,” Benedict Michael, a neurologist at the University of Liverpool and senior author of the paper, tells Science News. “Now that we know the rough idea of the scale of this, we desperately need research that gets to the disease mechanisms.”
See “Strokes Reported Among Some Middle-Aged COVID-19 Patients”
An altered mental state was the second most common neurological malady, with 39 patients experiencing new-onset psychosis, neurocognitive decline, or other conditions.
The patients from the survey ranged in age from 23–94. While patients of all ages were roughly equally likely to experience an altered mental state, those over age 60 were more than four times more likely to have a cerebrovascular event than their younger counterparts were.
“This actually is a direct effect, in some people, of the virus going into brains,” Mark George, a psychiatrist and neurologist at the Medical University of South Carolina who was not involved with the study, tells STAT.
See “The Unusual Symptoms of COVID-19”
It isn’t clear whether these symptoms of delirium are coming from the virus or if the hospital’s stressful conditions are at least partially to blame. The New York Times reports that some changes aimed to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals, such as little human contact from the use of head-to-toe protective equipment for healthcare workers and the lack of visitors, have made hospitalization more stressful than normal. On top of that, fighting the virus has its own inherent challenges, including decreased oxygen intake and cumbersome attachments to machines.
“It’s like the perfect storm to generate delirium, it really, really is,” delirium expert Sharon Inouye of the Hospital Life Elder Program tells the Times. The article recounts the case of a 31-year-old COVID-19 patient from Tennessee, not included in the survey, who experienced hospital delirium as a terrifying ordeal, hallucinating situations such as burning alive, being attacked by cats, and being experimented on in another country. Once, the visions were so vivid and scary that she ended up pulling out her ventilator tube.
Because the UK survey focused on hospitalized patients, it does not shed any light on how many people with COVID-19 might be experiencing milder neurological symptoms, such as fatigue, anxiety, or altered sensory perception. It is also unclear how long patients could expect to experience these symptoms.
“There’s increased risk for temporary or even permanent cognitive deficits,” psychiatrist Lawrence Kaplan tells the Times. “It is actually more devastating than people realize.”
New Journal to Publish Reviews of COVID-19 Preprints/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MF3D
M
IT Press announced today (June 29) that it will be launching a new journal called Rapid Reviews: COVID-19 with the explicit purpose of reviewing preprint articles published about the pandemic. 
Servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv offer researchers an opportunity to quickly publish results and get feedback before their reports undergo peer review. 
“Preprints have been a tremendous boon for scientific communication, but they come with some dangers, as we’ve seen with some that have been based on faulty methods,” Nick Lindsay, the director of journals at the MIT Press, tells STAT. “We want to debunk research that’s poor and elevate research that’s good.”
For instance, STAT reported in February on the withdrawal of a paper published on bioRxiv that suggested SARS-CoV-2 had been engineered from HIV, while an influential preprint on the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 was removed amid a scandal involving the company that provided the underlying data.
See “How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2”
Rapid Reviews (RR:C19) will use both artificial intelligence (AI) and an army of volunteer reviewers to parse out the most “important” preprint studies in need of review. Stefano Bertozzi, a professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, and the journal’s editor-in-chief, tells STAT the AI will help prioritize where to direct the human effort.
“There is such a huge volume of material every day, our goal is to do rapid reviews on preprints that are most interesting . . . as well as those that need to be validated or debunked, especially if they’re getting a lot of attention in the media or social media,” Bertozzi says. As of today, medRxiv and bioRxiv include some 5,900 papers. 
Artificial intelligence designed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will first categorize studies by discipline and novelty based on their importance to health officials, clinicians, and the public. These decisions will be checked by volunteer graduate students, who will in turn pass their recommendations on to a pool of 1,600 reviewers. Each article will be independently evaluated by up to three experts, and reviews will be published without the permission of the study’s authors (although they will be notified). 
The RR:C19 team will publish its first reviews by mid-July, aiming to have commentary out within a week or so of a paper first appearing online, although Bertozzi acknowledges to Inside Higher Ed that the goal is an ambitious one. “When you’re rushing, mistakes happen,” Bertozzi says. “I’m sure we’ll have egg on our face, too, before too long.” 
Bertozzi also says it will be interesting to see whether this new initiative prompts changes to how peer review is carried out at traditional journals, which are not themselves immune to error. According to the watchdog organization Retraction Watch, more than 20 peer-reviewed papers have been pulled from journals during the pandemic, including two high-profile retractions from The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet.
See “Lancet, NEJM Retract Surgisphere Studies on COVID-19 Patients”
“We are confident the RR:C19 journal will quickly become an invaluable resource for researchers, public health officials, and healthcare providers on the frontline of this pandemic,” Vilas Dhar, a trustee of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, which is funding the new publication, says in a news release. “We’re also excited about the potential for a long-term transformation in how we evaluate and share research across all scientific disciplines.”
Gender Gap in Research Output Widens During Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GOLERO

hen New York City went into lockdown in mid-March and most research had to be put on hold, virologist Benhur Lee’s lab at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine was one of the few still running. The lab and its 10 researchers had pivoted their studies of various viruses to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
But with schools and daycare centers also closed, Jillian Carmichael—a postdoc and the only mother in the lab—couldn’t join the team. Instead, she spent two months inside a 600-square-foot apartment in Queens, taking care of her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son as her husband, who works in healthcare, conducted telemedicine over the phone.
Although noise-cancelling headphones allowed her to get some work done from home, and her husband took on his fair share of childcare, her research on herpesviruses was put largely on hold, and she wasn’t able to contribute much to her lab’s COVID-19 research. “This is what I wanted to do with my life—study viruses—and then to be at home and not have a lab [during a pandemic]. . . . It’s sort of like watching a ship pass you and you really want to be on it,” she says.
Eventually, she and her husband, who was recently furloughed, decided that he would move with the children to stay with family in the Midwest for the summer so they’d have more space and help with childcare, and so that Carmichael could continue her research. “I’m fortunate that I have family that can help out . . . but after August, I really don’t know what I’m going to do.”
While the number of male coauthors of arXiv preprints grew by 6.4 percent from 2019 to 2020, the number of female authors increased only by 2.7 percent.
Carmichael’s situation may be familiar to any academic who is a parent, but especially to women. A series of recent studies has demonstrated a significant drop in the productivity of female scientists, especially those early in their careers, relative to their male peers—and the gender gap is particularly pronounced for COVID-19 researchers. Most researchers whom The Scientist spoke with pin the blame on childcare, a burden that disproportionately falls onto women. Researchers say they worry that the pandemic will exacerbate the already existing underrepresentation of women in scientific research and impair women’s scientific careers as well as the quality of research itself.
“The results were not shocking, but they were an affirmation of what we already felt,” notes Cassidy Sugimoto, an information scientist at Indiana University who specializes in gender disparities in research and has investigated publishing trends in the face of the pandemic. “If institutions don’t take [this] seriously, I think we’re going to prolong the effects of these disadvantages for certain populations.”
Pandemic exacerbates existing inequalities
Women have long been underrepresented in research, accounting for around 31 percent of coauthors on scientific papers between 2008 and 2017, according to an unpublished analysis by Sugimoto and colleagues. This spring, concerns on social media started to surface that this gap may be widening. For instance, women were submitting a “negligible” number of articles to The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science since the start of the pandemic, the journal’s deputy editor Elizabeth Hannon noted on Twitter. “Never seen anything like it,” she wrote, according to Inside Higher Ed.
Anecdotal accounts like this have motivated researchers, including Megan Frederickson, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto, to see if a trend would be evident in publishing data. In the evenings after her own six-year-old went to bed, Frederickson adapted some code she had used for previous studies on gender disparities to plow through papers posted to the preprint servers arXiv and bioRxiv, and used an algorithm to identify coauthors’ genders based on their names. Although identifying gender based on names alone is criticized for misidentifying non-binary individuals and often also researchers who don’t have Western names, they can help reveal overarching trends in gender disparities when used on large datasets, a news article in Nature notes.
To her surprise, given her own lack of productivity with a “wonderful” but at times distracting son, she found that many more preprints were submitted between mid-March and mid-April this year than during the same time period last year, which she suspects is partially explained by a flurry of COVID-19–related studies rushing to make sense of the unfolding pandemic, she says. However, while the number of male coauthors of arXiv preprints grew by 6.4 percent from 2019 to 2020, the number of female authors increased only by 2.7 percent.
Researchers developed a real-time tool to track the representation of female coauthors on preprint studies in the months preceding and during the pandemic. Across different preprint servers, the largest dip among female first authorship was seen on medRxiv, from nearly 36 percent in December to around 20 percent in April.  
PHILIPPE VINCENT-LAMARRE, CASSIDY R. SUGIMOTO AND VINCENT LARIVIÈRE 
Sugimoto found a similar trend in an analysis of 11 different preprint repositories. She and her colleagues even created a real-time tracker so anyone can monitor how these trends evolve over time. To her, the relative drop in women’s productivity is particularly striking given that in the months before the pandemic, the percentage of female authors on arXiv and bioRxiv preprints was on the rise. “It does look like when people have gone to look, they’ve basically found an effect. [They’re] different magnitudes of effects, but still in the same direction,” Frederickson notes.
Sugimoto and Frederickson tell The Scientist they suspect that childcare duties, which have increased with the closure of schools and daycare facilities, are a significant factor driving this trend. Male academics have children too, but they’re four times more likely to have a partner who is a full-time caregiver than are female academics, who are more likely to have partners who also work outside the home. Women are also more likely to be single parents than men are. Even in relationships with two partners, both of whom are academics, there’s often an unequal division of labor. In a recent survey on parenting among academics, Sugimoto and her colleagues found that women tended to take on more childcare duties, even if couples insisted that the work is split evenly between them.
In terms of how the situation is playing out in the pandemic, a recent poll published by The New York Times suggests that the division of childcare isn’t equal between men and women. Among 2,200 respondents, around half of men said they were doing most of their children’s homeschooling over the past few months, whereas only 3 percent of women agreed that their partner was doing the bulk, the poll found.
Women also tend to take on domestic labor and the responsibility of caring for old or sick relatives, and some studies suggest that female academics do more teaching than men, on average, so perhaps the transition to online courses also affected women’s research productivity, Frederickson adds. An additional factor could be demographic, as many more men were hired as professors than women in the 1980s, and hiring women faculty only became more common in recent decades. “As a result of that, the average female faculty member at a university is younger than the average male faculty member. Just because of that, it’s possible that women are more likely to have kids at home than male faculty members,” she suggests.
Early-career researchers most affected
Like Carmichael, Kishana Taylor, a postdoc at the University of California, Davis, has been struggling to get work done with a one-year-old at home and no daycare to send him to. While she and her husband try to split childcare evenly, her son prefers care from her most of the time, often running into her office when she’s on a call or working, she says. “Maybe on a good day I’m getting like two-and-a-half, three hours of work, compared to the eight or nine that I would be getting otherwise.”
That has affected her ability to wrap up some of her remaining postdoc projects on influenza evolution and to apply for new academic positions and attend online seminars and conferences, she says. And it’s unclear how long the situation will last. Taylor says she sent her son back to daycare last week, but “I don’t know that we’ll keep him there in the long term, especially if cases are going back up again.”
Sugimoto’s analysis suggests that women early on in their research careers are particularly affected by this loss in productivity. When she analyzed gender disparities during March and April among first authors—which tend to be early-career researchers—she found that the differences between men and women were more pronounced than looking at overall gender disparities during that time. “That worries me a lot, because we know how cumulative effects work in science: the best predictor of having a publication is having a previous one. . . . This could have a huge effect on this cohort of young women.”
Both Carmichael and Taylor expressed concerns that the pandemic will leave gaps in their CVs and make them less competitive on the academic job market. “And I know that’s the concern of . . . the postdoc women that I know who are also mothers, or caring for other family members,” Taylor says.
Gender disparity could have consequences for COVID-19 research
Two independent analyses indicate that the COVID-19 research field may be particularly affected by the gender gap. One examined authors with typically male and female names on nearly 2,000 COVID-19–related medical studies and found that the proportion with female first authors was nearly 20 percent lower than for medical studies published in 2019. Another study of 1,445 COVID-19 papers on PubMed found that, overall, women made up a little more than one-third of authors on coronavirus research, which was in keeping with figures across other fields, but this proportion was much lower for first and senior authors on COVID-19 papers than in other fields, notes Ana-Catarina Pinho-Gomes, a doctoral student at the University of Oxford’s George Institute for Global Health and a coauthor on the analysis. Sugimoto’s interpretation is that women could be relegated from first and senior author positions into less-influential middle authorship positions. Likewise, female economists, who have also seen a recent drop in productivity during the pandemic, were less likely to publish on COVID-19–related topics relative to their male peers, analyses have shown.
Having more women researchers may be particularly important with COVID-19, a disease that is increasingly recognized as affecting men and women differently.
As to why there is less representation by many women coauthors on coronavirus papers than on studies before the pandemic, Frederickson says that could reflect the constraints of familial obligations limiting their ability to pivot their research to a time-sensitive, fast-moving field. “I would love to have a COVID first-author paper, but I don’t think it’s going to happen,” Carmichael says. “The science is really being pushed at warp speed.”
Pinho-Gomes says she worries that this could have consequences for COVID-19 research itself. Some of Sugimoto’s research has shown that study methodologies and conclusions depend, in part, on the authors. In an analysis of more than 11.5 million medical studies published between 1980 and 2016, she found that that the presence and number of women authors on a paper influence the likelihood that the scientists will examine sex as a variable in their analyses. “Female authors were more likely to look at women as populations of study in their medical research and more likely to take both men and women into account,” Sugimoto says, noting a 2001 government accountability report estimating that of 10 prescription drugs withdrawn between 1997 and 2001, eight were taken off the market due to adverse effects for women, likely because they were tested on men only.
Having more women researchers may be particularly important with COVID-19, a disease that is increasingly recognized as affecting men and women differently, Pinho-Gomes notes. If “women are not shaping the research response to the pandemic. . . there is a gendered lens through which we’re looking at [the coronavirus],” she says.
The same goes for other groups that are also underrepresented in science, such as Native Americans, Blacks, and Hispanics, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Sugimoto says she expects that researchers from those communities may also experience research productivity losses, because they are more likely to become sick or care for family members who are sick. However, that effect is harder to study, Frederickson adds.
Having a diverse community of researchers at the table during the design of drug and vaccine trials and other COVID-19 research “will allow you to get better and more complete results,” Taylor says. “How I would approach recruitment for vaccine trials might be very different from someone else.”
Preventing the pandemic from worsening existing inequalities in research will require action, as well as compassion, at all levels of the scientific community, Sugimoto says. Lab leaders could give certain members of the lab who may have less time to do experiments more time to publish their work, for example. Funding agencies could put more money toward early-career and minority researchers. Institutions could take into consideration that many scientists may not be able to return in the fall because childcare is either unavailable or because they feel that putting their kids back in childcare may be a risk to themselves or family members. 
“I think also just letting us know that you’re . . . trying to find ways to mitigate some of the potential fallout [from the pandemic.],” Taylor says. “I think that would be comforting, and relieve us of some of the stress and worry that we have at the moment.” 
Correction (June 25): A previous version of this story erroneously stated that from 2019 to 2020, the number of male coauthors of bioRxiv preprints increased by 6.3 percent, compared to only 2.7 percent for women. That statistic referred to an analysis of arXiv preprints, not of bioRxiv preprints. The Scientist regrets the error. 
Virtual Lab Tours for Recruitment and Outreach/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GORODENKOFF

id-morning on Wednesday, March 11, graduate student Mathew Rasmussen was preparing for the recruitment events that weekend, when about 50 prospective graduate students were expected to visit the chemical and biological engineering department at the University of Colorado Boulder. When his committee on graduate student recruitment got the word that the campus was closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and student visits were canceled, they sprang into action. “We basically had all of Thursday afternoon and evening to shoot and edit the video clips before posting them on YouTube for our virtual recruitment weekend on Friday,” he says.
Getting facts and information about labs is easy to do remotely, but getting a sense of the people working there and whether you would get along with them is much harder.
—Colleen McCollum, University of Colorado Boulder
Despite the rush, Rasmussen says he thinks the resulting videos are a valuable tool for giving potential students a glimpse of each lab’s culture. His lab, led by renewable energy researcher Will Medlin, “is even talking about putting the video on our group website to attract potential graduate students after the pandemic,” Rasmussen says. Joel Kaar, the graduate program chair in Rasmussen’s department, says he’s received positive feedback from prospective students, who appreciated the effort to recapitulate the lab tours they would have experienced had the event taken place in person.
Rasmussen’s department was far from alone in having to find workarounds to its usual in-person recruitment practices. K. Wang, who recently completed his master’s degree at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, was considering his options for pursuing a PhD beginning this fall, but the US banned arrivals from anyone who had been in China for the past 14 days. Rather than flying to the States to visit the department of chemical and bimolecular engineering at Georgia Tech, Wang, whose father is a property agent who’s given virtual tours to clients, suggested a virtual lab visit to the PI of the lab he was thinking of joining, he tells The Scientist. 
During the live tour, which Wang received in February from a senior member of the lab, “I basically followed the guide and when I saw an interesting equipment like a well-plate reader, the guide would explain to me what it does,” Wang says. “Although the tour was not professionally taken, it gave me a good sense of the personal physical space I will have and how the lab members are working together at common spaces. I think this is important because back in my previous lab, all the spaces are shared, and it can get quite disorganized.” In addition, the professor’s response to his proposal of a virtual tour gave Wang the impression that the professor is receptive to suggestions and quick to implement them. “This is definitely a lab culture I can see myself thriving in,” he says.

Virtual lab tours are not new, but they have never been as common as in-person lab tours. However, the pandemic has generated strong incentives for formerly in-person lab tours to go online. The Scientist spoke with researchers and educators with experience conducting such tours to get their tips for people new to the medium—and reasons scientists may want to continue offering virtual tours even when the COVID-19 threat is past. 
Getting started
Catherine McCusker, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, has been conducting virtual lab tours targeting K–12 students as a form of public outreach since 2013 using her laptop with a built-in camera. Student instructors usually email her to request for a tour through her lab website, and once McCusker finds a suitable time, she will run a virtual event. “I think virtual lab tours can be done well even without professional equipment once you have created a clear program of what the tour will be like,” she says. “I start by first bringing participants for a tour of my laboratory facility, followed by a short research presentation, and ending with a question and answer session.” She conducts her tours live so that she can interact with the students, and she says the response of the participants has been amazing, as they are extremely interactive, and curious about science and what scientists do in the lab.
Macquarie University's biological sciences department develops virtual tours for prospective undergraduate and graduate students.
Researchers who prefer a high-quality video production can seek professional help for their virtual lab tours. At Macquarie University in Sydney, scientific officers Prasanth Subramani and Ray Duell, whose duties include teaching and research support and lab maintenance and safety, first began developing virtual tours of new labs in the university’s biological sciences department for prospective undergraduate and graduate students eight years ago. Subramani says that in addition to professional videography, a good script is crucial; in their videos, the storylines highlight the benefits of the spaces being toured and paint a picture of the lab experience there. Once Subramani and Duell have finalized their script, they work with colleagues in the university’s marketing department to film and edit it. As an alternative, researchers could contract with a professional videographer from outside the university, Subramani notes. 
In many ways, a virtual lab tour can be more advantageous than a physical one.
—Wendy Jarrett, Understanding Animal Research
Once a video is put together, “it is also useful to get feedback on the draft production from multiple stakeholder groups before making the virtual lab tours public,” Subramani says. He’s heard from prospective students and researchers that the virtual tours helped contribute to a positive first impression of the department.
Creating a highly professional virtual lab tour can take significant effort, according to Wendy Jarrett, the head of Understanding Animal Research, a UK advocacy group. “It’s not possible to create the perfect tour without the buy-in of all the staff involved, especially the senior management,” she notes. “You also need an internal ‘champion’ of the project who can lead and make sure that staff are available for videos and photography.” 
The human touch
Colleen McCollum, a graduate student in the same department as Rasmussen, was tasked with creating a lab tour for the department’s virtual recruitment weekend. “My lab mates felt that getting facts and information about labs is easy to do remotely, but getting a sense of the people working there and whether you would get along with them is much harder,” she says. Her lab decided to gear their tour toward reflecting the lab’s fun side and sense of community by injecting humorous sound effects and explaining experiments in simple terms. McCollum adds that if she’d had more time, she “would have included clear captions to improve accessibility and contact information . . . in case prospective students have questions.”
Alex Dainis produced a virtual tour of her lab for the public as part of her series on life as a graduate student.
Including the human element may be complicated by the fact that many labs currently have few to no people working onsite due to social distancing measures. But there are ways to convey hints of the lab community even when members aren’t physically present, says Alex Dainis, who as a PhD student at Stanford University filmed virtual lab tours for the general public at night when there no lab members were working, and who went on to found Helicase Media, a company that provides science communications and video production services, in 2019. “One way to introduce the audience to the people working in the lab is to include the little things that make a lab personal,” she says—“a picture someone’s child has drawn at their desk, or the paper mustache someone has pasted onto the centrifuge, or the dog quote calendar by the door. These little things remind viewers that the lab is a place where real people work.”
Continuing virtual tours after the pandemic
Researchers with experience filming virtual tours say they offer great value, and not just when labs and universities are closed. “Virtual lab tours are great educational tools to provide the public with more information about research,” says Jarrett. She and her colleague Richard Scrase have been creating professional tours of animal facilities since 2016 to explain to the public why animals are used in research. 
“It’s great for people, not just scientists, to visit a research facility, but it’s just not practical to have too many people touring facilities,” Jarrett says. Virtual tours can reach more people, she says, and are more accessible for people with mobility difficulties or other medical conditions. “Furthermore, visitors can sit at home at their own comfort to explore our facilities. They can focus on things they find interesting and skip areas that do not interest them so much,” Jarrett notes. “In many ways, a virtual lab tour can be more advantageous than a physical one.” 
Virtual tours can also contribute to formal learning, says David Hampton, who runs an online master’s program in translational neurology at the University of Edinburgh and uses virtual lab tours for his classes and to create a sense of community. Using a 360° camera and video editing software, he has developed interactive tours to give his students a flavor of the environment in clinical and laboratory settings. The tours, which include information about different clinical environment and their impact on patients, as well as lab equipment and procedures, “work as teaching materials for my students who are learning remotely and may never step foot on the campus and the labs,” Hampton says. And videos of Edinburgh landmarks, including the university campus and the National Museum of Scotland, give his students a peek into the environment in the city, he adds, helping to build a sense of community.
What Makes an Effective Lab Tour
Here are tips from researchers with experience organizing virtual lab tours.
Be yourself: Consider doing a live tour and connect personally with the participants.
—Catherine McCusker, assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Boston
Be accessible: “Make sure that information from interviewees and captions (if included) are in plain language so that the layperson can understand.”
—Richard Scrase, head of online communications at Understanding Animal Research
Be as comprehensive as possible: “One should avoid assuming that the audience will not find certain aspects of a lab facility interesting. One should aim to be as comprehensive as possible so that the audience can linger on the equipment and processes they find most interesting.”
—Wendy Jarrett, chief executive of Understanding Animal Research
Tap free resources: There are many free video editing software options, such as iMovie—use them!
—Alex Dainis, founder of Helicase Media
Invest when warranted: Having access to tools like 360° cameras and software (such as Pano2VR or 3DVista) will allow one to put tours together with greater ease and more professionally.
—David Hampton, teaching and support lead at the University of Edinburgh

Acceleration in New COVID-19 Cases in Some US States Causes Alarm/-/The cumulative number of cases in each state since the beginning of March (adjusted to the same scale). States highlighted in orange have seen more than a 50 percent increase in the average number of reported daily new cases in the last two weeks compared to the two-week period before that. 
C. OFFORD/DATA FROM US STATE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES
T
he growth in the number of COVID-19 cases is accelerating substantially in more than one-quarter of US states, as federal and local governments grapple with how to ease lockdown measures brought in to help slow the pandemic.
Arizona, Texas, Florida, and Oregon are among 14 states to have seen more than a 50 percent increase in the average number of daily new cases in the last two weeks compared with the two weeks before that. So far, the US has counted more than 2 million cases and 120,000 deaths from COVID-19.
“The situation in Florida and Arizona is really concerning,” Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage tells Reuters. The data from these states indicate that there is an “underlying outbreak of unknown size,” not just higher case numbers due to increases in testing, he adds.
Arizona reported a state record of 3,246 new cases on Friday (June 19), surpassing the previous day’s record of 2,519. California, Florida, and Nevada also hit record numbers of new infections, reporting 4,317, 3,822, and 410 cases, respectively, on Friday.  
These states are also seeing higher numbers of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. KOLD News 13 reported last week that intensive care units (ICU) were rapidly reaching capacity in southern Arizona hospitals, while over the weekend, California hit a record number of 3,702 people hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19, plus a further 1,102 hospitalized with suspected COVID-19, NPR reports.
Some health researchers have suggested that the relaxation of social distancing and other measures in some states earlier this month may have contributed to the spikes in cases.
Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, tells NPR that accelerating rates of infection in Arizona and parts of Texas, for example, are likely due to the removal of public restrictions combined with public health systems that are already under strain.
“It was just open it up and then more or less business as usual, with a little bit of window dressing,” Hotez says. “This is not an abstract number of cases. We’re seeing people pile into intensive care units.” Hospitalizations of people testing positive for COVID-19 hit a record high in Texas this week, with more than 3,700 people admitted as of yesterday. State officials have said that hospitals still have plenty more beds to accommodate an influx.
Health authorities in some areas of Texas have also cited “COVID-19 fatigue” among young people, who have been able to patronize bars and restaurants operating at 75 percent capacity since mid-June and may have been adhering less to social distancing measures than before.
“Fewer people are getting tested, but more people are becoming positive,” Galveston County’s local health authority, Philip Keiser, says in a statement, The Texas Tribune reports. “Of those becoming positive, they are overrepresented by young people.”
Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned in a press conference this week that failure to maintain social distancing could result in bars and restaurants having their alcohol licenses suspended for one or two months. Infections are spreading at “an unacceptable rate,” he said.
In Oregon, at least 236 new cases have been linked to a church in Union County, where there were reports of hundreds of people gathering and singing during a service on May 24, according to The Oregonian. Large gatherings in places of worship weren’t permitted in the county until June 5.
That outbreak accounted for nearly half of the new cases reported statewide in the first half of last week. However, “many of the recent positive cases are touching various areas of our community and are not confined to one location,” Carrie Brogoitti, the public health administrator for the Center for Human Development in Union County, said in a statement, OPB reports.
Oregon was one of several states, along with Utah and Tennessee, to pause the lifting of restrictions as the rate of new infections began to climb earlier this month, according to Politico. Yesterday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards announced that he too would delay the next phase of reopening as infections picked up pace across the state.
“We simply are not ready to move to the next phase, and ease restrictions further as businesses open widely,” Edwards said in a statement that also acknowledged the spikes in cases seen in neighboring states such as Texas, Alabama, and Florida, and implored people to maintain physical distance.
“It is up to all of us to check our own behaviors and to take responsibility for slowing the spread of COVID,” he continued. “We do not want to have to go back to a time of increased restrictions where fewer businesses could operate.”
Some health officials have also expressed concerns about the potential for COVID-19 transmission during protests taking place across the country in the last month in response to the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that early data indicate that transmission at these events was minimal, possibly thanks to their outdoor location and the wearing of masks by many people who attended.

W
hile scientific misinformation from social media and from high-profile published papers has spread like wildfire in these past four months, there has also been an astoundingly rapid dissemination of validated scientific research published since the first case of COVID-19 was reported. Under normal conditions, scientific research is meant to be a slow, peer-reviewed, and calculated process of developing and testing a hypothesis, reporting the answers, and, finally, waiting for the scientific community to corroborate or disprove the findings. We are experiencing unprecedented times, and the scientific community has stepped up to address this pandemic.
There are many critical research milestones that have been either achieved or in active development and reported in thousands of papers published about the coronavirus pandemic. These include: 1) deciphering the genetic code of the virus and how it infects cells; 2) developing accurate assays to detect the virus in people; 3) developing accurate assays to measure the level of antibody titers that should protect individuals from infections; 4) testing treatments and cures; and 5) conducting clinical trials of vaccines. 
In an incredibly short time, scientists at research universities and biotech companies have achieved remarkable successes regarding the first three milestones and have made impressive achievements in the latter two milestones that will hopefully lead to cures and vaccines. Despite the parallel dissemination of scientific misinformation, this progress is still a testament to the machinery of science and the passion of scientists. Comparing the timelines of COVID-19 accomplishments to those of previous RNA virus pandemics highlights just how rapidly research has moved. 
The rapid pace of publishing scientific preprints and peer-reviewed articles during this pandemic is bound to result in some mistakes from inaccurate data or poor analyses, but this casualty is worth it in light of the astonishing progress that has been made and will continue to be made in the face of this global threat.
For example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was a term first used by the US Center for Disease Control on September 24, 1982, almost 18 months after the first cited report (June 5, 1981) of five AIDS patients. And it wasn’t until 1984—almost four years after the first case—when Pasteur Institute and National Institutes of Health scientists independently reported the discovery of a retrovirus (HIV) that caused AIDS. Two years after that, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the first commercial blood test to detect HIV. A year later, in March 1987, the FDA approved the first anti-retroviral drug for AIDS, zidovudine (AZT), in a record 20 months. Finally, the first clinical trial for a vaccine began in August 1987, and VaxGen launched the large-scale trial in 1998. These clinical trials failed, leading this now-merged company (Diadexus Inc.) to bankruptcy in 2016. To date, there are only a few ongoing clinical vaccine studies, but no FDA-approved HIV vaccines.
By comparison, scientific milestones were significantly accelerated in response to the SARS epidemic of 2003. On November 16, 2002, the first case of atypical pneumonia, probably caused by the SARS-CoV virus, was reported in southern China. Less than five months later, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV. By May and December 2003, two articles the New England Journal of Medicine described the application of real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to accurately detect SARS-CoV in human blood or tissue. Real-time RT-PCR is a very fast and precise method to amplify viral RNA that quantifies viral particles in human biological samples (that is, blood or a nasal swab), and it is extensively used in the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the response to the SARS outbreak did not deliver the milestones we’ve seen in just a few short months with COVID-19. Currently, there is no medication that is known to effectively treat SARS. Treatment is only supportive. In part because the SARS pandemic subsided with a few years, there are no listed clinical trials for SARS and no FDA-approved vaccine for this virus.
The rapid progress to achieve scientific milestones is being seen in real time with COVID-19. On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province that later become known as SARS-CoV-2. Less than two weeks later, on January 12, the first genomic characterization of the virus was reported. Across the globe scientists quickly launched trials to examine the potential efficacy of treatments in randomized or open-label clinical trials. The FDA issued its first emergency use authorization (EUA) of a real time RT-PCR diagnostic test in early February. There are now scores of RT-PCR assays with high accuracy and few false-positives with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory pathogens.The FDA issued the an EUA to Abbott for an assay to detect antibodies against this virus in March, and now lists more than a dozen serology tests given EUA. 
Vaccine development for COVID-19 has been similarly rapid and robust, with dozens of companies and collaborators developing and trialing both conventional and innovative technologies. Traditional methods include designing a vaccine with an inactive or attenuated virus that will not infect the recipient but trains the immune system to prevent viral infectivity. New technologies include one that introduces a messenger RNA into an individual so that it can direct cells to make critical COVID-19 viral proteins that are viewed by the immune system as “foreign” and enable the body to build effective immunity. This approach, used by Moderna in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has not been used in any approved vaccines to date. On May 22, 2020, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said it’s still possible that a coronavirus vaccine using classical or innovative technologies will be available in the US by December. There are now more than 100 potential vaccines in clinical trials running at an unprecedented pace.
The rapid pace of publishing scientific preprints and peer-reviewed articles during this pandemic is bound to result in some mistakes from inaccurate data or poor analyses, but this casualty is worth it in light of the astonishing progress that has been made and will continue to be made in the face of this global threat. History has shown that the scientific community takes full advantage of peer review, collaborations, confirmatory studies from other scientists, and self-assessment to correct scientific mistakes. The rapid pace of scientific research in its ongoing search for truth is not perfect, but the accelerated response has great merit and potential to be used for current and future pandemics.

Opinion: Scientists in the US and China Collaborating on COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, METAMORWORKS
T
he US and China, the largest scientific research producers, are now international adversaries in the midst of a global health crisis. Since the new coronavirus was discovered, geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing in relation to COVID-19 have been appearing on major news outlets daily, and the US-China trade war has escalated to a looming “new cold war.” Despite such turmoil, scientists around the world, including researchers in the US and China, are collaborating at a higher rate than ever before to address COVID-19, according to our analysis of SCOPUS bibliometric data.
Even before the current pandemic, geopolitical tensions were brewing as global rivalry between the two superpowers was steadily intensifying, and the decoupling trend between the two countries has been ongoing for some time. But experts have speculated that COVID-19 accelerated preexisting skepticism by the US, especially about the country’s economic overreliance on China. And when it comes to SARS-CoV-2 itself, there is a high level of suspicion and distrust between the governments. While US leaders have referred to the new coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus,” Chinese leaders have accused the US Army of bringing the virus to Wuhan. As an example of the international strain, the US director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center told NPR, “we have full expectation that China will do everything in their power to obtain any viable research that we are conducting here in the U.S.” US policymakers have also warned that cooperation with China is “a self-harming exercise in a zero-sum competition for global leadership.” US President Donald Trump ordered US withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) for siding with China in its tackling of COVID-19, while China accused Trump of transferring blame for US’s mismanagement of the pandemic. 
In the face of such tense political rhetoric, China has enacted policy changes that may discourage international collaboration. The Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that any COVID-19–related research publications must be evaluated by the government for “academic value” and “timing” prior to public release. Although its enforcement is unclear, this possible added review raised immediate international worries about future collaboration with China. More notably, China announced a major research-evaluation reform initiative in the midst of the global pandemic. Rather than basing researcher performance on mostly publication counts on Science Citation Index (SCI) journals, China is moving towards measuring quality mostly on domestic priorities, which also includes publishing in domestic journals. This move is predicted to lead to a significant decline in papers produced by Chinese researchers in international journals.
In times of global crisis, it is imperative that scientists are able to collaborate and share data. Our research suggests that’s happening in spades. 
With the tense political rhetoric, policy proposals to limit cooperation, and widespread media speculation, one would expect a decline in scientific collaboration between the two countries. However, our research shows the opposite occurring. Utilizing SCOPUS bibliometric data, we found that the world’s share of internationally authored science and engineering (S&E) research publications on COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to the end of May was significantly higher than pre-pandemic S&E publication trends. Specifically, papers with authors from multiple countries made up 32 percent of the S&E literature on COVID-19 published in the first five months of this year, compared with 26 percent of the general S&E literature published over the previous five years. We also found that almost all of the countries producing the most COVID-19 research are, on average, collaborating with more countries per article on COVID-19 publications compared to science and engineering research before the pandemic. In other words, scientists are working across borders towards addressing the new coronavirus more internationally. 
Regarding US and China specifically, our research findings indicate that the two nations are conducting the most COVID-19 research and continue to collaborate more with each other than with any other country. In fact, their rate of collaboration increased by 5 percent over their rate of collaboration on pre-pandemic science and engineering research. Furthermore, we found that the US and China have the highest rate of collaboration between any two countries with researchers from both countries having collaborated on 122 COVID-19 articles, which is 1.7 times higher than the two countries with the second highest collaboration rate, the US and Canada. 
This growth in collaboration despite US-China strains actually predates the pandemic, according to our analysis of collaboration patterns between the two countries from 2014 to 2018. Our findings also debunked the so-called “China Threat.” In contrast to Chinese researchers posing a threat to the US science and technology enterprise, collaboration with China was necessary for the US to sustain growth in research output over the five-year period. We found that when excluding publications with authors affiliated with a Chinese institution, US publications decreased by 2 percent between 2014 and 2018. Put another way, scientific collaboration across national borders is a positive-sum endeavor, despite political attempts to frame cooperation with China as being zero-sum.
In times of global crisis, it is imperative that scientists are able to collaborate and share data. Our research suggests that’s happening in spades. Although scientists’ international networks, and global science as a whole, are shaped by the resources, restrictions, and incentives that different countries provide, scientific collaboration is not determined by national interests or policies alone. International collaboration also occurs by the extent to which scientists respond. Right now, US and Chinese scientists are exercising individual agency in where and with whom they publish. Science, it seems, can transcend political agendas.

Studies Report Rapid Loss of COVID-19 Antibodies/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CHRISTOPH BURGSTEDT
A
pair of studies published this week is shedding light on the duration of immunity following COVID-19, showing patients lose their IgG antibodies—the virus-specific, slower-forming antibodies associated with long-term immunity—within weeks or months after recovery. With COVID-19, most people who become infected do produce antibodies, and even small amounts can still neutralize the virus in vitro, according to earlier work. These latest studies could not determine if a lack of antibodies leaves people at risk of reinfection.
One of the studies found that 10 percent of nearly 1,500 COVID-positive patients registered undetectable antibody levels within weeks of first showing symptoms, while the other of 74 patients found they typically lost their antibodies two to three months after recovering from the infection, especially among those who tested positive but were asymptomatic. 
In contrast, infections caused by coronavirus cousins such as SARS and MERS result in antibodies that remain in the body for nearly a year, according to The New York Times.
The first study, published June 16 on the preprint server medRxiv, screened for antibodies in almost 1,500 coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China. The researchers compared their levels to three other groups: nearly 20,000 members of the general population; more than 1,600 patients hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19; and more than 3,800 medical workers, whom the authors assumed had “inevitably” been exposed to the virus in its early days, meaning they should have developed antibodies.
They found that while almost 90 percent of COVID-19 patients had antibodies, roughly 1 percent to 5 percent of individuals in the others groups had them as well. The authors conclude in their paper that the remaining 10 percent of infected patients with no detectable antibodies, combined with the lack of antibodies in healthcare workers, suggest that “after SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.”
See “What Do Antibody Tests For SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?”
In the second study, published June 18 in Nature Medicine, researchers compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic but positive patients to an equal number with severe symptoms living in the Wanzhou District in China. They found that asymptomatic individuals reacted less strongly to infection, with 40 percent having undetectable levels of protective antibodies in the two to three months after the infection compared to 13 percent of the symptomatic patients. 
“Overall, these results are interesting and provocative but more research is needed, following large numbers of people over time,” Daniel Davis, an immunologist at the University of Manchester, tells Newsweek. “Only then will we clearly know how many people produce antibodies when infected with coronavirus, and for how long.”
The discrepancies between people mirror what Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has himself observed. In a conversation with Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this month, he said that in addition to a lack of consistency among testing methods, individuals do not have “a uniformly robust antibody response.” This fact may make it difficult to develop a vaccine that works equally well for all people.
See “Why the Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Tests Varies So Much”
“These reports highlight the need to develop strong vaccines, because immunity that develops naturally during infection is suboptimal and short-lived in most people,” Akiko Iwasaki, a viral immunologist at Yale University who was not involved in either study, tells The New York Times. “We cannot rely on natural infection to achieve herd immunity.” 
Insight into Dexamethasone’s Benefits in Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
SUDOK1
Update (June 23): The RECOVERY group posted the results of its study on dexamethasone to medRxiv on June 22.
I
n a press release on Tuesday (June 16), researchers from a large, randomized controlled trial for COVID-19 treatments announced that they’d seen an improvement in survival at 28 days after entry into the trial for the sickest patients who received the drug dexamethasone. In ventilated patients in particular, giving the steroid reduced deaths by one-third in the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial. And patients on supplemental oxygen who received dexamethasone had a 20 percent lower mortality rate than those who did not. In contrast, the press release reported no benefit of the medication in subjects who were not in need of respiratory support.
Although the results, which described the outcomes of 2,104 patients who received dexamethasone, are not yet published, their release has generated excitement. Already, hospitals in US states experiencing an increase in cases have changed their treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone, according to Reuters. Not only is the drug cheap and widely available, but the anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are a logical solution to the immune system overreaction that happens in severe COVID-19.
“It’s a very safe, generally well-tolerated—at reasonable doses—steroid that works predominantly by its anti-inflammatory effects,” says Matthew Cheng, a medical microbiologist and infectious disease physician at the McGill University Health Centre. “With regards to the press release, I was quite honestly elated. This is the first data that we have that suggests that a drug is able to improve the chances of survival in those that are critically ill, and so while I eagerly await the scientific publication I was absolutely thrilled to receive the news and to read about it yesterday,” he adds.
It makes sense that steroids should work. They help dampen the host response. They help knock down those inflammatory cytokines and all those white blood cells going to the lungs.
—Bram Rochwerg, McMaster University
To be clear, the benefit of using dexamethasone is seen in the sickest hospitalized patients, says Bram Rochwerg, a critical care physician at McMaster University in Canada who was not involved in the RECOVERY trial. The drug should not be taken prophylactically or by stable outpatients with COVID-19, he adds.
“I think we were all astonished to see how effective it was,” the University of Oxford’s Richard Haynes, who is one of the leaders of the RECOVERY trial, writes in an email to The Scientist. “We tested it because we believed it could be effective, but I don’t think anyone was expecting to see quite such large effects.”
Dexamethasone is one of the glucocorticoids—a subgroup of steroid hormones also sometimes called corticosteroids—and the synthetic counterpart of the natural glucocorticoid cortisol. Cortisol, dexamethasone, and other similar molecules regulate the immune system by entering a cell’s nucleus and suppressing expression of genes that encode inflammatory cytokines and increasing expression of the gene that encodes Annexin A1, a protein that’s been shown to limit immune system overreactions.
Dexamethasone is a good glucocorticoid to use because it’s cheap—one of the cheapest drugs that is in hospitals—and very potent, says Jesús Villar, a critical care researcher at Dr. Negrín University Hospital in Spain who did not participate in the RECOVERY trial. And because the half-life of the drug is more than 36 hours, clinicians can give one intravenous dose a day, which simplifies treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), he says.
These drugs “have been around for seventy, eighty years, and the utility of corticosteroids in all sorts of conditions comes and goes,” says Rochwerg. He adds that treatment with dexamethasone has proven useful in autoimmune diseases, and in the ICU it is often prescribed for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS is a syndrome with different causes, including pneumonia, sepsis, and inhalation injuries. Symptoms include shortness of breath, faster respiratory and heart rates, and dangerously low blood oxygen levels. According to Rochwerg, ARDS is inflammation-driven, so the problem is actually the intensity of the immune response, rather than the trigger itself. In ARDS, the body produces inflammatory cytokines, and white blood cells go into the alveoli of the lungs, potentially causing inflammation.
See “Could Curbing Runaway Immune Responses Curb COVID-19?”
“COVID—in the extreme case—can cause ARDS, and that’s why people die predominantly,” Rochwerg says. People are sick for weeks upon weeks, by which time the virus might have cleared out of their systems, he explains, “but it’s their own bodies’ ramped-up inflammatory process that’s now caused all the damage in the lungs. Based on that idea, it makes sense that steroids should work. They help dampen the host response. They help knock down those inflammatory cytokines and all those white blood cells going to the lungs.”
In a randomized controlled trial conducted from 2013–2018 and published in February, clinicians and researchers in ICUs across Spain gave 139 ventilated patients with ARDS a once-daily intravenous dose of dexamethasone for five days, then cut the dose in half and gave it for another five days. For 138 control patients, doctors provided them the usual care for ARDS, which didn’t include dexamethasone. Subjects in the treatment group spent about five fewer days on a ventilator on average than the subjects that didn’t get dexamethasone. Mortality rates were also lower: 29 treated patients died by 60 days after the initiation of therapy, while 50 patients who did not receive dexamethasone died.
That trial was one of the first hints that dexamethasone might be beneficial in ARDS triggered by a viral infection—a question that’s been unresolved up to this point based on smaller studies and a 2019 meta analysis that indicated that corticosteroids put ARDS patients at greater risk of death. In the Spanish study, 62 patients—31 in each treatment arm—had ARDS caused by H1N1 influenza-related pneumonia. The number of deaths 60 days after randomization was lower in the group treated with dexamethasone, but due to the smaller sample size, the difference wasn’t statistically significant, Villar, who coauthored the study, tells The Scientist. The latest work in COVID-19 patients suggests to him that the findings in his study’s patients signaled a true response to the drug.
Tuesday “was a very happy day for our group,” he says. Villar and his colleagues started recruiting patients with COVID-19 for their own dexamethasone trial this spring, a process they’ve put on hold following the release of the preliminary RECOVERY results on Tuesday, out of concern for the ethics of not offering the drug to a control group, who might also benefit. Science reports that dexamethasone has already been given to many COVID-19 patients in Spanish ICUs. It will be important to see the formal publication from the RECOVERY team to determine which group of patients benefits the most, Villar adds.
On Tuesday in the UK, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland wrote to all the doctors and hospitals to indicate that dexamethasone should become standard care for admitted patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen, Haynes tells The Scientist.
“I’m absolutely elated with the results at 28 days, but I am eagerly awaiting the longer-term follow up,” says Cheng. And dexamethasone “didn’t bring the mortality rate down to zero . . . so while the results are absolutely encouraging, we need to continue building upon them and potentially trying different combination strategies to further bring the mortality rates down. It should unequivocally be celebrated from the scientific community, but there’s still work to be done.”

L
ynika Strozier, a biologist at the Field Museum in Chicago and an adjunct professor at Malcolm X College, died June 7 from complications associated with COVID-19. She was 35. 
According to a 2012 article in the Chicago Tribune, Strozier was born in Birmingham, AL, and moved to Chicago with her mother when she was six months old. Her mother struggled with addiction, and Strozier was raised by her grandmother from the age of six years.
It was through research and performing experiments on cell lines at Truman College that Strozier learned she was good with her hands. “Research allowed me to gain the confidence that I never had before,” Strozier told an audience of Field Museum trustees and donors in 2020. She was diagnosed with a learning disability when she was eight, which made reading and writing difficult. With a new motivation for biological research, Strozier graduated from Truman with an associate’s degree in biology. 
“You get knocked down so many times, you learn how to pick yourself up,” Strozier told the Chicago Tribune in 2012.
While studying for her bachelor’s degree at Dominican University, Strozier completed her first summer internship at the Field Museum in 2009, sequencing lichen DNA. From 2011 onwards, she worked there as a research assistant in the Pritzker DNA Lab. The Field Museum “has always been my second home,” Strozier said in 2020 to Field Museum trustees and donors.
In 2012, Strozier worked on a publication describing a new species of liverwort, Frullania knightbridgei. This was the first non-flowering plant species, and second new plant species overall, to be officially described through an electronic submission. “There were labs all around the world competing for this honor as the technical rules in describing a new species had changed from paper only to online,” writes Matt Von Konrat, the head of botanical collections at the Field Museum, in an email to The Scientist. “This was very controversial almost a decade ago and cutting edge at the time.”
Even though she was just beginning her research career at that time, Strozier was critical to the effort. “Lynika had hands of gold!” writes Von Konrat. “Our entire team entrusted Lynika with extracting DNA from old dried plant material of over 15 years and only very little material from which to do so.” 
Strozier also contributed her DNA extraction capabilities to a publication establishing the classification of another liverwort species into its own genus, Neohattoria. In an email to Field Museum staff, President and CEO Richard Lariviere wrote that Strozier helped “bring the collections into the 21st century with her extensive laboratory skills.”
Strozier obtained her master’s in biology from Loyola University in 2018. Knowing she wanted to pursue a career in education, she simultaneously obtained a master’s in science education from the University of Illinois at Chicago.
For her graduate work, Strozier sequenced the DNA of about 200 individuals of three known Madagascar bird species and analyzed the datasets, discovering several new “cryptic” species that couldn’t be distinguished by the birds’ appearance alone. “That was a big part of understanding the diversity of Madagascar, which is a part of the world we didn’t know much about until recently,” says Sushma Reddy, now a professor of ornithology at the University of Minnesota, who supervised Strozier’s research at Loyola.
Lynika Strozier was my student and friend. The hardest working, bravest, friendliest person I knew. She overcame challenges the rest of us would have withered at. Inspired by experiential science, museums, DNA, nature. We need more like her in this world. 1/n https://t.co/S5kVeMiaLP
— Sushma Reddy (@phylodiversity) June 9, 2020
Following graduation, Strozier managed the Science Lab and Bio Art Lab at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In January 2020, she became an adjunct instructor at Malcolm X College, where she taught biology. “I eat, breathe, sleep science,” she told the Chicago Reader in 2018.
In March 2020, the Gantz Family Collections Center at the Field Museum granted Strozier an honorary appointment of Collections Associate in recognition of her extraordinary accomplishments and contributions. “Her breadth of skills made her a rare scientist who has helped describe new species both in the zoological and botanical sciences,” Lariviere wrote in his email to Field Museum staff.
“She’s a fallen hero of science.” says Reddy. “She died too early for her to experience all the successes we think she’s deserved.”
Strozier is survived by her grandmother Sharon Wright. Her supervisors and family are creating a scholarship fund for African American women in STEM in her honor.
Estimates Vary Widely for Number of Wuhan COVID-19 Cases in January/-/ABOVE: Wuhan, China, January 24, 2020

F
ive months since COVID-19 exploded in Wuhan, researchers still don’t know exactly how many people caught the disease in the city during those crucial early days of the outbreak. At the heart of this problem is the fact that testing in the city of 11 million people was very limited in those early days of the outbreak. By January 23, the first day of the city’s lockdown, just 495 cases had been officially confirmed. 
As one researcher based in Hong Kong puts it, Chinese authorities were clearly aware that they had a much bigger problem on their hands than that number suggested. 
“They decided to build the hospitals, they sent doctors to Wuhan,” says Daihai He, a mathematical epidemiologist at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, referring to two hospitals with capacity for more than 2,500 people that were constructed in early February in just 12 days.
Months later, estimates vary widely for how many people got COVID-19 in Wuhan. This is, frustratingly, a characteristic of any emerging disease or fresh outbreak of a known one. Unless testing captures cases very quickly and comprehensively, there will always be uncertainty about how things unfolded in those first few days or weeks. And yet, knowing how many people caught the disease in Wuhan in January could inform predictions of how the COVID-19 will spread elsewhere or even reveal clues as to why it affected the population of Wuhan so badly in the first place.
The confirmed case numbers being wrong is often seen as a failure or dismissive behavior from a government. Generally speaking, that’s not the problem.
—Timothy Russell, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
He and colleagues published a preprint on medRxiv on March 2 in which they tried to estimate the number of infections in Wuhan by January 23. To do this, they counted cases exported from Wuhan to other Chinese cities, where, they assumed, more focused screening and testing was able to catch a greater proportion of positive cases than in Wuhan. They also used location data gathered from cell phones by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Baidu, allowing them to calculate the average number of people who traveled out of Wuhan each day in January.
The researchers’ estimate for the number of cases in the city ranges from about 1,000 to 5,000—well above the official confirmed tally of 495. This is a prediction of the number of cases in Wuhan that would have been picked up had testing there been as good as testing at travel points outside Wuhan.
See “It’s So Hard to Know Who’s Dying of COVID-19—and When”
While the range is in line with an analysis done early on by epidemiologists at Imperial College London, who reckoned there were about 4,000 symptomatic cases in Wuhan by January 18, other researchers have come up with significantly larger figures for the true number of cases. One paper in The Lancet published January 31 analyzed data on cases that were exported from Wuhan on international flights. The authors estimated that there were more than 75,000 cases in the city by January 25. To date, there have only been 83,000 confirmed cases reported across the whole of China. Another modeling study published as a preprint in late January pegged the number of cases closer to 11,000 by January 21. 
Unfortunately, it’s difficult to favor any one estimate over another, says Peter Byass, a professor of global health at Umeå University in Sweden. There’s no consensus yet as to what happened in Wuhan and, using modelling alone, there may never be. 
Nonetheless, there is still value in probing the question. Another paper, published in The Lancet in May by Timothy Russell, an infectious disease epidemiologist, and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine takes a slightly different approach. The authors were interested in determining Wuhan’s Rt—the number of people who, on average, catch the disease from an infected individual at a particular time. This figure varies depending on things such as lockdown measures. Based on data about cases within Wuhan, infections detected elsewhere in China, cases exported to other countries from Wuhan, and the proportion of infected people on special evacuation flights, the authors estimated that the Rt was 2.35 a week before lockdown on January 23, but fell to 1.05 a week after lockdown was put in place. 
They also used this analysis to estimate the exponential growth of cases in Wuhan. For January 23, they got a bigger figure than He’s team did, around 15,000 infections. 
Estimates that indicate cases amounted to 5,000 or less by this point seem small, says Russell. He also notes that in the early stages of an outbreak it will always be difficult to understand the true nature of the situation. But retrospective analyses are, in part, valuable because they back up the idea that rolling out diagnostic testing really is essential in the early days of an outbreak, adds Russell. 
Antibody testing may give researchers some idea of past prevalence later on but people may not retain antibodies long-term and antibody results also can’t tell you exactly when a person caught the disease.
Both Byass and Russell say that people should hold off on being overly skeptical of the official Chinese statistics. Public figures have openly questioned whether Chinese authorities have been honest about how many people contracted COVID-19—and how many died. 
Probing the veracity of statistics is worthwhile but, Byass and Russell say, there is a danger of unfairly politicizing scientific results. For one thing, says Russell, COVID-19 is not an easy disease to capture with tests, even when those tests are widely available. Large numbers of people may never be tested, for example, because they may only have very mild—or no—symptoms. 
“The confirmed case numbers being wrong is often seen as a failure or dismissive behavior from a government,” he says. “Generally speaking, that’s not the problem, the problem is a natural problem of how difficult this disease is.”
Other researchers have analyzed satellite images of hospital parking lots in Wuhan and reported a large increase in vehicles between August and December—months before COVID-19 is thought to have spread widely in the city. However, flaws have been found with the analysis, including the fact that some images, taken at sharp angles from orbiting satellites, don’t show the car parks in full. 
Some have used information about crematoria, which were open around the clock at the height of Wuhan’s outbreak, to suggest that tens of thousands more people died in the city than reported. But there is no proof that the crematoria worked at capacity, burning many more bodies in January than suggested by official death figures. For instance, one Reuters article notes that one crematorium only dedicated one of eight furnaces to COVID-19 victims.
Analyzing proxy data such as travel records, satellite imagery, and others is valuable, but a better understanding of what happened in Wuhan will hopefully come from painstaking analysis of biological samples gathered in the city’s hospitals during December and January, says Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a US-based health research organization. Ideally, evidence of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, will be found in such samples, enabling researchers to improve estimates of COVID-19’s prevalence in the city in those early days.
“The real answer will come out after that detailed, hard work has been done,” says Daszak.
Surgisphere Sows Confusion About Another Unproven COVID-19 Drug/-/ABOVE: Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, where some people desperate to protect themselves against COVID-19 have had injections of veterinary formulations of ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug that is not known to be effective against the novel coronavirus
© ISTOCK.COM, DC_COLOMBIA
Update (October 13): Peru’s Ministry of Health yesterday retracted its recommendation of ivermectin and other drugs in treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The announcement, published today in El Peruano, nullifies an entire section of the ministry’s guidelines that had originally included recommendations to use hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin. Ivermectin was added to those guidelines by ministerial resolution on May 8.
Update (June 22): The Pan American Health Organization, a regional office of the World Health Organization, has issued a statement warning against the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. The statement notes that the antiparasitic drug is being investigated in clinical trials, but currently, “ivermectin is incorrectly being used for the treatment of COVID-19, without any scientific evidence of its efficacy and safety for the treatment of this disease.”
M
edical experts in Latin America are reacting with alarm as health officials promote ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug commonly used in tropical medicine, as a coronavirus treatment despite a lack of evidence that it’s effective.
Just a handful of in vitro and observational studies—including a now-withdrawn preprint from scandal-hit US company Surgisphere Corporation—have examined whether ivermectin could be beneficial against infections by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Yet in the last few weeks, government officials in Peru and several other Latin American countries have publicly endorsed the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, fueling a public rush on supplies and a surge in dangerous practices such as self-administration and the use of veterinary formulations.
“Here in Peru, I was completely shocked when I heard that the ministry of health was releasing this guidance putting ivermectin as a medication,” says Patricia García, a global health researcher at Cayetano Heredia University in Lima and the country’s former health minister. People ran to pharmacies to look for the drug, she says, and when supplies ran out, they turned to the black market and veterinary versions. “It has been a nightmare.”
One of the most influential studies on ivermectin’s effect in COVID-19 patients was a large observational study that used a database owned by Surgisphere, a now-discredited Illinois-based company founded by vascular surgeon Sapan Desai. That study, published on the preprint server SSRN in early April and updated a couple weeks later, reported a strong positive association between ivermectin treatment and COVID-19 patient survival, and has been cited in white papers and reports by Latin American health researchers and governments as evidence of the drug’s efficacy.
With ivermectin firmly entrenched in political and public minds as a weapon against the pandemic, the question of evidence is now of secondary importance for some members of the medical and scientific communities. 
But the preprint disappeared at the end of May after scientists began pointing out problems with Surgisphere’s dataset—which by that point had been used in high-profile studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and The Lancet. Both journals issued retractions earlier this month after Desai’s coauthors said they were unable to verify the validity of Surgisphere’s COVID-19 patient data. Investigations by The Scientist and The Guardian also revealed discrepancies in Surgisphere’s claims going back years, and the company’s website has now been taken offline. Desai did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Scientist.
See “Lancet, NEJM retract Surgisphere’s Studies of COVID-19 Patients”
Mandeep Mehra, the medical director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and a coauthor on all three Surgisphere papers, tells The Scientist in a statement that he “requested the ivermectin preprint to be removed from SSRN as he felt further analysis was needed to consider additional confounding factors.”
But researchers who spoke to The Scientist say that it may be too late to walk back the regional and national policy changes that the preprint helped instigate. On May 8, Peru included ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment in official clinical guidelines. On May 12, Bolivia approved the drug’s use for COVID-19 patients who consent and later started handing out hundreds of thousands of doses to residents. By early June, at least one municipality in Brazil had endorsed the use of ivermectin as a preventive medicine for COVID-19. Many ivermectin proponents continue to cite Surgisphere’s preprint even now that it’s been taken down.
In García’s opinion, “several countries are using ivermectin because of that article,” she says. “It’s very difficult to erase what has been done.”

Ivermectin becomes central to Latin America’s pandemic response
Ivermectin was developed by Merck in the 1970s and is widely used in tropical medicine to treat parasitic infections such as scabies and river blindness. It’s also recently been touted for use in malaria control due to its ability to kill mosquitoes that feed on the blood of people taking the drug.
Usually taken orally, ivermectin is included in the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines and is considered a very safe drug with few side effects when it’s taken properly. Veterinary versions of the drug are often used to clear various animal species of worms and other parasites.
Rumors of ivermectin’s potential as a COVID-19 treatment started circulating in WhatsApp groups around early April, according to clinicians in Peru who spoke to The Scientist. Along with unverified anecdotes of miraculous recoveries among patients taking the drug, García says, members of the public began sharing a paper published in Antiviral Research on April 3 that described how extremely high doses of ivermectin could block the coronavirus’s replication in a petri dish.
The title of the study, “The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,” created a lot of confusion, García says. “It sounds like the ivermectin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID,” she says. “That had nothing to do with it.”
The paper’s publication prompted a response from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which issued a warning on April 10 that the findings did not equate to evidence of ivermectin’s efficacy in COVID-19 patients, and noted that neither humans nor animals had received the drug in this study.
Later in April, Antiviral Research posted two letters to the editor that lay out concerns about the doses used in the study and a response from the authors, which states—with emphasis—“under no circumstances should self-medication be considered without the guidance of a qualified physician, and especially not using therapeutics designed for veterinary purposes!” By then, however, media outlets in Latin America had already circulated stories of ivermectin’s supposed promise in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and several hospitals in Peru began mentioning the drug in local clinical guidelines.
Now that ivermectin is in the national guidelines, it’s very difficult for doctors to say no to patients who want it.
Meanwhile, on April 6, Mehra, Desai, and colleagues posted the preprint based on Surgisphere’s proprietary database of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It reported a dramatic survival difference between people who were treated with ivermectin after being put on mechanical ventilators, and similarly ill patients who didn’t get the drug. Among 52 patients given ivermectin, the death rate was 7.7 percent, the authors reported. For the more than 1,900 controls, the rate was 18.6 percent.
A couple of weeks later, a second version of the preprint replaced the first. In this case-control analysis, the death rate among 704 patients treated with ivermectin was 1.4 percent, while among 704 controls, it was 8.5 percent.
Carlos Chaccour, a global health researcher at ISGlobal in Spain who studies ivermectin’s use in malaria control and is currently overseeing a clinical study of its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission, says he had doubts about the study as soon as he read the first version of the preprint in mid-April.
“I’ve been working with ivermectin for twelve years,” Chaccour says. “I opened [up the preprint] one morning and I was like, ‘This doesn’t make any sense . . . this massive effect.’” He and other researchers had already wondered whether ivermectin might provide some benefit against COVID-19, but hadn’t expected the drug to work as well as this study suggested.
Suspicions about Surgisphere’s ivermectin data emerge
By early May, the preprint’s findings were being widely shared among researchers in Chaccour’s circle. So he reached out to Joe Brew, a data scientist helping to analyze clinical results from the ISGlobal trial of ivermectin, and the two of them began looking into the findings in more detail.
The pair soon found claims in the first version of the preprint that were “apparently impossible,” Brew says. In particular, the paper referred to three patients treated with ivermectin in Africa up until March 1, while Brew and Chaccour were only aware of two reported cases on the entire continent by that time. The Scientist verified that a third case in Africa was confirmed on February 27, but the patient didn’t show any serious symptoms, according to reports at the time.
It was implausible that three patients in Africa could have been hospitalized, given ventilation, treated with ivermectin, and included in Surgisphere’s database, all by the beginning of March, Brew says. “Our naive assumption at that time was, well, this is a big database and maybe it’s due to coding issues.”
On May 7—after Desai, Mehra, and colleagues had published their NEJM study on cardiovascular disease and heart drugs using Surgisphere’s COVID-19 database, but before the publication of the Lancet study—Chaccour and Brew reached out to Mehra and colleagues with their concerns. That same day, Mehra acknowledged the researchers’ questions about Surgisphere’s registry and directed those questions to Desai and study coauthor Amit Patel. Desai responded, but did not directly address the points the ISGlobal researchers raised, Brew says.
Chaccour says that Mehra also told them over email that he too had doubts about the preprint’s results, on account of the surprisingly large difference in mortality rates between treated and untreated individuals. For that reason, Mehra told the researchers, the team had decided not to submit the work for publication yet.
This response contrasts with public statements made by Mehra and Patel. A tweet posted by Mehra on April 16 refers to having a paper on ivermectin in more than 700 patients “under review at a journal.” A week later, Patel responded to questions about the preprint on Twitter by saying that “many of these queries are being answered as part of the full peer review process.” Patel writes in an email to The Scientist that the team did submit the paper for peer review in a scientific journal near the beginning of April.
This doesn’t make any sense
. . . this massive effect.
—Carlos Chaccour, ISGlobal
In the statement to The Scientist, Mehra denies that he was aware of any potential discrepancies in the Surgisphere database “until questions were raised after the publication of The Lancet study” in late May. He did not respond to requests for comment about the influence of the ivermectin study on health policy in Latin America or about why the preprint was left online until then.
By May 29, when Chaccour, Brew, and ISGlobal clinical epidemiologist Alberto García-Basteiro published their concerns in an article for ISGlobal’s website, the preprint had been downloaded more than 15,000 times and cited as support for ivermectin’s efficacy by researchers and doctors in Peru, Brazil, and Chile, among other countries. 
Now that scientists and journals have raised doubts about the validity of Surgisphere’s registry, it looks as though many Latin American countries’ policies have been informed by a “mix of real data and fake data,” says Brew. “It’s just muddied the waters so much.”
The consequences of ivermectin’s popularity
In the last few weeks, a handful of influential figures in Latin America have cautioned that the scientific evidence for ivermectin’s efficacy as a COVID-19 treatment or preventive medicine is weak or nonexistent.
The Peruvian public health researcher Elmer Huerta, a well-known health communicator in Latin America, told a Peruvian television network last month that he was surprised by the government’s stance on ivermectin and accused the ministry of health of creating anxiety and misleading people into thinking, “if I don’t have ivermectin, I’m going to die.”

COURTSEY OF JUAN CELIS
But with ivermectin firmly entrenched in political and public minds as a weapon against a pandemic that has already claimed more than 70,000 lives in Latin America, the question of evidence is now of secondary importance for some members of the medical and scientific communities.
Peru’s health minister Víctor Zamora, for example, recently told a radio show in Lima that the country didn’t have time “to wait for scientific evidence.” The interview followed President Martín Vizcarra’s announcement that the government had acquired nearly 500,000 doses of ivermectin and around 350,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine for use in coronavirus patients. Zamara did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
That attitude is partly shared by Eduardo Gotuzzo, the former director of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases in Lima and a collaborator on the World Health Organization’s Solidarity trial, which was testing hydroxychloroquine (among other drugs) and was partially suspended after Surgisphere’s Lancet paper raised concerns about the medicine’s safety. The trial was reinstated following widespread criticism of the paper, although later studies have thrown further doubt on hydroxychloroquine’s benefit in COVID-19 patients. The FDA revoked its emergency use authorization this week.
Gotuzzo, who is also a consultant to several pharmaceutical companies and has received research funds from Merck, acknowledges that there’s no clinical evidence that ivermectin is an effective treatment. But, he tells The Scientist in Spanish, ivermectin is a very safe drug, provided it’s administered properly by a doctor. He argues that there aren’t any better options available to deal with the current emergency in Peru, which has counted nearly 7,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 so far.
Faced with patients in a serious condition, “what do you do?” Gotuzzo says. “Give them water?” He adds that he believes ivermectin may turn out to have a positive effect, particularly if administered to patients early in infection.
Many other members of the medical community, however, are worried by the way ivermectin is being promoted as a COVID-19 medication without sound evidence for its efficacy. Juan Celis, a specialist in infectious diseases based in Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon, tells The Scientist in Spanish that he’s witnessed firsthand the effects of the craze for the drug, or “ivermectin fever,” that took over his area in April.
Ivermectin designated for human use ran out by the middle of month, he says, so some doctors started administering veterinary versions of the drug to patients desperate for treatment. He says he’s seen people with blisters where they’ve been injected with formulations intended for animal use, and adds that some patients have shown side effects including stomach problems, tremors, and panic attacks after taking too much of the drug. Now that ivermectin is in the national guidelines, though, it’s very difficult for doctors to say no to patients who want it.
Peru’s ministry of health recently issued an announcement to warn people to take ivermectin only under the guidance of a doctor and not to use veterinary versions. But that update doesn’t address other concerns clinicians have.
It has been a nightmare.
—Patricia García, Cayetano Heredia University 
Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro, the director of teaching and research at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado in Manaus, Brazil, tells The Scientist he’s worried that the hype surrounding ivermectin could lower people’s appreciation of the real risks of COVID-19.
“In addition to the unnecessary cost of using a drug without efficiency, it can generate a false sense of safety in the population,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. “In my opinion, the evidence is still low. We urgently need good [randomized controlled trials] to make the decision.”
Obtaining and explaining new data on ivermectin
With ivermectin being so widely promoted, there’s also a risk that clinical research on the drug in Latin America will become more challenging, says García, who recently started collaborating with Chaccour and local researchers to organize a small trial to see whether ivermectin could reduce COVID-19 transmission.
“Everybody at this point wants to take it,” she says. “It’s very difficult to find somebody who could be randomized on a placebo arm. But we will try. I think that will be the only way to try to help to make better decisions.” The Peruvian ministry of health has agreed to provide support with the insurance for the trial, she adds.
Chaccour emphasizes that there are a number of aspects of ivermectin’s action in COVID-19 patients that researchers don’t yet understand. One open question, he says, is whether ivermectin might interact dangerously with other treatments being trialed in COVID-19 patients, such as Kaletra (lopinavir-ritonavir).
For now, data continue to trickle in. A few days ago, researchers in Florida posted a preprint of a study that found a positive association between the administration of ivermectin and survival in COVID-19 patients, though the authors noted the findings should “be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.” Clinicaltrials.gov, meanwhile, lists clinical studies of the drug in Argentina, Egypt, and Iraq, among other countries.
García says she worries about how scientists will communicate any new findings on ivermectin—or other drugs being explored as COVID-19 treatments—now that government messages have created confusion and scientific scandals have damaged public trust. “At the very beginning of this epidemic, I think people were in the belief that science was going to guide treatment, was going to guide the knowledge, was going to guide everybody through the right path to cure,” she says.
“Now, with what has happened, I think people have lost faith in science,” she continues. “It’s terrible for science and it has been very, very bad for us in Latin America.”

FDA Pulls Emergency Use Authorization for Antimalarial Drugs/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, EDEVARDE_MOREIRA 
T
he Food and Drug Administration announced Monday (June 15) that it is revoking emergency use authorization for both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine—two antimalarial drugs that were initially indicated as a treatment for COVID-19—amid a number of studies that have since shown potentially deadly side effects.
In a statement by Denise Hinton, the FDA’s chief scientist, she notes that the drugs’ unproven benefits are not offset by their “known and potential risks.” 
Both medications saw a rush in demand beginning in late March after President Donald Trump touted their use. But one month later, the FDA released a safety warning detailing heart risks linked to the drugs. A series of subsequent studies cast doubt on the medications’ ability to either dampen symptoms or speed recovery, suggesting instead that they may actively cause harm. (Some of the most damning evidence against hydroxychloroquine was discredited upon high-profile retractions of the published studies.) Data analyzed by the FDA in the course of making its decision identified more than 100 instances of serious heart disorders in COVID-19 patients, of which 25 were fatal, The New York Times reports.
See “Disputed Hydroxychloroquine Study Brings Scrutiny to Surgisphere”
“There has never been any high-quality evidence suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is effective,” Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who has previously advised the FDA, says in an interview with the Associated Press. He adds that the FDA should never have granted emergency authorization in the first place given that evidence supports the claims of harmful side effects.
The FDA’s decision doesn’t mean the drugs will be pulled from the market. Doctors can still prescribe them to patients “off label” to treat conditions other than those included in the original FDA approval, according to Science. In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has voiced its intention to move forward with clinical trials for COVID-19.
“I think that would be unfortunate not to,” Francis Collins, director of the NIH, tells The New York Times. “What’s been missing here are really well-designed, randomized placebo-controlled trials for hospitalized patients.” The World Health Organization is reassessing its trials of both medications and plans to release a statement today, according to Science.
The FDA also released another warning on Monday about pairing either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with remdesivir, which was granted emergency use authorization as a COVID-19 treatment in May. Research suggests the antimalarial drugs may interact poorly with remdesivir, weakening its benefits in shortening the duration and severity of coronavirus infections.

COVID-19 Is “Very Different” in Young Kids Versus Adults/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
BEASTFROMEAST
A
ccording to the World Health Organization, there have been nearly 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19—the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus—as of June 16. In April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that about 2 percent of US cases were in children younger than 18 years, and evidence from China, Europe, and the US has indicated that children tend to have milder cases. In a study published today in PLOS Medicine, researchers in China report that even among children hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, their illnesses were mild compared to adults’ experiences.
This study “adds to the growing body of literature that is giving us some experience with what COVID-19 looks like in children, which, as we’re learning, is very different than what COVID-19 looks like in adults,” says Jennifer Schuster, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.
In the new study, a research team documented the cases of 34 children, ages one month to 12 years, admitted between January 27 and February 23, 2020, to one of four hospitals in Hubei—the central Chinese province where Wuhan is—or Shaanxi, which is a province in northwest China. The patients, 14 boys and 20 girls, all had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The most common symptoms were fever (76 percent) and cough (62 percent), and vomiting and diarrhea were each present in 12 percent of subjects. These symptoms were more frequent in adults admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, the CDC reported in April: 86 percent of adult patients had a cough, 85 percent had fever or chills, nearly 27 percent had diarrhea, and about 25 percent had nausea or vomiting. Only six pediatric patients in the new study had underlying health conditions, such as asthma or a heart defect, while the CDC found that about 90 percent of adults had underlying conditions. Nearly half of the children were also infected with another respiratory pathogen, such as influenza A or B or Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which typically causes sore throat and cough in kids.
What we’re seeing more and more from the data that comes out is that child-to-child or child-to-adult spread is actually not common.
—Jennifer Schuster, Children's Mercy Hospital
Eva Grayck, a pediatric critical care physician and researcher at Children’s Hospital Colorado who was not involved in the study, says she was struck by the number of coinfections that the authors observed, which is different than what she has seen in Colorado. This high rate of coinfections could be explained by the seasons—China was in the middle of winter during this study—or perhaps it was early enough in the course of the pandemic that they hadn’t yet implemented steps to reduce the spread, she adds.
Only one child exhibited ground-glass opacities, a type of lesion that looks like a hazy area on a lung computed tomography (CT) scan and is commonly observed in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. In contrast, 32 patients either had at admission or later developed lesions that appeared as patchy, dense shadows in their lung lobules as visualized by CT scan. Although the children recovered from cough and fever within a few days and all were discharged from the hospital within 15 days, 24 still had these lesions in their lungs when they were discharged.
See “AI Learns from Lung CT Scans to Diagnose COVID-19”
“We don’t get CT scans on anyone, unless it’s clinically indicated,” says Marion Sills, a pediatric emergency physician and researcher at Children’s Hospital Colorado who did not participate in the work. The subjects in the study got three CT scans, which makes it harder to generalize those results to the patients Sills has seen.
Plus, the study’s age ranges “eliminated the sickest group that we’ve identified” in the US, Sills says. “The later teens, who fall within our pediatric population, have been some of our sickest patients,” she explains, adding that the authors may have missed sicker babies younger than one month as well. The authors did not respond to requests for an interview. 
In terms of transmission, 13 had a family member with COVID-19. While 18 total had been exposed to a suspected case, 16 patients had no clear source of transmission. “Family cluster transmission was found to be common in our pediatric patients. There have been few reports of the infection dynamics from pediatric patients to their caregivers, although transmission from adults to children has been identified with confirmed evidence,” the authors write. “However, no evidence was shown regarding the transmission route from pediatric patients to their caregivers and close-contact family members.”
Understanding transmission better could help inform public health policy as schools and childcare centers decide how and whether to reopen or not, says Schuster. “Initially, there was a lot of thought that this virus could be spread by children in congregate settings, which is common for other respiratory viruses like influenza. What we’re seeing more and more from the data that comes out is that child-to-child or child-to-adult spread is actually not common,” she says.
Other studies propose biological explanations for the lower levels of disease seen in children. And a modeling study published today in Nature Medicine estimates that people younger than 20 years of age are about half as susceptible to coronavirus infection as people older than 20.
The study is “a nice early summary of observations around pediatrics and highlights some of the differences in the pediatric population in terms of presentation compared to adults, which is going to be very important for recognizing and appropriately treating pediatric patients,” says Grayck. The authors don’t mention COVID-19–related multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children that’s been identified recently, she adds. “I’ve heard of it more in Europe and the US,” she says, and it will be interesting to look into whether it’s affecting kids in Asia as well.

Coronavirus Precautions Stall Antarctic Field Research/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JAMES MOORE
A
ntarctica remains the only continent untouched by the coronavirus pandemic, but its enviable status has necessitated a great sacrifice: Last week, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the British Antarctic Survey announced the near-total suspension of the upcoming summer research season in an effort to insulate facilities and crews from the virus.
The back-to-back announcements from the US and UK follow a similar decision by New Zealand, and it is expected that the dozens of nations working in the area will adopt similar measures in a serious hit to ongoing Antarctic research, Science reports. The three American bases, which generally teem with up to 1,200 researchers between October and March, will instead be maintained by a skeleton crew.
Stephanie Short, the head of Antarctic logistics for the NSF, told NBC News in April that while the effect on research will likely be substantial, “the exact extent of that impact is yet to be determined.”
Scientists are sharing their alarm over what stands to be lost. “There’s an unrecoverable gap that is being formed right now, and it is truly global,” says Ben Halpern, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who also spoke with NBC News.
Researchers often spend years preparing for an Antarctic field season, where critical data—collected at great cost—feeds into climate science, ecology, psychology, and space exploration. While scientific measurements taken from stations such as McMurdo will continue, logistically intensive field projects will see the greatest disruptions, including the Antarctic’s largest joint field venture, the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, Science notes.
See “Sleep Study in Antarctica Explores Role of Cultural Differences”
The Thwaites Glacier lies in a largely inaccessible corner of the Antarctic, but the funders of the project, which include the NSF and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), poured money and personnel into a five-year monitoring program because the ice sheet is melting fast and contributing to ongoing sea level rise. This coming season would have been the second spent on the ice, documenting the glacier with seismographs, ice cores, and even seals fitted with tags to monitor ambient conditions.
“Working in Antarctica always brings surprises and disappointments, and as ever the safety of everyone is paramount,” says glaciologist David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey, in a statement announcing the delay. A handful of researchers will visit the site to protect their scattered equipment, and Vaughan adds they remain “committed to delivering our science goals just as soon as we can get back.”

In South Africa, COVID-19 Breath Test Trial Set for June/-/ABOVE: Canary's breath sensor
CANARY HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES
I
n Hillbrow, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, researchers are gearing up to start a trial to assess a rapid breath test for COVID-19 to deliver results on-site in less than five minutes. If successful, the test would offer the advantages of being non-invasive, easy to use, and appropriate in settings other than hospitals. 
“We believe that breath is potentially a powerful medium in detecting certain diseases early,” says Mohammed Majam, the head of medical technologies at Ezintsha, an academic policy and research unit of the health sciences faculty at University of the Witwatersrand (Wits). 
“We are evaluating if this is the same for a virus like COVID. Our body responds immediately to the virus metabolically, and in the process, unique gases are produced. These gases are a signature of the virus and a breath test would be able to capture that,” Majam, who previously worked on the evaluation of HIV self-tests for the World Health Organization in South Africa, tells The Scientist.
The investigators are waiting on approval from regulatory authorities to begin the test and work out the logistics of importing it into South Africa, as many tests suppliers have been affected by lockdown regulations. If all moves ahead, the scientists will use a sensitive, handheld device fitted with disposable nanosensors that pick up gases in a normal exhaled breath. For the Phase 1 study, breath samples will be collected from 60 adults with positively confirmed COVID-19 and 90 negative controls. Ezintsha is assessing the product and the developer, US-based Canary Health Technologies, would commercialize it. 
A cloud-based pattern-recognition technology will determine if a COVID-19 breath pattern can be established with accuracy. 
“This study at Wits will confirm the expected metabolic fingerprint of COVID-19 disease in the breath based on our assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on human body,” Raj Reddy, the chief executive officer of Canary and inventor of the technology, tells The Scientist.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can initiate oxidative stress by a similar mechanism observed in other viral pneumonias, according to Reddy, with the production of highly reactive nitrogen oxide species. “This would in turn enhance the concentration of alkanes and oxygenated compounds that are exhaled from the breath. A larger load of distinctive biomarker molecules would eventually result in higher sensor response for patients with COVID-19 disease as compared to COVID-19 negative individuals,” says Reddy. “Our differentially reactive sensor system is expected to generate a distinct pattern that can discriminate between people with COVID-19 disease and those without.”
One challenge the test may face is the reliance on an internet-based “lab in the cloud” for analysis, given that some regions in Africa have limited internet access.
Scientists will then use the breath patterns to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the test when compared to a standard PCR-based diagnostic.
Majam says he believes the test is very safe, as the disposable sensor prevents COVID-19 infected breath from touching the inside of the main device that is used to transmit the data to the cloud for analysis. The machine is disinfected between uses. 
“Any rapid test that could be used to identify infected individuals during this pandemic, especially those who are asymptomatic, is very important, says Burtram Fielding, a molecular biologist at the University of Western Cape who has been working on coronaviruses since 2003.
Diagnostic tests modeled around the same type of technology for asthma and lung disease are globally in use. The typical problems with these types of tests are that they are not very specific or sensitive, Fielding says. “This means that it could register false positives—someone tests positive, but is not infected—and false negatives—someone tests negative, but is indeed infected,” Fielding tells The Scientist. The latter, he says, is of much greater concern as an infected person could spread the disease not knowing that they are positive. False positives could also be due to the test detecting the same biomarkers for other, less-dangerous coronaviruses or other types of viruses altogether.
As with all other rapid tests, this could make a good screening tool if the sensitivity and specificity are high enough, Fielding says. Used as a screening test, individuals testing positive could at least be isolated while they are tested by the confirmatory RT-PCR test, which is the gold standard. “Unless the clinical trial shows a very high sensitivity and specificity, this would not be a very useful test during the epidemic of a virus with such a high infective rate,” he says.
Johanna Lindahl, a veterinary epidemiologist for the International Livestock Research Institute and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, agrees it’s an interesting method, and echoes Fielding’s sentiments, “Other viruses may also produce similar changes in the breath, and therefore could give false positive results, unless this is really evaluated,” she tells The Scientist. 
“I think it is in the very early stages to talk about whether it will actually work, its specificity, and its sensitivity,” Ahmed Kalebi, the group managing director for Lancet Group of Laboratories for East Africa, based in Nairobi, Kenya, tells The Scientist. If the breath test’s accuracy is borne out through the clinical trial, the advantage of this approach is obvious in terms of speed and point-of-care accessibility compared to lab tests, Kalebi adds.
Gerald Mboowa, a bioinformatics scientist at the Infectious Diseases Institute at Makerere University in Uganda, says COVID-19 testing kits in his country mainly imported from Europe and the United States are in short supply. “In Uganda, the total number of COVID-19 positive stands at 241 [as of May 28] and over 108 cross-border truck drivers have tested positive for COVID-19,” he says. Rapid testing in a landlocked country such as Uganda can offer quick decisions, for instance, regarding which truck drivers at the border need quarantining before they can be granted entry.
“I am optimistic that this product will meet its expectations,” says Mboowa. One challenge the test may face is the reliance on an internet-based “lab in the cloud” for analysis, given that some regions in Africa have limited internet access, Mboowa tells The Scientist.
In May, researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel announced they had developed a COVID-19 electro-optical test of nose, throat, or breath samples that looks for signs of the virus’s presence itself and gives results in less than one minute. This product would cost approximately $50 US. Current PCR tests range between $45 and $70 US. “We believe we will be able to produce the tests at a significantly lower cost,” says Majam. 
Canary Health is discussing plans to conduct clinical trials on the device in the United Kingdom and the US, but a trial planned in Hong Kong won’t go ahead now that there are very few COVID-19 cases, according to Anna Wang, Canary’s senior vice president for corporate affairs.
“We will seek accelerated regulatory approval in South Africa as soon as they are confident of the performance, [and we hope] to have this test on the market before the end of 2020,” Wang says.  
Could Statins Reduce the Severity of COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GANNET77
O
n March 21, epidemiologist Haleema Shakur-Still got a WhatsApp message from Temitayo Shokunbi, a colleague at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He asked about starting a trial for treating COVID-19 patients with the drug hydroxychloroquine. At the time, several trials were already in the works to investigate the effectiveness of the antimalarial to counter SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so Shakur-Still didn’t think starting another one on the antimalarial would add much new information. She offered Shokunbi an alternative: test aspirin, statins, and anti-hypertensive drugs instead. These medications, Shakur-Still reasoned, could counter the intense inflammation and other tissue damage associated with COVID-19. 
A growing amount of data shows that intense inflammation, blood clots, and stroke are some of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19. Decades of research have also shown that aside from lowering cholesterol, statins decrease inflammation, reduce blood clots, and prevent damage to endothelial tissue—the thin layer of cells that line blood vessels and other organs. That tissue also appears to be affected by COVID-19. There’s also some evidence that statins act as antivirals. Because of those effects, epidemiologists such as Shakur-Still and other researchers want to see if statins could be a readily available treatment for COVID-19, a disease that has, so far, sickened more than 7.3 million people worldwide and killed 416,000.
Shakur-Still says Shokunbi told her: “Low- and middle-income countries are in for a potential catastrophe because of weak health infrastructure. Whatever can help needs to be done.”
With Shokunbi on board, Shakur-Still, who works at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and her collaborators got to work devising a trial that will begin in the next few weeks. In it, COVID-19 patients coming to a treatment center either in Pakistan or Nigeria will be randomly assigned to receive aspirin, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin, the anti-hypertensive losartan, a combination of the drugs, or standard of care. Another trial in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will test a similar cholesterol-lowering drug called atorvastatin, and there are a few other clinical trials underway that will look at the effects of statins on COVID-19. 
“Effective treatments are needed urgently,” Shakur-Still writes in an email to The Scientist. “Even a modest reduction in mortality from an inexpensive and widely available and practicable treatment that adds little additional burden to hospital staff working in overstretched health systems would be helpful.”
Statins’ effects on inflammation and blood clots
Data to suggest that statins may reduce the severity of COVID-19 or prevent death from it are limited. A small, observational study of 150 individuals in their 80s published on medRxiv in mid-May shows that those who took statins for cardiovascular disease before coming down with COVID-19 fared better than individuals of a similar age who were not on statins. From the results, “it seems like statins are beneficial in this population, and we know they are safe and cheap,” says study coauthor Anton De Spiegeleer of Ghent University in Belgium. “And it’s all that we have.”
The results of that study also suggest that a combination of a statin and an antihypertensive drug could have even more benefit than statins alone, but more work needs to be done to confirm that link, De Spiegeleer says. David Kass, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who was not involved in the work, is more reserved about the conclusions and says there could be other reasons, such as overall health, lifestyle, or genetics, that could account for why participants on statins fared better after they became infected with SARS-CoV-2.
We have known for a long time that statins do more than lower cholesterol. It’s those other effects, the ones they weren’t designed to have but do have, that could affect the coronavirus.
—David Kass, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
One of the consequences of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is widespread inflammation in the lungs—also called acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Research has shown statins can ameliorate ARDS, Shakur-Still says. Simvastatin, for example, reduced lung inflammation and lung injury in mice with ARDS. It also quelled lung inflammation in healthy human volunteers who had inhaled an endotoxin. That’s one reason she and her colleagues are testing simvastatin in their clinical trial to treat COVID-19. 
How exactly statins reduce the inflammation of ARDS isn’t clear, though studies have shown that the drugs can suppress inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and target the cell signaling molecules so that they are broken down before entering endothelial tissue. Acting in those ways, statins could shore up the integrity of the barrier that separates the lungs’ endothelial tissue, which lines blood vessels, from their epithelial tissue, which surrounds the air sacs, or alveoli, that help us breathe. Maintaining that barrier between the tissue types would keep inflammatory molecules out of the lungs, explains David Fedson, a retired physician and former director of medical affairs at the European vaccine company Aventis Pasteur MSD. Other drugs, such as antihypertensives, might have a similar effect. This type of treatment protocol is an example of an emerging concept in infectious disease research called disease tolerance, in which treatments target the host’s response to infection, rather the virus itself.
See “Could Tolerating Disease Be Better than Fighting It?”
Along with reducing inflammation, statins might also prevent blood clots, another consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A small study of 21 patients admitted to intensive care at Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston found that more than half developed blood clots while being treated for COVID-19. In a separate study, patients who died of COVID-19 had nine times as many blood clots in their lungs as patients who died of the H1N1 flu, a team of doctors reported May 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that statins can lower levels of thrombin, an enzyme in blood plasma that assists in blood clotting, and increase levels of thrombomodulin, a protein expressed on endothelial cells that reduces blood coagulation.
“We have known for a long time that statins do more than lower cholesterol,” Kass says. “It’s those other effects, the ones they weren’t designed to have but do have, that could affect the coronavirus.”
Statins’ interference with SARS-CoV-2
Statins might not only target inflammation and blood clots, but interact with viruses directly as well. The drugs reduce the amount of cholesterol in the membranes of cells, and lower levels of cholesterol can prevent viruses from successfully entering cells. A study published May 10 on bioRxiv showed that added cholesterol in the cell membrane makes it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to get inside. 
When the cholesterol level in the cell membrane is high, ACE2—the receptor the virus uses to invade cells—sits at a spot on the cell surface primed for endocytosis, the process by which extracellular material (including viruses) is brought into the cell. When cholesterol is low, ACE2 is present in a region that isn’t primed for endocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 can still gain entry through a less efficient cell surface mechanism using the protein TMPRSS2, but the new work shows the endocytic pathway is the more infectious one, study coauthor Scott Hansen of the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, writes in an email to The Scientist. Lowering cell membrane cholesterol levels, which statins could do if taken in advance of infection, led to less virus getting into the cell, he says.
A recent computer simulation study also found that several statins could inhibit SARS-CoV-2’s main protease—an enzyme essential for viral replication and transcription. The results, the authors write in the paper describing them, indicate that statins could “directly affect the virus particle,” though there hasn’t been a study in cells to show this yet. 
That effect is probably less important than statins’ role in fixing endothelial damage, says Fedson, who was not involved in the modeling study. “But we shouldn’t overlook it.”
Statins’ performance in clinical trials for infections
Although the data on COVID-19 and statins are scant, evidence from other infections, such as influenza, indicate that the drugs could have some benefit. For instance, individuals who were already taking a moderate dose of statins before coming down with the flu had a reduced risk of dying from the infection compared with those who did not take statins, and patients who took statins before or during a hospital visit for flu also appeared to have a lower risk of dying from the infection.
In addition to flu, statins have also been suggested as a treatment for Ebola. In a small study in Sierra Leone in 2014, approximately 100 individuals infected with the virus were treated with a combination of a statin called atorvastatin and an antihypertensive called irbesartan for five to six days. Some of the patients also received clomiphene, which was thought to have antiviral effects against Ebola, for two to three days. Data from the study weren’t released publicly, but individual health records, letters, and memoranda shared by clinicians who treated these patients showed that dozens of them survived the Ebola infection and were released from care. Typically, half of patients who are infected with Ebola die, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
If we can prevent even a small number of patients getting to the stage of needing mechanical ventilation and dying, I think it will help.
—Haleema Shakur-Still, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
Together, statins and antihypertensives seemed to improve survival in the patients with Ebola, Fedson says. Still, even with these seemingly promising preliminary findings, the WHO chose not to set up any additional clinical trials or other studies to follow up on the results, he notes.
There have also been randomized clinical trials using statins to treat sepsis and ARDS. In three of those trials, patients were already mechanically ventilated by the time they received statins; the drugs did not appear to reduce mortality. A small trial using statins to treat patients hospitalized with sepsis showed more promise, as a large percentage of cases did not develop into severe sepsis with multi-organ failure. There weren’t enough study participants for the team to draw statistical significance from the findings.
The WHO has turned down requests from Fedson to include statins in trials to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Letters Fedson shared with The Scientist reveal the organization’s hesitancy to support the drug treatment because of the lack of evidence showing statins will be successful against COVID-19. The Gates Foundation has also turned down a request by John Costello of First Group Healthcare in France to start a trial in several Central African countries with a combination of statins and antihypertensive drugs called ARBs. The reason, according to a letter to Costello from the Gates Foundation, is because one trial on ARBs alone is already underway and because statins didn’t work for sepsis and ARDS in previous studies of mechanically ventilated patients.
See “Blood Pressure Meds Point the Way to Possible COVID-19 Treatment”
Kass says the use of statins to treat COVID-19 could go either way. “It could be that even though it’s a good thing it is not enough of a good thing to make a dent into COVID-19. It’s like putting on a rain jacket when it’s drizzling, you’re going to stay dry, but if you go out with the same rain jacket in a class four hurricane, you’re going to get soaked,” he explains. “So if COVID-19 is more like a class four hurricane for the blood vessels, then even though statins help to protect them, it may not be enough. That’s why we need to do the study.”
Shakur-Still and colleagues’ trial in Pakistan and Nigeria is a small step in that direction. But more could be done right now with statins to save lives, especially in less-developed countries, Fedson says.
Shakur-Still shares a similar sentiment. When thinking about her trial, she says, she can’t decide if she’s excited for it to start or terrified. “Speaking to colleagues in Islamabad, Pakistan, last weekend, there were no ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. This terrifies me,” she says. “However, if we can prevent even a small number of patients getting to the stage of needing mechanical ventilation and dying, I think it will help.”
Opinion: Surgisphere Fiasco Highlights Need for Proper QA/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, NO-MAD
I
n the middle of a pandemic, relevant scientific data reliable enough to support subsequent research and action are a precious commodity. Therefore, we are dismayed to note how easily flawed studies about coronavirus patients, derived from an opaque database provided by a company called Surgisphere, reached the pages of The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)­—and went on to shape global policy about COVID-19 treatments. Ultimately, concerns about the legitimacy of the database led to the papers’ retractions and the reversal of some policy decisions based on them.
Were the publication of such flimsy data in international journals an infrequent or freak event, we could regret this incident and move on. However, this is clearly not the situation. Over the last few years, we have seen a dreary procession of cases where authors under pressure have admitted deception or fraud pertaining to the raw data produced during their scientific experiments. These incidents are not confined to biomedical research. But since biomedical research directly affects human patients, the effects are consequently high-profile. The apparent findings of the hydroxychloroquine study in the Lancet led to other valid studies being temporarily abandoned, thereby delaying research that could potentially accurately illuminate the effects of this drug.
The publication of these studies is not altogether the fault of international journals, for their quality control relies on a peer-review process that is conducted voluntarily by other scientists. Peer review concentrates essentially on the scientific arguments put forward in an article, not on the authenticity of the data. Journals do not normally have access to the raw data, which stays with the main author and his or her research institute. We are in entire agreement with The Guardian’s article published on June 5, 2020, written by James Heathers, where he very convincingly points out the inadequacy of most peer review processes.
The present fiasco and ensuing crisis should surely provoke a strong reaction from the agencies and journals and research centers that are now on the front line.
However, the vast amount of data claimed to be available from Surgisphere (from 96,000 patients around the globe) and the short timeline for defining, collating, consolidating, and analyzing the data (from the World Health Organization’s declaration of a pandemic in March 2020 to publication in May 2020) should perhaps have alerted the Lancet and NEJM to possible anomalies.
The real problem lies squarely with the research centers generating the data, because they rarely have procedures for institutional data quality management. The solution to assuring data integrity and reliability is upstream of the submission of the article and comprises organizing appropriate internal control processes and (routine) audits of all the data generated by a given institution. In the Surgisphere case, the proposed audit would no doubt have helped to sort out the mess, but had proper control procedures already been in place, there would not have been a mess. However, without access to the data, which we understand has been refused by Surgisphere, this study will forever remain disqualified. In an ideal situation, a company like  Surgisphere would bring on board an independent quality assurance (QA) consultant to audit the data contents of the article against the real raw data of the study.
International journals and the general public must realize that the reliability and credibility of studies rely on two relatively separate factors:
First, the quality of the scientific study design, naturally followed by cogent scientific discussion and conclusion: in a word, the soundness of the science. But however sound the scientific intention and arguments, all counts for nothing if based on study procedures that are shown to be inadequate or founded on unreliable, frail, or, at worst, fraudulent data.
Second, the soundness of the data. If QA procedures are implemented, they ensure that the scientific studies generate data of the highest standard. This is achieved by assuring that research work is well planned, well executed and recorded, and that the information reaching study reports, or articles for publication, accurately represents what actually happened during the experimental phase.
Meta-analyses, that is, studies based on aggregated and sometimes anonymized data, do not escape the requirements for transparency and traceability of data. Ultimately, despite sophisticated IT techniques or contractual confidentiality obligations, the published data must be traceable to the original raw data, and, finally, to actual events in the physical world.
As early as 2001, in discussion with the World Health Organization (WHO), we argued that accelerating health challenges during the coming decades—among others, emerging diseases, changing patterns of agriculture, and climate change—would lead to an increased need for new drugs and new principles for treatment. As funding is not infinite, it is essential that basic scientific and biomedical research be conducted in a proper fashion, thus economizing resources and minimizing the production of unreliable and misleading results. We underlined the possible dangers to health of the collection and eventual publication of dubious data, arguing that there is an urgent need for institutional action to implement procedures to ensure data quality and integrity. A handbook, Quality Practices in Basic Biomedical Research (QPBR), which the WHO commissioned us to write, was published in 2006 (it is available for free and we receive no royalties from it).
The intention was that the WHO should set the standard worldwide by imposing compliance to QPBR on institutions receiving WHO research funding. Clearly, this intention has not been carried through; training in QPBR, though planned and with training material available, was never deployed extensively and research institutions have not been required to implement QPBR prior to receiving funds. We appeal to all funding bodies (WHO, National Institutes of Health, European Commission, Medical Research Council, Gates Foundation, government agencies, etc.) to tie their funding to the implementation of QPBR (or equivalent guidelines) as a first step to assuring that the studies they support generate quality data, that is, accurate, reliable, reproducible, and auditable.
An opportunity to start setting standards for data quality management within research institutions was missed. Plainly, an international initiative focused on improving the quality, integrity, and reliability of research data is now both essential and overdue. The QPBR handbook would be an excellent starting point for any international organization wishing to improve the quality of data being supplied by research centers.
In addition, the international journals should insist on receiving, along with any article submitted, a certified document from the research institute stating their compliance with QPBR (or equivalent) and that the data submitted have been audited by a specialist internal QA group or an external QA consultant. Many journals already require similar statements about the ethical standards applied during studies.
This approach would mirror to some extent the Good Laboratory Practice regulations (GLP) already in place for non-clinical studies to test the safety of experimental medicines. Under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) these GLP regulations, applied because of incidents of fraud and data manipulation reported in the 1970s, have practically eliminated cases of study malpractice that were so prevalent until their enforcement.
Similarly, the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) employed to ensure the reliability of the data coming from clinical trials have ensured a common framework for clinical data generation, management, and reporting, rendering clinical data accessible and available to audit. The observance of GCP has become commonplace within the pharmaceutical industry and should nowadays be the gold standard for all clinical research.
Poor data collection, selective or inaccurate data reporting, data manipulation, sometimes even deliberate fraud, and ethical issues were the reasons for implementing GLP and GCP. The amazing issue of this hydroxychloroquine study and its deleterious knock-on effects should now provide an incentive for the implementation of QPBR in areas not covered by the regulations so far.
The present fiasco and ensuing crisis should surely provoke a strong reaction from the agencies and journals and research centers that are now on the front line. If nothing is done now, we will see an even longer dreary series of cases of poorly controlled studies or of scientific misconduct to further shake public confidence in the reputation of science itself.

WHO Comments Breed Confusion Over Asymptomatic Spread of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: FLICKR, UNITED STATES MISSION GENEVA
T
he World Health Organization’s technical lead for coronavirus response, Maria Van Kerkhove, said at a press briefing on Monday (June 8) that asymptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was “very rare.” On Tuesday, Van Kerkhove clarified at a follow-up Q&A session on COVID-19 transmission that she was referring only to patients who never show any symptoms at all, not those who have not yet begun to show symptoms—individuals who are classified as being presymptomatic—nor those cases that involve only mild symptoms. The WHO estimates that among truly asymptomatic patients, 16 percent can infect others. “We do know that some people who are asymptomatic can transmit the virus on,” Van Kerkhov said on Tuesday.
Still, many researchers, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, have challenged the WHO’s assertion that the virus is only rarely spread by truly asymptomatic individuals. “[This] is not backed up by any data,” Fauci tells Science News. “We know that there is asymptomatic transmission. . . . What we do not know is the extent to which that occurs. So when we hear statements that this is very rare, we do not know that as a fact.”
Research on asymptomatic spread has yielded mixed results, and it’s still not even clear what proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will remain symptom-free. While some studies estimate that fewer than 20 percent of cases are asymptomatic, one review published last week (June 3) in the Annals of Internal Medicine stated it may be as high as 45 percent, and noted that these individuals “can transmit the virus to others for an extended period.”
“What we need to better understand is how many people in the population don’t have symptoms,” Van Kerkhove said on Tuesday. “And, separately, how many of those individuals go on to transmit [the virus] to others.”
She emphasized that the information she’d shared on the previous day was based on a handful of studies that had tracked spread among known asymptomatic cases, and stated that she had not intended to imply that “asymptomatic transmission globally” was uncommon. The WHO said it regrets the statement that transmission by asymptomatic individuals is “very rare,” Axios reports.
The scientific community questioned whether the clarifications from the WHO were enough to overcome the initial misinformation. Given the uncertainty surrounding the issue, the way the WHO’s comments were initially interpreted by the public and covered by the media was “a disaster public relations–wise,” Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, tells Science News. “We’ve been trying to get 7 billion people on the planet to wear masks even though they [feel] fine, so to misinterpret [data] like that is super counterproductive.”
Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, tells BuzzFeed News, “WHO is tarnishing its reputation as a science agency by putting out conflicting and confusing statements.”
“On the one hand, I do want to cut the W.H.O. some slack, because it is hard to do this in an evolving pandemic,” Ashish Jha, director of Harvard University’s Global Health Institute, tells The New York Times. “At the same time, we do rely on the W.H.O. to give us the best scientific data and evidence.” In a statement on Tuesday, Jha’s institute wrote, “All of the best evidence suggests that people without symptoms can and do readily spread SARS-CoV-2,” STAT reports.
AI Learns from Lung CT Scans to Diagnose COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SUDOK1
A
lthough the initial wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has abated in many countries, healthcare providers are still looking to identify as many COVID-19 patients as possible and contain the disease. Fast and accurate diagnosis is especially important when unsuspecting patients with a coronavirus infection come to the hospital with health complaints but don’t yet show symptoms of COVID-19. 
Nasal swab samples analyzed by RT-PCR are currently recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19, however, supply shortages, a wait time of up to two days for results, and a false negative rate as high as 1 in 5 mean alternative, large-scale COVID-19 screening tools are still being sought.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to damage lung tissue, and in a distinct way that doctors are now seeking to exploit for new diagnostic approaches. Many COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure and sometimes death. COVID-19 pneumonia is different from more common forms of bacterial pneumonia, and the differences show up in chest CT scans. Most striking are cloudy lesion patterns that resemble shards of glass or reticular lines within the opaque lesions that look like irregular paving tiles, which occur around the peripheries of both lungs. Lesions from bacterial pneumonia are usually concentrated in one lung and may not resemble shards of glass. 
In China, CT scans are already used as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool when a patient arrives at a healthcare setting with fever and a suspected infection, though this approach has not been widely adopted in the United States. Two studies, published in Nature Medicine and Cell, advance this idea by using artificial intelligence (AI) trained on CT lung scans as a quick diagnostic tool to look for COVID-19 infection in patients who come to the hospital and require medical imaging.
See “AI Is Screening Billions of Molecules for Coronavirus Treatments”
Writing in Cell, researchers at Macau University of Science and Technology used 532,000 CT scans from 3,777 patients in China to train their AI tools, focusing on the tell-tale lesions seen in COVID-19 patient lungs. In pilot studies at several Chinese hospitals the AI model correctly diagnosed pneumonia caused by the coronavirus at least 85 percent of the time when it was applied to a dataset of 417 patients in four separate cohorts. COVID pneumonia was misdiagnosed as non-COVID pneumonia in 7–12 percent of cases. 
“This group does a tremendous job of a deep-dive on external validation: they have this large dataset from China and they looked at how it performed in many hospitals,” says Matthew Lungren, a radiologist at Stanford University Medical Center who was not involved in either study. 
Recognizing a very small number of COVID-19 pneumonia cases out of a large number of non-specific general pneumonia cases is important for a diagnostic tool when SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the pandemic, becomes endemic and is no longer the leading cause of pneumonia, Lungren explains. 
“A large dataset with a diverse source of data is crucial to achieve robust and generalizable conclusions in AI based diagnoses,” writes Cell coauthor Kang Zhang, a professor of medicine at Macau University of Science and Technology, in an email to The Scientist. “One of the most challenging issues in AI application in healthcare is poor reproducibility.”
One challenge of using CT scans for COVID-19 diagnosis is that a lot of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience severe clinical symptoms such as cough and fever, but have no biomarkers visible in the CT scans. If healthcare professionals are trying to get an accurate COVID-19 diagnosis faster than standard PCR methods, “only basing [COVID-19 diagnosis] on imaging may not be enough,” says Yang Yang, a radiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital.
Yang’s team also trained its COVID-19 AI model on CT chest scans and published the results in Nature Medicine. This model integrated results of the CT scans with clinical findings such as patients’ ages, whether they had a cough or fever, and their white blood cell counts, creating what the authors called a “fusion model” to diagnose patients with COVID-19 based on clinical and imaging data. Their fusion model diagnosed COVID-19 with 83.5 percent accuracy in a test set of 279 patients. When looking at the same set of images, a senior thoracic radiologist diagnosed COVID-19 with 84.6 percent accuracy. 
“There are aspects to their methodology which I think are very important for this field in general,” says Lungren, namely, many AI diagnostic models based upon imaging data would benefit from the input of additional clinical data.  
Zhang says at least 10 large hospitals in China, and several in the US, India, Iraq, and Ecuador are using his model to diagnose patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia. His team made its algorithms and training datasets publicly available for other researchers to use.

Two Genetic Regions Linked with Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,
KRULUA
I
t’s not yet clear why some people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, get really sick, while others have only mild symptoms. There’s some evidence that chronic health conditions—such as hypertension and diabetes can play a role, and scientists know that people’s genes can influence how their bodies react to other viruses. In a preprint posted to medRxiv on June 2, researchers describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of samples from 1,610 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 2,205 healthy controls. The authors identified variants in two regions—the locus that encodes blood type and a multi-gene cluster on chromosome 3—that were linked to respiratory failure during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
“We know that people vary in their susceptibility to infectious diseases, and variation in the human genome plays a . . . role in that susceptibility,” Charlotte Houldcroft, who studies interactions between viruses and hosts at the University of Cambridge and was not involved in the work, writes in an email to The Scientist. “A genome-wide association study is a very good way to look at lots of variants across the human genome all at once, without a preconceived idea about which genes might be involved.”
Each variant found here only increases a person’s risk a little bit, and we have no idea how.
—Charlotte Houldcroft, University of Cambridge
Finding anything meaningful in a GWAS depends upon having enough genomes to analyze. In a pandemic, that’s especially tricky. According to Andre Franke, a geneticist at Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel in Germany, it was the connections that his colleague Tom Hemming Karlsen, a physician-scientist at the University of Oslo in Norway, has to clinicians and researchers in COVID-19 hot spots in Spain and Italy that made the study possible. 
See “DNA Could Hold Clues to Varying Severity of COVID-19”
The research team collected, genotyped, and analyzed samples from 775 patients and 950 controls from Spain and 835 patients and 1,255 controls from Italy. The patients were all hospitalized and were either in need of mechanical ventilation or on supplemental oxygen, both of which the researchers categorized as respiratory failure. They pulled out two genomic regions in which certain variants showed up more in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 than in unhospitalized people from the same geographic region.
Ideally, a GWAS analysis would analyze the genomes of people with COVID-19 and compare those who didn’t get very sick to those who experienced severe symptoms, instead of using population-based controls whose exposure to the virus is unknown, says Priya Duggal, a genetic epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who did not participate in the study. Nevertheless, “it’s really incredible to see how much work was done in such a short period of time. In about two months, these investigators moved from cases being identified in the hospitals to being genotyped to the identification of two putative regions.”
One region the authors identified is the locus that encodes blood type. They found that people with blood type A were at a higher risk for respiratory failure, while blood group O seemed to be protective. The odds for those with blood type A to be hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms were nearly 1.5 times the odds for people with other blood types. And those with type O had about two-thirds the odds of being hospitalized as those with other blood types. This analysis echoes preprint findings from patient datasets collected in China and New York, which Franke says makes the research team more confident that it’s a real association.
The other genomic region the researchers identified shows up on the human chromosome 3 and contains several genes of interest. One is SLC6A20, which encodes an amino acid transporter that interacts with ACE2, the main receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get into human cells. Two other genes in this cluster encode immune system–related chemokine receptors: the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 and the CC-motif chemokine receptor 9. Both proteins play a role in T cell differentiation and recruitment during influenza viral infections. This region also shows up in publicly available results from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, which gives it weight, the authors write.
“Chemokine receptors are important in many manifestations of multiple diseases, so that’s interesting,” says Benjamin Fairfax, a geneticist at the University of Oxford who did not participate in the study. He adds that the SLC6A20 association is also intriguing because of the interaction with ACE2, but that the findings for both the chromosome 3 and blood group loci need to be replicated to give more insight into the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.
“From the individual perspective of a patient or those people wandering around with blood group A who may think they’re at higher risk, these effect sizes are going to be very, very small compared to major risk factors such as age and sex,” Fairfax says.
The gene cluster on chromosome 3 has an even higher effect size than that of the ABO locus, says Franke, “but we cannot say at the moment which of the many candidate genes is most important. All of them are very attractive in this region.” The odds of being hospitalized with respiratory failure from COVID-19 were 1.77 times higher for those with the variants on chromosome 3 than for people without this genotype.
See “Alzheimer’s Gene Linked to Higher Risk of Severe COVID-19”
“Each variant found here only increases a person’s risk a little bit, and we have no idea how,” Houldcroft says. “It doesn’t allow us to predict who will be a severe case, and it doesn’t open up any treatment options. However, it does give us a plausible place to start looking.”
The work is “a really good first step,” says Duggal. “I hope that what follows is some additional studies from other groups and researchers that are able to evaluate what else may be driving this or what these genetic associations might actually mean.”

Surgisphere Fallout Hits African Nonprofit’s COVID-19 Efforts/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 
FIVEPOINTSIX
Update (June 8): Surgisphere’s online COVID-19 Response Center and the four web tools hosted on it have been taken down from the company’s website.
A
nonprofit organization in Africa that promoted a tool to help clinicians determine how to allocate limited medical resources among COVID-19 patients is walking back its recommendations in the wake of a scandal involving the company that collaborated on the project.
Surgisphere Corporation, an Illinois-based company founded in 2008 by vascular surgeon Sapan Desai, has come under fire in recent days for failing to obtain independent validation for datasets used in two high-profile studies in The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Both papers are now retracted.
The Lancet study, which reported safety concerns about the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus patients, led the World Health Organization to suspend part of a clinical trial. Testing resumed last week once scientists began to express doubts about the veracity of the data, and reports by The Scientist and other outlets exposed serious concerns about the company.
Originally a producer of medical textbooks, Surgisphere has seen its profile as a data analytics company soar since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with the African Federation for Emergency Medicine (AFEM), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting medical care across the continent, Surgisphere developed a COVID-19 Severity Scoring Tool to help clinicians decide how to allocate limited resources such as oxygen and mechanical ventilators to patients who need them most.
In the last couple of months, AFEM has promoted the tool for use in 26 countries across Africa (although The Scientist could not determine how many clinicians are currently using it), and several institutions had been set to launch validation studies of the tool in clinical settings. Those activities have all been halted following the retractions and a stream of questions about Surgisphere and Desai himself.
The people who will suffer . . . are African patients. That is the unfortunate reality now, regardless of the outcome of the (totally necessary) investigations into Surgisphere.
—Lee Wallis, African Federation for Emergency Medicine
In a statement posted June 5, AFEM announced that it recommends clinicians stop using the tool. “We recognise that we have promoted the use of this tool, and are embarrassed that these findings surrounding Surgisphere have led to our needing to rescind this resource,” the statement reads.
“Over the last decade, AFEM has worked with healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers throughout the continent to expand emergency care,” the statement continues. “We have built a reputation of developing these systems through informed, evidence-based recommendations, and we deeply regret that this was not one of them.”
A collaboration to aid Africa’s pandemic response
In phone interviews and email correspondence with The Scientist, AFEM’s founding president Lee Wallis says he reached out to Surgisphere about developing a clinical aid for local doctors a few months ago, after discovering the company online.
“Dr Desai was explicit that he didn’t need the company logo associated with it, and had no expectation even of us acknowledging his involvement,” Wallis tells The Scientist in an email. “[Desai] never asked for any endorsements or any other form of benefit, and has repeatedly expressed that he simply wanted to do this to help the response to the pandemic.”
According to Surgisphere, the company then developed the Severity Scoring Tool using advanced machine learning algorithms and the firm’s database of thousands of COVID-19 patients.
The validity of that database has been called into question in recent weeks by hundreds of scientists who say the numbers of patients from various continents don’t seem to add up. In the Lancet paper, for instance, Surgisphere claimed to have amassed data on more than 63,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in North America by April 14. But some of the largest health networks in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois—among the states worst hit by the pandemic—tell The Scientist they did not contribute to the company’s database. Multiple institutions once listed on Surgisphere’s website as collaborators have confirmed to The Scientist that they have no records of working with the company.

By April, AFEM had developed a paper version of the Severity Scoring Tool—which guides clinicians through a series of questions about their patients to predict the severity of each case—specifically for use in low-resource areas, and publicized the web version via their website. The ministries of health in Sudan and Tanzania had incorporated the tool into official clinical guidelines, Wallis says. The organization also secured approval from the relevant ethics committees to carry out validation studies with the tool in Sudan and South Africa. Data collection was due to start in the coming week.
In conversations with The Scientist a few days ago, Wallis, who is also on the board of directors for the International Federation for Emergency Medicine, noted the need for caution in rejecting the paper version of the tool, which he and his collaborators had poured resources into and were hoping to see through validation studies. He added that informal tests with the tool seemed to show it working well.
However, now that the coauthors of Surgisphere’s two published studies have retracted them after failing to receive evidence of the validity of the company’s database, the organization is left with no choice but to withdraw its recommendations and the planned studies, Wallis tells The Scientist.
Surgisphere’s COVID-19 Severity Scoring Tool: “It was not credible”
The Severity Scoring Tool is one of a handful of so-called “decision support tools” freely available on Surgisphere’s website as part of its COVID-19 Response Center.
To use the web application, a clinician has to enter details about a patient’s symptoms and underlying health, and then click to receive a prediction. The paper version walks clinicians through a decision tree of questions about whether or not a patient has certain underlying health conditions, and whether their vital signs are above or below a certain threshold. The patient criteria to be included in the tool were suggested by AFEM, but the structure of the tree, and the thresholds themselves, were set by Surgisphere.
Surgisphere has declined to release details about any of its COVID-19 support tools in response to multiple requests from The Scientist, and Desai declined to comment on this story through the public relations firm Bliss Integrated.
According to Wallis, Desai said the Severity Scoring Tool had been developed using advanced machine learning methods on data from 13,500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients—a claim repeated in Wallis’s editorial on the tool in the African Journal of Emergency Medicine in early April. He says Desai also told him the tool had been validated on around 45,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A March 26 press release from Surgisphere states that the tool was developed using “prospectively collected real time data on more than 20,000 COVID-19 patients.”
Desai further claimed in his communication with Wallis that the machine learning algorithms behind the online version would be automatically refined as Surgisphere’s database continued to grow.
Given that the Severity Scoring Tool was initially derived using data from Surgisphere, these data being called into question also calls into question our tool.
—African Federation for Emergency Medicine
Around the same time, Desai sent information about the tool to researchers preparing a review article in The BMJ. Maarten van Smeden, a coauthor of the review and a medical statistician at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, and colleagues have been keeping track of predictive tools in use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Van Smeden tells The Scientist that his team reached out to Surgisphere Corporation in March and again in April to request information about how its COVID-19 response tools worked.
In documents seen by The Scientist, Desai told the team that the Severity Scoring Tool had been developed using data from 14,390 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and validated with data from an additional 42,340. He added that the full Surgisphere registry by April 12 contained data from 70,361 patients from more than 800 healthcare institutions. (According to the now-retracted Lancet paper, the registry contained 96,032 patients from 671 institutions by April 14.)
He further told the BMJ authors that the Severity Scoring Tool had already been used by “250,000 people from 114 countries.”
The numbers didn’t add up at that stage in the pandemic, van Smeden tells The Scientist. Considering the lack of detail in the documents’ description of development and validation, he found the whole thing “incredible,” he says. “As in, it was not credible.” The authors chose not to describe Surgisphere’s tool in their review, the latest version of which was published on June 3.
How the online tool works
The code behind Surgisphere’s Severity Scoring Tool is accessible via the HTML version of the company’s website, and contains the rules the application implements to predict a severity score of “moderate/mild,” “severe,” or “critical” on the basis of inputs such as age and heart rate.
Multiple researchers who work with machine learning tell The Scientist that, because the rules underlying the tool are hard-coded—that is, all of the steps and parameters are written out—it would be very difficult to have the application automatically update itself, as Wallis had been led to believe by Desai.
“Every time you get new data, you’d have to go in and change those numbers, or the structure of the code,” says James Watson, a senior scientist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand who organized two open letters expressing concerns about Surgisphere’s studies. “That would just be clearly the wrong way of doing it. No one would do it like that.”
A version log tracking “major updates and changes” to the Severity Scoring Tool doesn’t show any entries after March 31, although it’s not clear whether smaller changes were made after that.
Andrew Forbes, a biostatistician at Monash University in Melbourne, notes that the application also seems to collect data without any attempt at validating the accuracy of what’s being entered. After filling out the Severity Scoring Tool online and clicking to receive the score, a pop-up box asks the user to confirm whether or not the prediction was accurate, and states that, provided the user consents, “The data you entered will become part of our more than 13,000 patients and help improve the quality of this severity scoring system.”
The availability of this option raises serious questions about the quality of data collected by the application, Forbes writes in an email to The Scientist. “I am surprised that anyone accessing this publicly available tool can have their ‘data’ contributing to their database based on their inputs from the web page, regardless of whether the data entered are real or not.”  
He adds that he would caution against clinical use of predictive tools that aren’t accompanied by clear descriptions of how they were developed and validated, and by information about the data sources used to create them.
Other applications on the website have also come under scrutiny after scientists began sharing their impressions of them on Twitter. The Diagnosis tool, for example, estimates that a person with a fever and a five-day “interval to respiratory symptoms” has a less-than-2-percent probability of COVID-19 infection. Changing five days to six days increases that probability to more than 98 percent. Ticking a box that says “sore throat” reduces the probability back to less than 2 percent.
AFEM’s response to criticism of Surgisphere
In early June, following negative press coverage of Surgisphere Corporation, clinicians in African hospitals started reaching out to Wallis to say they were uncomfortable using the tool, he tells The Scientist. As questions about Surgisphere’s dataset continued to build, AFEM responded publicly with a statement about the Severity Scoring Tool on its website on June 4.
“We have been made aware of controversies related to Surgisphere Corporation, including recent articles published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine using their data,” the statement reads. “Alongside our colleagues in the scientific community, we hope that these questions are resolved swiftly and satisfactorily by those involved in the studies.”
The next day, after both The Lancet and NEJM issued retractions, AFEM issued a second statement recommending that hospitals stop using the aid. “Given that the Severity Scoring Tool was initially derived using data from Surgisphere, these data being called into question also calls into question our tool,” the statement reads. “The AFEM team has undertaken urgent discussions to make the safest, most ethical decision regarding the use of the tool.” The paper version and the link to the online version have both been removed from AFEM’s website.
Now, Wallis says, the organization is focused on trying to help teams transition away from using the tool. The group recommends in its statement that clinicians follow the World Health Organization’s guidelines for now, and says it intends to proceed with “original research to develop a robust, evidence-based tool to help clinicians in understanding likely resource requirements of patients presenting to emergency units with potential COVID-19 disease.”
The organization plans to start work right away, Wallis says, but it’s going to take months to develop and test a new tool. He expresses concern that the association with Surgisphere could damage trust in AFEM, and threaten future efforts to develop clinical tools for use in African countries. “The people who will suffer due to that are African patients,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. “That is the unfortunate reality now, regardless of the outcome of the (totally necessary) investigations into Surgisphere. There is no good result for us or our patients in that context.”

homas Kunz, a mammalogist at Boston University who studied and advocated for bats, died April 13 from complications associated with COVID-19. He was 81.
Kunz was born in Independence, Missouri, on June 11, 1938. He received a bachelor’s in biology in 1961 and master’s in education in 1962 from Central Missouri State College. He went on to receive a master’s from Drake University in biology in 1968.
After earning a PhD from the University of Kansas in systematics and ecology in 1971, Kunz joined the faculty in the Department of Biology at Boston University. He remained there until 2011, when injuries from a car accident forced him to retire from academic duties.
Kunz studied the ecology and population dynamics of bats in the United States, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Trinidad, India, and Malaysia. He used thermal infrared imaging to count bats in colonies and track flight patterns.
A popular figure on campus, Kunz was known affectionately as Bat Man. In 2011, Kunz told BU Today the nickname “gives me the opportunity to tout the value of these misunderstood and often unappreciated animals.” Although bats are maligned for hosting zoonotic viruses such as coronaviruses, Kunz argued they provide vital ecosystem services, from eating large quantities of disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes, to pollinating economically important plants.
Kunz was especially well known for his studies on white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease first discovered in 2007. The disease wakes bats early from hibernation, damages their wings, and leads to a fatal depletion of their fat reserves. In 2010, he predicted white nose syndrome would cause the regional extinction of little brown bats within 16 years. Kunz testified in US House committee hearings and sat on Bat Conservation International’s planning committee to develop strategies against white nose syndrome.
During his 40-year academic career, Kunz authored or coauthored more than 280 peer-reviewed papers. He was president of the American Society of Mammalogists from 2000 to 2002, receiving honorary membership in 2008. He was also elected Fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science.
In a statement to the American Society of Mammalogists, society president Douglas Kelt, biologist at the University of California, Davis, described Kunz as “a giant of mammalogy . . . a disarmingly gentle, kind, and caring person.”
Kunz is survived by his wife Margaret, his daughter Pamela Kunz and son-in-law Jeffrey Kwan, son David Kunz and daughter-in-law Nicole, and grandchildren Oliver, Eliot, and Austin Kwan, and Jackson and Grey Kunz.

wo controversial studies of COVID-19 patients have been retracted after the authors failed to demonstrate that the data were reliable. The first study to be retracted, published last month (May 22) in The Lancet, had found harmful effects associated with the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, but quickly drew fire after scientists raised questions about the massive database supposedly underpinning it, and about that database’s owner, Surgisphere Corporation.
Today, three authors—all the coauthors on the study except Surgisphere founder and CEO Sapan Desai—contacted The Lancet to retract their report. “They were unable to complete an independent audit of the data underpinning their analysis,” the retraction notice in The Lancet reads. “As a result, they have concluded that they ‘can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources.’”
The three coauthors are Mandeep Mehra, the medical director of Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, Frank Ruschitzka of University Hospital Zurich, and Amit Patel of the University of Utah.
In a joint statement published on The Lancet’s website, they write that a set of independent peer reviewers “informed us that Surgisphere would not transfer the full dataset, client contracts, and the full ISO [International Organization for Standardization] audit report to their servers for analysis as such transfer would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements. As such, our reviewers were not able to conduct an independent and private peer review and therefore notified us of their withdrawal from the peer-review process.”
They continue: “We all entered this collaboration to contribute in good faith and at a time of great need during the COVID-19 pandemic. We deeply apologise to you, the editors, and the journal readership for any embarrassment or inconvenience that this may have caused.”
Shortly after The Lancet’s retraction, NEJM issued its own retraction. The authors’ statement reads: “Because all the authors were not granted access to the raw data and the raw data could not be made available to a third-party auditor, we are unable to validate the primary data sources underlying our article. . . . We therefore request that the article be retracted. We apologize to the editors and to readers of the Journal for the difficulties that this has caused.”
Hundreds of scientists have raised questions about the provenance of Surgisphere’s dataset. The Scientist reached out to some of the largest health systems in the states hit hardest by COVID-19, but could not find any that contributed data to Surgisphere, and the company has declined to name any participants, citing privacy agreements.
Several institutions once listed as collaborators on Surgisphere’s website, including the University of Minnesota and Stanford University, tell The Scientist they have no record of anyone at their institutions working with Surgisphere. The mentions of the collaborations have since been removed from Surgisphere’s website.
Surgisphere’s studies have contributed to shaping the global pandemic response. The World Health Organization and other health groups, for instance, had suspended testing of hydroxychloroquine in response to the Lancet paper, although the WHO has since reinstated the study.

As the Pandemic Hits Campus Finances, Faculty Face Layoffs/-/ABOVE: The union representing faculty members at the City University of New York held a protest in response to announced layoffs.

n May 15, Mark Lucas received a phone call that left him numb. After 21 years as a physics professor at Ohio University, he received notice that after the next school year, his contract would no longer be renewed. “I’m within 10 years of retiring,” Lucas says. “Given the current situation, I have no idea what the job market will be like.”
Lucas was not alone. Citing ongoing budget challenges that were heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the university sent out non-renewal notices to 53 members of its faculty.
We expect the situation for the next one or two fiscal years to be very challenging.
—John Hoey, University of Massachusetts
The pandemic has bored holes in budgets at universities and colleges across the US and beyond. To stem the spread of the coronavirus, higher education institutions shuttered their campuses, sent students home, and moved classes online. As a result, schools have lost millions of dollars in revenue—and many expect further losses due to the uncertainly about whether the 2020–21 school year can convene on campus this fall.
“All colleges and universities have been affected by the pandemic. Most are facing a serious cash flow crisis,” says Terry Hartle, the senior vice president of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents. “The vast majority of college and university presidents are worried about fall enrollment and the financial viability of their institutions.”
See “Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19”
To deal with this financial strain, many universities have started to reduce their workforces. According to a list kept by The Chronicle of Higher Education, at least 48,086 employees (faculty and other staff) across 190 US institutions have been affected by a COVID-19–related layoff, contract non-renewal, or furlough (a temporary unpaid leave of absence). Some institutions, such as Urbana University in Ohio, have permanently shuttered their doors.
Widespread losses
In a letter sent to faculty and students in April, Ohio University President Duane Nellis detailed the financial effects of the pandemic on the institution: more than $18 million in revenue was lost due to the need to refund students for housing, dining, and parking costs, as well as canceled athletics, summer camps, and study abroad programs. As a public university, Ohio University also receives funding from the state, and Nellis noted that his institution was expecting a 20 percent reduction in state funding. That amounts to approximately $8 million in losses in the current fiscal year (FY2020), and $35 million in the next.
Other universities are also expecting significant shortfalls. The University of Arizona, which announced furloughs and pay cuts for faculty and staff in April, projects that the pandemic will result in a $66 million loss in FY2020, for which the institution had earlier estimated a $37 million surplus from its $2.2 billion budget. Meanwhile, when the University of Missouri, which had a $3.5 billion budget in FY2020,  announced layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts in May, it stated that cuts to state funding amounted to a $17 million reduction this year, plus an additional, unspecified amount of lost revenue due to refunds to students.
Johns Hopkins University, a private institution whose researchers have played a key role in COVID-19 tracking efforts, expects a net loss of $100 million in FY2020—the institution had initially expected a net surplus of $72 million in its $6.5 billion budget—and up to a $375 million loss in FY2021. This is due to a variety of lost income sources, including tuition and other student-related revenue and clinical revenue from faculty physicians. In a message published in April, the university’s president, Ronald Daniels, wrote that furloughs and layoffs “are regrettably expected to be necessary within some units of the university as an unavoidable consequence of the losses we are experiencing.”
See “Furloughs and Pay Cuts Announced for U of Arizona Employees”
Some of the hardest-hit institutions, such as Ohio University, were already experiencing budget difficulties prior to the pandemic. “The faculty and staff position eliminations were responsive to both budget challenges we faced prior to the pandemic as a result of shifting enrollments, as well as the global crisis, which has made it necessary for our administration to respond with even more urgency,” Carly Leatherwood, the senior director of communication services at Ohio University, writes in an email to The Scientist.
The CARES Act, a $2 trillion stimulus bill passed in March by the US federal government to address the economic fallout of the pandemic, earmarked approximately $7 billion for higher education institutions to deal with pandemic-related losses and another $7 billion for affected students. “Did it help? Yes, absolutely,” Hartle says. “Was it enough to help institutions avoid a potential catastrophe? No, not yet.”
An uncertain future
The Professional Staff Congress, the union representing faculty at CUNY, demonstrated in response to announcements that the university system would be laying off faculty members and cutting courses.
NINA WESTERVELT
Like Lucas, Maria Mellone, an associate lecturer in the mathematics department at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Boston, received a non-reappointment notice in mid-May. Mellone, however, doesn’t have a year to look for a new position as her contract ends this semester.
According to Steve Striffler, the director of the Labor Resource Center at UMass Boston and the president of the Faculty Staff Union, approximately 350 non-tenure-track faculty members at UMass Boston received the same notice. In a letter sent to Mellone and others, the university’s interim provost, Emily McDermott, states the university intends “not to appoint or reappoint any associate lectures or clinical associate lecturers for the Fall 2020 semester,” but adds that rehires may be possible once the budgetary outlook becomes clear.
One of Mellone’s biggest concerns is her son’s tuition at UMass Boston. As the child of a staff member, he receives tuition assistance. Without that financial support, Mellone says, “I don’t know if he’s going to be able to go to college next semester.” The possibility of rehire is “not reassuring,” she adds. “I have to look for another job.”
John Hoey, the executive director of communications at UMass—which is made up of five campuses—says that the university system lost approximately $123 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. He adds that UMass expects to end the fiscal year with a balanced budget due to cost-cutting measures such as furloughs as well as federal funding provided by the CARES Act. “We were in a decent position to respond to the issue in this fiscal year,” Hoey says. “We expect the situation for the next one or two fiscal years to be very challenging.” Variables such as student enrollment, federal aid, and costs associated with reopening campuses will determine what university finances look like in the coming years, he adds.
There are ongoing efforts to urge universities to stop layoffs. After the City University of New York (CUNY), which includes 25 campuses across New York City, announced that it would be firing faculty and slashing course offerings, the Professional Staff Congress (PSC), the union representing its faculty, published an open letter to the university president demanding an immediate end to the cuts. In addition, the PSC has run TV ads and staged a socially distant protest to draw attention to their demands. “We feel that . . . first of all, they should really freeze and rescind these cutbacks and layoffs, and they should be looking to the state and to the federal government to fund the university,” says Andrea Vásquez, first vice president of the PSC. CUNY did not respond to The Scientist’s requests for comment.
At Ohio University, both students and staff have spoken out against the staff layoffs. For example, the student-organized movement #SaveOUrProfs has been actively advocating on social media for faculty layoffs to end. Lucas is not optimistic about his chances of rehire—instead, he’s planning to look for a new job. He says he hopes to keep teaching, but he’s also prepared to pivot to a more technology-focused position, such as programming. “My gut says there are a number of people like me out there, and the positions are dwindling,” Lucas says. “It pains me to realize that I might not be teaching anymore.”
Researchers in Brazil Struggle to Get Solid COVID-19 Death Counts/-/ABOVE: Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil

razil is a major new epicenter of COVID-19—but the official figures don’t tell the whole story. That’s what researchers have concluded after combing through public death notice data from the second most-populous state in the country and comparing it to officially reported figures. 
A team of scientists examined data gleaned from public notary death notices—legal documents required for arranging a burial—in Minas Gerais state and published their results in a preprint on medRxiv May 23. They found that notaries recorded 201 COVID-19 deaths in March and April, versus 65 COVID-19 deaths reported in official statistics via a government system called The Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). There is generally a lag between these data sources, but the team also found that notaries had recorded an unexpected surge of deaths due to other respiratory illnesses. The authors write that they suspect hundreds of these are in fact additional coronavirus deaths, likely attributed instead to conditions caused by COVID-19, such as pneumonia.
They also argue that Brazil is not testing for COVID-19 widely enough in order to understand the scale of the epidemic and to make decisions on policies such as social distancing. Despite this lack of data, lockdown measures are already being relaxed in Minas Gerais, says coauthor Tafarel Andrade de Souza, a postdoc in health science in the School of Medicine at the Federal University of Uberlândia.
I know for a fact that the excess exists and COVID is causing a ton more deaths than historically expected.
—Flávio Codeço Coelho, Fundação Getúlio Vargas
“We are facing the gradual opening of workplaces and public parks,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. “This worries us.”
He and his colleagues found that public notaries in Minas Gerais had recorded a very large number of deaths caused by severe respiratory symptoms, labelled generically as “SARS” in the notary dataset. Between 2017 and 2019, such deaths averaged around no more than 20 per week during March and April but this year they surged to more than 80 per week at times. There was also an increase of about 5–6 percent in the number of deaths related to pneumonia and “respiratory insufficiency” in the same period this year compared to previous years.
Brazil’s Ministry of Health did not respond to a request for comment.
The robustness of the SINAN system has been scrutinized by epidemiologists in the past. An analysis published in 2008 in Leprosy Review found that, while the SINAN software used by health professionals was functional, there were “serious weaknesses” in terms of, for example, staffing, which meant the quality and timeliness of data reporting were lower than expected.
More recently, in 2016, Flávio Codeço Coelho, a professor of mathematical epidemiology at Fundação Getúlio Vargas and colleagues criticized the functionality of SINAN in The Lancet. They pointed out that it only provides monthly data, which they argued is not good enough for accurate disease modelling. Because of this and other problems, SINAN, they said, risked “complete obsolescence.”
Coelho, who was not involved in the preprint, notes that, pre-pandemic, there was always a lag between the notary data and the figures in SINAN, which are confirmed by health officials and take longer to be updated. In other words, the SINAN data may eventually square more closely with the notary records. 
But notary records have their own problems. Coelho, says that notary documents are not always medically rigorous. “Sometimes what’s written as a cause of death for that certificate, it’s not necessarily a valid assessment from the point of view of medicine,” he says.
See “It’s So Hard to Know Who’s Dying of COVID-19—and When”
Coelho adds that the challenges presented by the rising death toll during the pandemic and variation between data sources mean researchers can only obtain a broad impression of what is happening.
Felipe Iani, a bioinformatics graduate student at Ezequiel Dias Foundation, also stresses that SINAN data are gradually updated and might become more accurate over time. He adds that Brazil is undoubtedly facing a serious outbreak of COVID-19. 
To take another example of the discrepancies that exist in Brazil’s COVID-19 death count, the advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) recorded more than 125 deaths among indigenous groups by May 24 and a death rate double that of the wider population. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry’s Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health had only recorded 34 deaths by that date.
Coelho says that the preprint by de Souza and colleagues cannot conclusively reveal the true number of COVID-19 deaths in Minas Gerais but he adds that the general findings concur with his own analysis of deaths in Brazil in 2020 versus previous years. 
“I know for a fact that the excess exists and COVID is causing a ton more deaths than historically expected,” he says.
Some states including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have been hit especially hard, with more than 10,000 deaths already between them.
Observers outside Brazil are using what data are available to make projections as to how the country will fare in the coming weeks and months. The picture is a disturbing one. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation recently projected that more than 125,000 COVID-19 deaths will have occurred in Brazil by August 4.
As of June 3, the officially reported death toll stands at 31,300.
Correction (June 4): We misidentified de Souza as a graduate student. He is a postdoc. The Scientist regrets the error.
Paleobotanist Brian Axsmith Dies/-/UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA
B
rian Axsmith, a paleobotanist at the University of South Alabama who discovered many significant fossils in the southeastern United States, died May 5 from complications associated with COVID-19. He was 57.
Axsmith was born in Stowe, PA, and raised in suburban Philadelphia. His sister Doreen Axsmith Inmon tells FOX10 he had a love of dinosaurs and paleontology from an early age. In an email to The Scientist, Timothy Sherman, a biologist at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, says Axsmith specifically became interested in Mesozoic plant fossils after finding them near his hometown in the Newark Basin when he was an undergraduate student.
Axsmith received a bachelor’s degree in biology from Millersville University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate in botany from the University of Kansas in 1998. Following postdoctoral training at the same institution, Axsmith took a job at the University of South Alabama in Mobile in 1999, where he was a professor of biology until his death.
“He had been doing a lot of work reinvigorating paleobotany down in the southeastern US, where some of the last publications had come out in 1918,” Dana Ehret, a curator at the New Jersey State Museum, tells The Scientist. Ehret says Axsmith rediscovered some of these old fossil sites in Alabama and Mississippi and resumed excavating them, discovering new specimens and species. His research focus was Pliocene flora from the Citronelle Formation local to Mobile.
Some of Axsmith’s most significant discoveries included the fossilized pollen and needles of the eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) in Alabama and Mississippi. Currently, the species is only found in the northeastern United States and Canada. Axsmith also uncovered the earliest known post-Eocene fossil record of ironwood trees in North America. 
Axsmith also discovered fossilized wingnuts (Pterocarya) in the Citronelle rock formation in Mobile County, Alabama. Present-day wingnut species are only found in Asia, but Axsmith’s find indicated that the species once existed in the southeastern United States as well. In 2019, a genus of plant fossils, Axsmithia, from the Triassic of Antarctica, was named in his honor. 
Ehret recalls the infectious enthusiasm with which Axsmith performed fieldwork. “Working with him out in the field, he was a big guy, but he would be swinging a pickaxe over his head for hours on end, pulling all these fossil specimens out of the sediments. You could see that childlike fascination with him.”
Students at the University of South Alabama, where Axsmith taught evolutionary biology, remember him as a fun and engaging lecturer. “He challenged you to think—regardless of what you thought about evolution. He is one of those if I could just sit there and listen to him hours on end—I would do it. He was very intriguing,” Charlie Crabtree, a former student, tells FOX10.
Axsmith is survived by his wife Jennifer, son Jeffrey, and sister Doreen.
Concerns Build Over Surgisphere’s COVID-19 Dataset/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WHYFRAMESTUDIO
Update (June 3): The World Health Organization today announced that it would be resuming hydroxychloroquine testing in its Solidarity Trial, following widespread criticism of The Lancet paper and the dataset it was based on. 
S
cientists are questioning the validity of two influential studies of COVID-19 patients as concerns grow about the provenance of the dataset underpinning them. Despite assurances from Surgisphere Corporation, an Illinois-based company that owns the data, hundreds of researchers have now signed open letters to The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), voicing their concerns. Today, NEJM and The Lancet issued expressions of concern about the reliability of the papers’ conclusions.
“Recently, substantive concerns have been raised about the quality of the information in that database,” writes NEJM editor-in-chief Eric Rubin in the expression of concern. “We have asked the authors to provide evidence that the data are reliable. In the interim and for the benefit of our readers, we are publishing this Expression of Concern about the reliability of their conclusions.”
A number of hospitals in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois tell The Scientist they did not contribute to Surgisphere’s dataset. 
A statement by The Lancet editors reads: “Although an independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data has been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere and is ongoing, with results expected very shortly, we are issuing an Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention. We will update this notice as soon as we have further information.”
Both studies relied on Surgisphere Corporation’s database, which the papers state contains COVID-19 patient data from hundreds of hospitals around the world. A third paper from Surgisphere, which described the effects of the drug ivermectin in COVID-19 patients, was posted as a preprint in April. 
The studies’ findings have influenced research and policy, with the World Health Organization recently suspending testing of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine over safety concerns reported in the Lancet study. Regulatory agencies in the UK and in France have also suspended recruitment into clinical trials of the drug in COVID-19 patients.
See “WHO Halts Hydroxychloroquine Study Over Safety Concerns”
The search for sources of Surgisphere’s COVID-19 data
Scientists are expressing doubts that Surgisphere Corporation could have collected so much detailed patient data in such a short period of time. The open letter to the NEJM requests that, “at the very minimum, [Surgisphere should share] the aggregated patient data at the hospital level (for all covariates and outcomes).”
The Lancet study reported that Surgisphere’s registry contained data from more than 63,000 COVID-19 patients admitted to 559 hospitals in North America by April 14. By that date, around 580,000 total cases had been reported in the United States, with New York and New Jersey accounting for nearly half of them. 
Surgisphere CEO and founder Sapan Desai has so far declined to release the names of any hospitals involved in providing the data, citing pre-arranged privacy agreements. 
The Scientist has reached out to some of the largest health systems in the states hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic to inquire whether they participated, but could not find any that did. 
Instead, a number of hospitals confirmed that they did not contribute data, namely, New Jersey health systems RJWBarnabas Health, Cooper Health, and Atlantic Health System; NYC Health + Hospitals and NYU Langone in New York; and Illinois-based health systems Rush and Advocate Health Care. 
Northwest Community Hospital, which employed Desai as a vascular surgeon until February 10 this year, did not contribute data, it confirms in an email to The Scientist. Nor did coauthor Mendeep Mehra’s institution, Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
In an interview last week, Desai told The Scientist that he would ask if any hospitals were willing to come forward voluntarily to confirm their participation, but has not provided any names yet.
Desai continues to stand by Surgisphere’s registry, saying in a statement to The Scientist that “it is essential that the scientific and lay community alike understand the value—and legitimacy—of databases such as Surgisphere’s.”
See “Disputed Hydroxychloroquine Study Brings Scrutiny to Surgisphere”
A growing list of discrepancies
The Lancet study’s full dataset included 96,032 patients admitted to 671 hospitals across six continents by April 14. Of those patients, 10,698 had died in hospital by April 21, the study reported.
Readers have argued that the data presented in these papers don’t jibe with reported numbers of COVID-19 patients. For example, researchers at Australian institutions told the The Guardian last week (May 28) that the number of Australian deaths in the Lancet paper, counted up until April 21, exceeded the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded by health authorities up until that date. 
Desai told the Guardian that this was due to an error that caused one hospital in Asia to be included in the Australian dataset, but didn’t provide any further detail about country-level or hospital-level data. The Lancet subsequently published a correction from the authors with the amended Australian data, and with an added table that included continent-level raw data, instead of the adjusted data Desai said had been shown previously. 
I am confident Surgisphere is able to address the concerns of NEJM, The Lancet and the broader scientific community.
—Sapan Desai, Surgisphere
Researchers also expressed doubts about the African data in interviews with The Scientist and in the open letter to the Lancet, noting that the quality of electronic health records on the continent makes it unlikely that Surgisphere Corporation could have obtained the records of 4,402 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Africa by April 14, when only 15,738 cases had been reported.
Mehra, the medical director of Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, told The Scientist in a statement yesterday that “the results, findings and overall interpretations reported in the study remain unchanged.” However, he adds that the coauthors “have initiated an independent academic review of the data” in the Lancet study.
Desai says in a statement sent via Liz DeForest of the public relations firm Bliss Integrated, that he and his coauthors have today initiated a “voluntary third-party audit of that paper in collaboration with The Lancet.” 
In the meantime, concerns about a second study, also coauthored by Mehra, have come to the fore. An open letter to the NEJM co-organized by James Watson, a senior scientist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand who also organized the open letter to the Lancet, today noted several discrepancies between Surgisphere’s database and national COVID-19 data.
For example, the NEJM study reports data from 346 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Turkey by March 15. However, the letter states, “countrywide, the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed at Istanbul Faculty of Medicine on the 9th of March. The second COVID-19 patient in that hospital was not seen until the 16th of March. The Turkish Ministry of Health reported a total of only 191 PCR positive cases by the 18th of March.”
In response to the NEJM expression of concern—issued just a few hours after the open letter was posted—Desai says he is “arranging a non-disclosure agreement that will provide the authors of the NEJM paper with the data access requested by NEJM. I am confident Surgisphere is able to address the concerns of NEJM, The Lancet and the broader scientific community.”

Clarification (June 4): This story has been updated to include Atlantic Health System among the health systems that did not contribute data to Surgisphere’s database.

First Antibody Trial Launched in COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LIBRE DE DROIT

hanks to a remarkable feat of natural molecular engineering that allows our bodies to generate countless different kinds of antibodies against pathogens, COVID-19 survivors typically have scads of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies cruising through their bloodstreams. Only a few of those antibodies stick to the virus at the right spot, blocking a protein the virus needs to break into cells, while other antibodies bind to it without stopping infection. By the time a human body has generated these diverse antibodies in sufficient quantities, the original infection is usually nearly over, but the antibodies remain, leaving the immune system braced for a second infection.
For the past few months, scientists have been eager to find the most effective antibodies the human body produces and turn them into drugs. In contrast to convalescent plasma therapies—whereby a hodgepodge of antibodies from recovered patients is given to people battling COVID-19—such “monoclonal antibody” treatments would be standardized, manufactured at scale, and potentially more effective. The treatments could be given to people in the early stages of COVID-19, or used prophylactically to give instant, short-term immunity to vulnerable people such as healthcare workers or those in which vaccines may be ineffective. Technological advances have allowed scientists to find promising antibodies at a record pace. Just this week (June 1), the pharma giant Eli Lilly announced the launch of the world’s first human safety trial with a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2.
“Before there’s a vaccine, there could be great use for the antibodies in prevention. And even when there is a vaccine, they could be used in therapy,” says Dennis Burton, chair of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in California. But first, “all of these things need to be tested in humans.”
Choosing the best fighters
Vanderbilt University immunologist James Crowe was already working on a long-term project to develop monoclonal antibodies against potential epidemic-causing viruses in late January when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading into the US. His team rushed to track down people who had recovered from the infection—ones who had been infected in China who then traveled to the US—and procured blood samples. Using several commercial technologies, Crowe and colleagues screened millions of white blood cells to pick out plasma B cells that carry SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies by teasing out the cells with viral antigen.
His team then extracted antibody-encoding DNA from those cells and used that as a blueprint to synthesize them into antibodies. Through experiments testing whether the antibodies could prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering a human cell in vitro, they identified around 400 kinds of antibody that recognized the virus’s spike protein, 50 of which could neutralize the virus in vitro. Several companies Crowe has partnered with—including AstraZeneca, the Nashville-based biotech company IDBiologics, and Ology, a company contracted by the US government to develop and manufacture monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19—are planning clinical trials for some of the candidates in July or August, he says. “[We] literally handed them off to manufacturers within the first few months of an outbreak. That’s what’s different now, is that these technologies have matured to the point where we can compress the time down to weeks—this type of thing used to take years.”
The antibody that Eli Lilly is currently administering to COVID-19 patients, LY-CoV555, was also discovered in some of the first COVID-19 patients in North America, explains Carl Hansen, CEO of the Vancouver-based biotech company AbCellera, which has partnered with Eli Lilly to develop its candidate. “It would normally take anywhere from two and a half years to five years for a program like this to move forward,” Hansen says. But thanks to a rapid antibody identification platform AbCellera scientists have refined as part of the Pandemic Preparedness Program funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency over the past several years, the researchers were able to go from a blood sample to a clinical trial in just three months.
Others are pursuing different strategies. One group of scientists at San Francisco–based Vir Biotechnology turned to antibodies isolated years ago from the blood of people who had recovered from the original SARS coronavirus. They recently found one such antibody that also neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, they reported in Nature. San Francisco–based biotech startup Distributed Bio used computational methods to tweak anti-SARS-CoV antibodies “so they’re adapted to the novel coronavirus,” among other methods, explains the company’s CEO, Jake Glanville, who is working with several academic labs and a Department of Defense laboratory to test his top candidate in hamsters.
The German biotech company Yumab used a library of antibody protein-encoding genes generated from hundreds of healthy people and shuffled the genes in different combinations to create a diverse range of antibodies—essentially mimicking the human body’s own strategy. The team then used a technique known as phage display to screen which antibodies would bind most strongly to SARS-CoV-2 protein. Combined with studies of COVID-19 patients’ blood, the group found several antibodies that looked promising, and are currently testing their efficacy in vitro, explains André Frenzel, the chief scientific officer at Yumab.

Despite being in different stages of development and using different methods to find them, these groups’ antibody candidates are similar: the ones that are most effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 block the receptor binding domain (RBD), a dongle-shape protein at the end of the virus’s spikes that it uses to dock onto the ACE2 receptor of human cells. Eli Lilly’s antibody candidate also binds to the spike protein. “Our prior studies have suggested that blocking receptor binding is a surefire way to neutralize the virus and come up with a protective antibody,” says Erica Ollmann Saphire, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.
Saphire recently launched a consortium of 50 different startups, corporations, and academic labs that have agreed to send their best antibodies to her lab. Her team will then line up the antibodies side by side and identify the very best ones. The goal is to find antibodies that neutralize the virus at the lowest concentrations, which will help reduce the typically sky-high costs for such treatments and make them financially accessible for low- and middle-income countries. “If it’s more potent, you could deliver ten milligrams instead of a hundred milligrams, and so you can reach ten times more people.”
Aiding her team’s investigations is an 11-foot tall cryogenic electron microscope, which can visualize, at the resolution of a couple of angstroms, the precise molecular interactions between antibodies and SARS-CoV-2. Such studies will help scientists identify what exactly makes winning antibodies effective, examining, for instance, the angles from which they approach the viral surface, and which antibodies enhance each other’s efficacy, Saphire says. “You can actually look at what a successful antibody is and how it works.”
Antibodies for prevention or treatment
In Eli Lilly’s Phase 1 trial, 32 COVID-19 patients in the US will receive varying doses of the antibody candidate, LY-CoV555. The study only aims to assess side effects and tolerability, and results are expected by the end of June, according to the press release. This and upcoming trials may also shed light on the possibility of a rare and poorly understood phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement, in which antibodies can worsen viral infections, although there’s no indication this happens with COVID-19 and prior coronavirus exposures or experimental vaccines.

What Do Antibody Tests For SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?
Should the study go well, the company plans to proceed to a Phase 2 trial to test whether the antibody is effective as a treatment, and also to test whether the drug may be promising in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in vulnerable groups. Some groups have tested that concept for SARS-CoV-2 in animal studies, notes Burton, who has experimented with one of his own candidate antibodies in hamsters. Untreated rodents lose around 10–15 percent of their body weight when infected with SARS-CoV-2, “but if we gave them a neutralizing antibody before [infecting them], they were fine—they didn’t lose any weight,” he says. In people, “we would hope that they would stop the virus causing serious disease at least.”
Using three different mouse models, Crowe’s collaborators have also found that some of his antibody candidates “appear to work for prevention or treatments,” he says.
While some companies are focusing on administering individual antibodies, others, such as the New York–based biotech Regeneron, are pursuing cocktail treatments. A single antibody may be easier to manufacture, Hansen notes, but a combination could be important should SARS-CoV-2 mutate in a way that makes one antibody ineffective, although there’s no evidence of that yet, he adds. Eli Lilly aims to test both single and multiple antibody therapies.
Opting for a cocktail strategy would also be wise if it turns out that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using multiple ports of entry into a cell, Saphire says. “Viruses are crafty and many of them have more than one way into the cell.” Researchers can’t yet rule out that possibility for SARS-CoV-2.
The big challenge: making antibodies at scale, affordably
In the past, scientists made antibodies by fusing B cells with a cancer cell line to make them immortal so the cells will produce antibodies indefinitely. But modern, more-efficient methods have replaced that strategy. Some of Crowe’s partners are using tobacco plants that are genetically modified to produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By far the most popular method is to make antibodies using a cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which can be grown in giant bioreactors and the antibodies they produce can be sifted from the culture.
The average annual price of antibody therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases between 1997 and 2016 was nearly $97,000.
However, that manufacturing process is relatively slow—it can take many months to set up a productive CHO cell culture and scale it up in large bioreactors, although several groups are exploring ways to speed up that process, Frenzel notes. The ability to scale up treatments will depend on “just how much will we need and when will we need it,” Hansen says. If the antibodies will only be used for treatment, it’s unlikely there’ll be shortages, but if there’s no vaccine soon, and policymakers decide to give antibody therapies as preventive therapies for large numbers of the public, manufacturing capacity may reach its limits, he says. According to Eli Lilly, the company has begun manufacturing its antibody in bulk and aims to have several hundred thousand doses ready for COVID-19 patients by the end of the year.
In addition, the process of growing these cell cultures, as well as the research to identify and develop the most effective antibodies can make such therapies extremely expensive. The average annual price of antibody therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases between 1997 and 2016 was nearly $97,000, according to a 2018 study. If costs for the first coronavirus antibody treatments push into the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, it raises the question of who will pay for them. Perhaps some governments may be willing to cover, or at least subsidize, the costs of such therapy, favoring it over suffering through the economic disruption of another lockdown, Frenzel speculates.
During a global pandemic, the treatment has to be accessible for developing countries, too. “It is abundantly clear now that infectious disease anywhere in the world can become infectious disease everywhere in the world,” Saphire says. “We are not safe until everyone has access to protection, and so one way or another, we’re going to have to get there.” One problem with antibody therapies developed against Ebola virus is that although they were effective enough to save patients if administered in time, “they were way too expensive to be able to treat a disease which was happening in the developing world,” says Glanville of Distributed Bio.
Eli Lilly did not provide details on the possible cost of such treatments, but Nicole Hebert, a spokesperson for the company, stressed that the priority is finding a treatment for COVID-19, rather than making a profit. “Regarding access, the industry is working with governments and insurers to ensure that when new treatments and vaccines are approved, they will be available and affordable for patients,” Hebert writes to The Scientist in an email.
Glanville says he aims to charge no more than a few hundred dollars a dose—which should suffice as a treatment and provide protection for around two months, he says. “I don’t know the exact number, but I’m not going to be charging eight thousand dollars a dose. I’m going to keep the number deliberately accessible so the whole world can gain access.”
A Brief History of Human Coronaviruses/-/ABOVE: MERS virus particles on the surface of an infected cell
FLICKR.COM, NIAID
O
n January 9 of this year, Chinese state media reported that a team of researchers led by Xu Jianguo had identified the pathogen behind a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan as a novel coronavirus. Although the virus was soon after named 2019-nCoV, and then renamed SARS-CoV-2, it remains commonly known simply as the coronavirus. While that moniker has been catapulted into the stratosphere of public attention, it’s somewhat misleading: Not only is it one of many coronaviruses out there, but you’ve almost certainly been infected with members of the family long before SARS-CoV-2’s emergence in late 2019. 
Coronaviruses take their name from the distinctive spikes with rounded tips that decorate their surface, which reminded virologists of the appearance of the sun’s atmosphere, known as its corona. Various coronaviruses infect numerous species, but the first human coronaviruses weren’t discovered until the mid-1960s. “That was sort of the golden days, if you will, of virology, because at that time the technology became available to grow viruses in the laboratory, and to study viruses in the laboratory,” says University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center pediatrician Jeffrey Kahn, who studies respiratory viruses. But the two coronaviruses that were identified at the time, OC43 and 229E, didn’t elicit much research interest, says Kahn, who wrote a review on coronaviruses a few years after the SARS outbreak of 2003. “I don't believe there was a big effort to make vaccines against these because these were thought to be more of a nuisance than anything else.” 
The viruses cause typical cold symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, and stuffy nose, and they seemed to be very common; one early study estimated that 3 percent of respiratory illnesses in a children’s home in Georgia over seven years in the 1960s had been caused by OC43, and a 1986 study of children and adults in northern Italy found that it was rare to come across a subject who did not have antibodies to that virus (an indicator of past infection).
Coronaviruses’ mild-mannered reputation changed with the SARS outbreak. Although related to OC43 and 229E, SARS-CoV was far deadlier, killing about 10 percent of people it infected—a total of 774 worldwide, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. While it’s still unclear exactly where SARS-CoV came from, similar viruses were later found in bats, and some studies suggested the virus could have jumped to humans via an intermediary such as civets. 
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
While SARS was a wake-up call that coronaviruses posed a greater risk to humans than had been thought, it’s unsurprising that a virus that’s newly spilled over to humans would be more deadly than its human-adapted cousins, says Rachel Roper, a virologist and immunologist at East Carolina University. “When a species is co-evolving with its pathogen . . . they tend to come to a detente, where the virus will be surviving in the population, and the population is surviving without that much illness,” she explains. “But when a virus jumps species, then you’ve got a real problem.”
In the wake of the SARS epidemic, some researchers went looking for other human coronaviruses—and found them. In 2004, researchers in the Netherlands reported they’d found a novel coronavirus, related to 229E, in a child with pneumonia and in four other people with respiratory disease. That virus came to be known as NL63, and Kahn and his colleagues found it at around the same time in hospitalized children in New Haven, Connecticut (Kahn worked at Yale University School of Medicine at the time). 
Although first identified in people with severe infections, NL63 is, much like 229E and OC43, a widespread virus that causes colds in most people it infects. But there were hints that its effects could extend beyond the respiratory tract. In their 2005 paper on the newly-discovered virus, Kahn and his colleagues reported finding it in 8 of 11 patients they tested who had Kawasaki disease, an inflammation of the blood vessels that occurs primarily in young children. But most follow-up studies failed to find such an association. 
“It could be that it was just chance,” Kahn says of his finding, or “there may be a signal there.” His 15-year-old study has acquired new salience in light of reports that COVID-19 is associated with Kawasaki-like symptoms in some children, but he cautions that this inflammatory syndrome has been defined slightly differently by different groups reporting on it, and isn’t identical to Kawasaki disease.
Close on the heels of NL63’s discovery came a report from Hong Kong on yet another common, cold-causing coronavirus, this one called HKU1. As with NL63, researchers in other parts of the world went looking for HKU1, finding it in Australia, France, and the United States, among other places. 
The cold-causing coronaviruses each carry a similar array of symptoms, says Kahn, and it’s not clear how long any of them have been hosted by humans, or where they came from originally. As ubiquitous as they are, other basic questions about these viruses also remain open, such as whether infection with one of them confers lasting immunity. Studies reported in two recent preprints found that it’s not uncommon for a person to be infected with the same coronavirus twice. But Roper suspects that our bodies do learn to fend off coronaviruses they’ve encountered. “There are literally thousands of respiratory viruses, so probably every time you get a cold, you’re getting a new virus that you’ve never seen before,” she says. “Plus, they’re always mutating.”
Until the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, human coronaviruses that have made the news have been both far more deadly and far more contained than their cold-causing counterparts. No cases of SARS have been detected since 2004, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first found in a patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, has caused fewer than 2,500 confirmed cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization—but it kills about 35 percent of people with confirmed diagnoses. SARS-CoV-2, which, as its name suggests, is closely related to SARS-CoV, appears to be far more transmissible, and its mortality rate has so far proven difficult to nail down, but many estimates land at around 1 percent. 
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 may not be containable, Roper says. “I’m a little worried that . . . it’s like closing the barn door after the horses are out.” If that’s the case, she says, the virus’s coexistence with humans will be less analogous to that of other coronaviruses than to illnesses like measles and polio: we’ll be stuck with it indefinitely, but will eventually have vaccines and treatments to mitigate its effects.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Shares Sequence with a Human Protein/-/ABOVE: ISTOCK.COM,
INSTANTS
S
cientists determined earlier this year that there is a cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for furin, a human protease, and that the spike protein is split into two subunits at that spot. This cleavage has been implicated in helping break the virus open so it can enter human cells.
In a paper published May 26 in eLife, researchers found that the spike protein’s furin cleavage site is identical to a sequence in the human epithelial sodium channel, which likewise must be cut by furin in order to be activated. The authors propose that the virus may be competing with the sodium channel for furin, and possibly disrupting its function, but that remains to be demonstrated.
 “The paper’s really nice because it gets at this common view that many viruses co-opt parts of human cells to help them survive,” says David Perlin, who studies infectious diseases and is the chief scientific officer at Hackensack Meridian Health’s Center for Discovery and Innovation in New Jersey. He was not involved in the study.
This discovery came about when researchers at nference, an artificial intelligence company,  started looking to see whether are there any sequences of amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 proteins that seemed surprising or unusual. One that stuck out, says Venky Soundararajan, nference’s chief scientific officer, was a stretch of four amino acids present in the spike protein of 10,956 of 10,967 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the world, but not in the protein’s sequence in related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV or varieties that infect bats or pangolins. Other groups had reported in February and April that this insertion forms a cleavage site for the human protease furin, which is thought to sever the two subunits of the spike protein to facilitate entry into human cells.
Soundararajan and colleagues strengthened this idea when they determined that the furin cleavage site is identical to a proven furin cleavage sequence in the alpha subunit of the human epithelial sodium channel, which plays a role in managing the balance of salt and fluid in many of the body’s cells. This site is essential in the process of assembling the channel’s subunits into a functional whole capable of regulating sodium levels in a cell.
Next, the researchers turned to a platform they developed, which uses a database of single-cell RNA expression data from 65 previously published human and mouse studies, to look into gene expression of the sodium channel and other human genes known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections. They found that expression of the epithelial sodium channel’s gene overlaps with that of the gene for furin and for the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, in the cell types most affected by the virus.
The coupling of ACE2, the epithelial sodium channel, and furin in the epithelial cells of the nasal cavity, the respiratory tract, and the gut supports the idea that those regions are the initial hubs of infection in the human body, Soundararajan says. Perlin warns against making assumptions about ACE2 abundance based on transcript levels. “We have to always be a little careful going from gene expression to what’s assembled on the membrane,” he says.
Based on this RNA co-expression, the authors hypothesize that during a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral spike protein might compete with the human sodium channel for furin cleavage. If this competition disrupts the activation of the sodium channel, it could become dysregulated, which could interfere with its role in regulating fluid balance. This could explain why COVID-19 patients sometimes end up with large amounts of fluid in the lungs.
The study “is all computationally based with no wet experiments. Hence we have zero information on what the authors are suggesting is at all correct,” cautions Vincent Racaniello, a virologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the work, in an email to The Scientist. He also questioned the idea that the cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by human furin could usurp cleavage of the epithelial sodium channel.
It’s also not clear that this sodium channel is downregulated during viral infection. But if furin has a higher affinity for the virus and there is a high viral load in the same region where this sodium channel is expressed, “there is potential there that you’d have less processing of that alpha subunit of the sodium channel and this potentially could also [affect] sodium channel function locally,” says Perlin. “Is that what’s happening? I’m not sure, but it’s an interesting hypothesis.”
“Most computational analysis requires some experimental validation,” says Dario Ghersi, a computational biologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha who did not participate in the study. That this recognition site is present in the majority of SARS-CoV-2 isolates implies that it is important to the virus, meaning the sequence could be of interest for vaccine and therapeutic development. “What they found seems pretty solid to me,” he adds.

OVID-19 has caused disruptions large and small for months now. In late March, the International Olympic Committee postponed the start of the 2020 summer games in Tokyo, which was scheduled for this July. Among the many disturbances sparked by this worldwide disease outbreak, this one is not the gravest by far. But thinking about how I behave while watching the Olympic Games, summer or winter, I can’t help but compare my behaviors to some of the reactions and opinions being shared by the public regarding coronavirus during this uncertain and unnerving time.
I don’t consider myself a huge sports fan (though I can scarcely think of a more enjoyable way to fritter away a Saturday afternoon than lying on my sun-drenched couch nodding off in front of a televised baseball game). But when the Olympics are being broadcast, I transform into an armchair commentator, catching a full-blown case of what I like to call “Olympic fever.” Biathlon, hammer throw, curling, Greco-Roman wrestling . . . whatever happens to catch my attention on any particular day, I submerse myself in the action until I actually start believing that I possess—and must share—some special insight into the sport. Never mind the fact that I know virtually nothing about the intricacies of hurling a giant steel object attached to a ropy tether through the air: “Ooh! He pulled his elbow in too early on that one. That’s going to cost him.” I’ve seen the same behavior in fellow spectators, and sharing this excitement and instant familiarity with a heretofore unfamiliar event is all part and parcel of enjoying the experience, in my opinion.
Unfortunately, I’ve noted a similar phenomenon in people living through the COVID-19 pandemic. And it’s not so benign as feigning expertise in an arcane sport. Almost overnight, people who have had little exposure to epidemiology or virology—much less a formal background in these complex scientific disciplines—have what they present as well-formed and thoroughly researched opinions on the realities of this public health emergency.
ANDRZEJ KRAUZE
At least part of the blame for the recent proliferation of armchair experts is the raw amount of information at our fingertips. In a way, it makes sense that casual observers feel empowered and emboldened to opine on the scientific realities of such an important global event. People are scrambling to learn from myriad outlets everything they can about the virus and its spread. If every bit of news being broadcast were evidence-based and accurate, this smorgasbord of material would cause few problems. But sadly, we know this is not the case. It seems that this global emergency has worsened an already festering problem with information dissemination, mostly via the internet. Now more than ever, misinformation suffuses the stream of stories that we are absorbing. In a recent analysis published in BMJ Global Health, Canadian researchers reported that more than a quarter of the most viewed COVID-19 videos on YouTube contained “misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide.”
To be clear, I’m not suggesting that people should not have opinions about the course of events unfolding in our world or about the actions being taken by organizations, public health officials, or governments. On the contrary, they should. Diverse points of view brought to the table by people experiencing this pandemic within their own set of circumstances will help inform a variety of decisions. But as we battle SARS-CoV-2, science, evidence, and reason are our sharpest weapons. And the most responsible attitude for the nonscientist (and the noneconomist, for that matter) to adopt is one of humility and deference. Being interested in and following along with the scientific details of this pandemic as researchers and other experts learn more about the pathogen and how people are affected by it is one thing. Forming a calcified stance on how and when corrective actions should be taken based on a cursory and hastily assembled understanding of the biology or economics involved in this complex and difficult situation is quite another.
Unfortunately, the new reality of mis- and disinformation is something our global society will live with now and for years to come. We at The Scientist, along with our colleagues in science journalism, will continue to combat this foe by trying to engage people’s attention with accurate and data-driven stories. In the meantime, everyone can work to stem the tide of faulty logic, conspiracy theories, and intentional obfuscation by invoking a phrase that has become all too rare in our information age: “I don’t know.” That may be a hard sentiment to conjure in an era where most answers come literally at the click of a button and when uncertainty can be as terrifying as the microbial threat we face. But now, more than ever, it is crucial that we respect the hard-won experience and knowledge of scientists and public health experts, supporting their efforts and valuing their advice with the trust they deserve.

Disputed Hydroxychloroquine Study Brings Scrutiny to Surgisphere/-/ABOVE: 875 N Michigan Avenue, Chicago—the address on Surgisphere Corporation’s website

S
urgisphere Corporation, the company that supplied data for a controversial study on the health risks of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients published in The Lancet last week (May 22), has found itself in the spotlight after researchers raised questions about the dataset. 
The Lancet study, which lists Surgisphere founder and CEO Sapan Desai as one of four coauthors, reported harmful effects tied to the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine among patients with COVID-19. In response to the findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) and several other health organizations stopped or suspended clinical trials of the drug while they look more closely into the compound’s safety.  
See “WHO Halts Hydroxychloroquine Testing After Safety Concerns”
The database used for the Lancet study, which the paper states includes 96,032 patients from 671 hospitals across six continents, is accessible only by Surgisphere. But in the week since the paper’s publication, concerns about that dataset have swirled on social media, on the post-publication discussion website PubPeer, and in newspapers.  
Initial concerns centered on the paper’s statistical analyses, as well as the fact that COVID-19 patient data were surprisingly homogeneous across continents, despite known differences in demographics and underlying health conditions in those populations. More-recent concerns have broadened to other aspects of the dataset. Desai has since acknowledged one error in an Australian cohort and yesterday published a brief correction. While he has said in an interview with The Scientist that he is looking into clearing up confusion around the study findings, Desai has continued to defend his work and the integrity of the Surgisphere data. 
But that response has not assuaged the concerns of the scientific community. On May 28, an open letter, which has now accrued more than 180 signatories at research institutions around the world, laid out multiple other problems with the study data and analyses. In addition, readers of the study are beginning to ask about the nature and history of Surgisphere, and how it managed to obtain such a complex dataset in a relatively short period of time. 
Sources of Surgisphere’s global COVID-19 data
In explaining the decision to suspend hydroxychloroquine testing, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that although the Lancet data weren’t from a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard in clinical research, they “came from multiple registries and quite a large number of patients, 96,000 patients,” NPR reported earlier this week.  
Concerns about the Lancet paper began appearing on blog posts and PubPeer soon after the study’s publication, however. Statisticians and medical scientists pointed to several peculiarities, including a lack of information about how observational data were adjusted during statistical analyses, and surprisingly high mortality rates in patients who received hydroxychloroquine—a drug that, while unproven as a treatment for COVID-19, has been in use in hospital settings for decades and had not shown such major negative effects in studies up until this point. 
The profile of Surgisphere has risen dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The proportion of COVID-19 patients in Africa who were included in the dataset was also “rather high,” one PubPeer commenter noted: while 15,738 COVID-19 cases had been reported across the continent by the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of April 14, the study claimed to have data—including detailed electronic health records—for 4,402 hospitalized patients up to this same date.  
James Watson, a senior scientist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand, says he has doubts that any research organization would have been able to obtain such detailed records for so many people in Africa so quickly. He outlined this and concerns about multiple other aspects of the study in the open letter, which includes 17 signatories based at institutions in Africa. 
Based on healthcare workers’ descriptions of medical record-keeping at many hospitals in Africa, “I just find it very hard to believe,” Watson tells The Scientist. His unit suspended a just-launched trial of hydroxychloroquine following guidance from UK regulators shortly after the Lancet study was published. 
Desai tells The Scientist that the high-quality hospital data in the publication result from Surgisphere working only with “top-tier institutions. . . . Naturally, this leads to the inclusion of institutions that have a tertiary care level of practice and provide quality health care that is relatively homogeneous around the world.” 
A signatory on the open letter to The Lancet, Anthony Etyang, a consultant physician and clinical epidemiologist with the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kenya, writes to The Scientist that he too has doubts about the numbers of African patients in the dataset, adding that even private hospitals on the continent with top care often have poor medical records. 
Study coauthors Mandeep Mehra, the medical director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, and Frank Ruschitzka of University Hospital Zurich did not respond to requests for comment. 
In another development on May 28, The Guardian reported that researchers and journalists had been unable to verify the source of the Australian data included in the study. Surgisphere’s dataset included 73 deaths in Australia as of April 21, even though Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths since the start of the outbreak, had counted just 67 by that point, the Guardian reported. 
Desai explained the discrepancy to the Guardian by noting that a hospital in Asia had inadvertently been included in the Australian dataset. He has told media outlets that he cannot share the names of any of the hospitals involved in Surgisphere studies due to pre-arranged privacy deals with those hospitals, but adds in an interview with The Scientist that he’ll inquire if any hospitals are willing to voluntarily come forward to confirm their participation.  
On May 29, Jessica Kleyn, a press officer at The Lancet journals, informed The Scientist in an emailed statement that the authors had corrected the Australian data in their paper and redone one of the tables in the supplementary information with raw data rather than the adjusted data Desai said had been shown before.  
“The results and conclusions reported in the study remain unchanged,” Kleyn adds in the email. “The original full-text article will be updated on our website. The Lancet encourages scientific debate and will publish responses to the study, along with a response from the authors, in the journal in due course.” 
Andrew Gelman, a statistician at Columbia University who has blogged about the article and started the PubPeer discussion on it, writes in an email to The Scientist that the authors’ update “does not address many of the questions that have been raised about this study, but of course it is good for them to correct mistakes and omissions when they find them.” 
Watson writes in an email to The Scientist that the authors “have not addressed the other nine points referred to in the letter, and we do not understand why they cannot at least provide data aggregated by country rather than by continent.” He adds that the signatories on the letter would also like to know which countries in Africa the team is working worth.   
“By allowing the authors to post this correction and not address any of the other concerns,” Watson continues, “The Lancet appear to [be] stating that so far they are not worried about the reliability of the study.” 
Surgisphere and its founder
Surgisphere is currently headquartered in Palatine, Illinois, and run by Desai, who trained in vascular surgery, a subject on which he has published many scientific articles and books. Until February 10 of this year, Desai was employed by Northwest Community Hospital (NCH) in suburban Arlington Heights. He tells The Scientist that he resigned for family reasons.  
Court records in Cook County, Illinois, show that Desai is named in three medical malpractice lawsuits filed in the second half of 2019. He tells The Scientist in a statement sent through his public relations representative Michael Roth of Bliss Integrated that while he can’t comment on ongoing litigation, he “deems any lawsuit naming him to be unfounded.”  
He also sent a comment purporting to be from Alan Loren, the executive vice president and chief medical officer of NCH: “Dr. Desai was employed at NCH and resigned in February 2020. We did not have any problems with him while he was here.” 
Asked by The Scientist if he made this statement, Loren says, “What I can tell you is that he was employed here and he did resign. I can’t speak to whether or not there were any problems.” He adds that he spoke to Desai on May 28 and told him that “what I recall is that he resigned. I don’t remember the exact date. And that was it.” 
Desai is now focused on Surgisphere, which currently has 11 employees, he tells The Scientist. Surgisphere’s website states that, “When Dr. Sapan Desai founded Surgisphere Corporation, the mission was simple: to harness the power of data analytics and improve the lives of as many people as possible.” Desai tells The Scientist that his company has always been involved in data analytics.  
When Desai established the company in 2008 while a surgical resident at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, Surgisphere Corporation’s most visible activity was marketing textbooks, produced by Surgisphere, to medical students.  
Sapan Desai says he can understand people’s concerns and that the burden of proof rests with Surgisphere.
Reviews of the company’s products on Amazon are polarized, and a handful of positive reviews that appeared to impersonate actual physicians were removed when those doctors complained to Amazon. Kimberli S. Cox, a breast surgical oncologist based in Arizona, tells The Scientist that she was one of several practicing physicians who in 2008 discovered five-star reviews next to names that were identical or very similar to their own, that they had not written. She and her colleagues successfully persuaded Amazon to take the reviews down.  
Desai denies that he knew about or was in any way involved in the posting of fake reviews for Surgisphere’s products. “If I wanted to review my own products, I could do it in my own name,” he says. Amazon did not return requests for comment before this story was published. 
When Desai moved to the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in 2012 as a fellow in vascular surgery, he registered Surgisphere Corporation in Texas. By that point, Surgisphere had started publishing the Journal of Surgical Radiology, a medical journal that, according to its website, “accrued over 50,000 subscribers spanning almost every country around the world” from 2010 to 2013.  
The website further notes that, “With almost one million page views per month, J Surg Rad earned a reputation as one of the first high quality peer-reviewed online medical journals. The Journal was indexed by most of the major medical indexes, and specific articles still appear in PubMed, EBSCO, and other sources.”  
“It was amazing how fast we were able to grow it,” Desai tells The Scientist. “We had quite the editorial board.” The last issue was published in January 2013. “Running a medical journal is a full-time job,” he says. “I ran out of time.”
Surgisphere’s research during the coronavirus pandemic
The profile of Surgisphere has risen dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the recent Lancet study, Surgisphere provided data for a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month. That study, which stated it was based on data from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, reported that cardiovascular disease was associated with increased risk of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.  
However, heart drugs known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which some other studies had hinted were associated with an increased risk of death in people hospitalized with COVID-19, were not associated with higher mortality in these patients, the study concluded. 
Currently, Surgisphere is providing data for another COVID-19 study with Lee Wallis, the head of emergency medicine for the Western Cape Government, the University of Cape Town, and Stellenbosch University. Like the study coauthors on the Lancet paper, Wallis and his collaborators helped design the study, but all of the raw data are kept by Surgisphere as proprietary information. 
Wallis tells The Scientist that he has seen aggregated rather than hospital-level data, but that he is satisfied by Desai’s detailed descriptions of the dataset, and that all the necessary ethical and data-ownership requirements have been met.
The company has publicized other projects, too. In early March, a story appeared on a medical device information site touting a COVID-19 diagnostic tool developed by Surgisphere that could identify patients “likely to have coronavirus infection” with “93.7% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity.” The story, which Desai says Surgisphere did not write, quotes Desai as saying: “This tool is the first effective weapon in the fight against this global pandemic.” 
Desai says that the story he’s quoted in “appears to misconstrue the resources we created,” directing The Scientist to descriptions of a “COVID Severity Scoring Tool” and a “COVID-19 Triage Decision Support Tool” on the company’s website. The Scientist could not obtain more information about exactly how the tools worked or how estimates of their specificity and sensitivity were calculated. 
As for The Lancet hydroxychloroquine study, Desai says he can understand people’s concerns and that the burden of proof rests with Surgisphere. “We want to prove this to the world,” he tells The Scientist. “One thing that we might be able to do is get what we’ve done audited. That will be external, third party, independent of who we are, and can help validate all of this.”

Researchers Applaud Spanish COVID-19 Serological Survey/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ILZE KALVE
E
arlier this month, Spain published the results of a country-wide seroprevalence survey, which tested 60,000 residents for antibodies that suggest they had already been infected with—and thus may be safe from a future infection by—SARS Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The survey estimated that about 5 percent of the country’s population had been exposed to the virus, varying from 1.1 percent to 14.2 percent between regions of the country. Unfortunately, this means almost all of the population is still at risk.
“We have not been surprised” by the results, Salvador Illa, health minister, said at a news briefing earlier this month, according to Reuters. “There is no herd immunity in Spain.”
Seroprevalence surveys for anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have faced considerable criticism from scientists, in part because the tests themselves have varied widely in the accuracy of their results. For instance, a widely publicized seroprevalence study on residents of Santa Clara County, California, generated concerns about the false positive rate of its antibody test and the ways it recruited participants. This led many critics to suggest the results—which initially suggested an infection rate of 2.5–4.2 percent among the county’s residents and were later adjusted to 1.3–4.7 percent—were likely misleading, and one statistician to suggest that the study authors “owe us all an apology.”
See “How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2”
The Spanish study, on the other hand, earned the praise of epidemiologists and virologists who say that both the test and the design of the survey were successful. Chris Sempos, a nutritional epidemiologist who works with the National Institutes of Health and recently published a preprint showing how data from serology tests can be analyzed to produce the most accurate estimates, says, “Everyone’s trying to do a good job, and they don’t have much time right now. . . . Overall, I was very impressed with the Spanish survey.” He adds that, based on the accuracy of the tests, it’s possible that the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Spain is around 6 percent instead of 5 percent, but he “wouldn’t say that’s qualitatively different.”
False starts
This is not the first time Spain has attempted to make use of an antibody test to reveal the extent of the spread of SARS-Cov-2 through its population. At the end of March, the government returned tests it had purchased from a company called BioEasy that scientists found were only able to detect 30 percent of cases—70 percent of positive controls were categorized as negative. BioEasy sent replacement tests, but the country also deemed them to be inaccurate, and sent back the entire order of 640,000 tests near the end of April. It’s not clear how much money the government spent on the tests, but according to the newspaper El Pais, “the process has begun to recover the money that was paid for the kits.”
As companies raced to provide tests, regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, have relied on manufacturers to measure the validity of their own products. After the early mishaps in Spain and concerns about tests being used in other European countries, China cracked down and has approved a limited number of tests for export to other countries. The US also moved to require emergency use authorizations for antibody tests.
The test used in Spain’s latest survey, manufactured by Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, did not appear to be approved for export from China, according to NBC News, however, it has received a CE mark in Europe, indicating the product’s safety.
Caryn Bern, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is working on the COVID-19 Testing Project to evaluate a variety of COVID19 antibody tests, says that she “wouldn’t be surprised if it’s just bureaucratic red tape,” or a backlog of approvals in China, that explains the lack of export approval. “This seems to be a good test, if you ask me.”
Accuracy of the test
The company manufacturing the test reached out to a research group in Sweden to verify its accuracy. A small study by researchers at Uppsala University found that the test’s sensitivity for IgG—an antibody that tends to show up a week or more after infection—was 93.1 percent and its specificity, or how accurately it could confirm a lack of IgG antibodies for SARS-Cov-2, was 99.2 percent. While the test can also recognize another antibody, IgM, the Spanish survey focused on IgG.
“We were then lucky to be asked to evaluate the rapid test Zhejiang Orient Gene/Healgen, and even more lucky that this test performed so well as shown by our published results.” Åke Lundkvist, a virologist at Uppsala University and the senior author of the study, tells The Scientist in an email. “The Dutch Public Health Agency in Amsterdam and the Erasmus University in Rotterdam have later made an evaluation of a number of Rapid tests and some ELISAs, and they confirmed the very good performance of the Zhejiang Orient Gene/Healgen Rapid test.”
After measuring the test’s validity themselves, The Carlos III Institute of Health and the National Statistics Institute in Spain recruited 60,897 volunteers willing to take the rapid test, which requires a quick finger prick, and answer a series of questions about whether they’d had symptoms or exposure to others with COVID-19. To assess the accuracy of the survey, the team collected additional venous blood samples from the arms of nearly 90 percent of the participants to be analyzed in the laboratory using a more precise automated assay. At the time of the report, the center had analyzed  16,953 of the blood samples and found that 97.3 percent of these results matched the results from the rapid test.
“I'm extremely impressed by how robust the epidemiology and coordination are for the Spanish National Sero survey,” says Bern. “I think that the way they went about sampling and validating the rapid test were exactly what I would have recommended.”
Neutrophil Extracellular Traps May Augur Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: An immunofluorescence microscopy image of neutrophils (DNA labeled in blue) expelling NETs (neutrophil elastase stained green) in the presence of serum from a COVID-19 patient

I
n March this year, two University of Michigan physicians spotted a striking similarity between an autoimmune disease they had been studying and COVID-19. Both conditions appeared to involve blood clots in arteries, veins, and the microvasculature, rheumatologist Jason Knight and cardiologist and vascular medicine specialist Yogen Kanthi observed. Because a release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), webs of chromatin and proteins flung from immune cells, underlies the excessive clotting seen in the autoimmune disease, known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), they decided to study whether NETs could be relevant to COVID-19 as well.
The research team used serum samples collected at admission from 50 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a PCR test, and measured their levels of NET biomarkers—specifically, cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA, and citrullinated histone 3.
The results, published April 24 in JCI Insight, show increased levels of these biomarkers in sera of COVID-19 patients with severe disease compared to healthy controls. Kanthi tells The Scientist that the amount of NET biomarkers at admission was predictive of which patients progressed to respiratory failure. The team also found that sera from COVID-19 patients triggered NET formation from control neutrophils in vitro. 
Sampling these biomarkers could aid decision-making regarding the allocation of precious resources, such as ventilators, he says.
Paul Kubes, an immunologist at the University of Calgary who works on NETs and is currently studying their function in COVID-19, says that the study was largely correlative, but “they provided pretty good evidence that there are NETs” in COVID-19. Now researchers want to determine whether NETs can be used not only to predict disease symptoms, but stop them as well.
Neutrophils in COVID-19

NETs are extracellular DNA fibers studded with histones and antimicrobial proteins and enzymes, such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase, which form a meshwork that ensnares and kills pathogens. NETs were first described in bacterial infections by Volker Brinkmann and Arturo Zychlinsky at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany in 2004. The role of neutrophils and NETs in viral infections was recognized by Kubes and others in 2012.
See “Why Immune Cells Extrude Webs of DNA and Protein”
For Harvard Medical School’s Denisa Wagner, who has been working on NETs for the past 12 years and studying their role in COVID-19 since February, the presence of NETs in COVID-19 was a foregone conclusion. She tells The Scientist that almost every virus induces NETosis, as the process of NET formation is called.
NETs are released by neutrophils, which often die during the process. Along with macrophages, neutrophils are the prime phagocytic cells or scavengers of the body, and are part of the innate immune system—the first line of defense against pathogens.
Although NETs evolved as part of the innate immune response by the host, they can cause significant collateral damage, such as inflammation and blood clots. “I would not be surprised if it turned out that NETs have clinical relevance in severe COVID-19,” says Brinkmann. 
In a perspective piece published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in April, Betsy Barnes, an immunologist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Mikala Egeblad, a breast cancer researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and others report extensive neutrophil infiltration and inflammation in the capillaries of the lungs as well as neutrophils in the alveoli, or air spaces, of the lungs in autopsy specimens from three patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Knight, who is also a coauthor of the report, tells The Scientist in an email, “It looks like NETs can be found at the scene of crime. Of course, further mechanistic studies will be needed to prove causality”—that is, whether NETs are indeed behind the damage. 
See “Could Curbing Runaway Immune Responses Treat COVID-19?”
The authors of this report and the study in JCI Insight are part of a consortium called the NETwork to Target Neutrophils in COVID-19, which has about 25 members located in five countries. The NETwork was started by Egeblad with the goal to rapidly determine whether neutrophils and NETs play a role in COVID-19.
“We really need more data to know what is going on there,” says Barnes, who studies NETs in the context of autoimmune disease.
Egeblad, who has been working on the role of NETs in cancer metastasis, says that the next step would be to establish causality. “This will probably not be known for several months as causality can only be shown either directly through COVID-19 experimental model systems that are only just emerging or indirectly by targeting NETs with drugs in clinical trials,” she adds.
Targeting NETs in COVID-19 clinical trials
DNase—the enzyme that degrades DNA—is the only FDA-approved NET inhibitor; this seems to be well tolerated by cystic fibrosis patients, some of whom have NETs in their mucus. “If the mucus in the lungs of COVID-19 patients contains NETs, this treatment should fluidify the mucus and allow better gas exchange,” says Brinkmann.
A recent paper proposes the use of DNase against runaway levels of NETs in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brinkmann explains that DNA-containing chromatin is the backbone of NETs. Attached to this backbone are protein complexes that contain cytoplasmic enzymes and peptides. “If you destroy the DNA, NETs fall apart like a torn pearl necklace.” 
Currently, two clinical trials in the UK and France are testing DNase in COVID-19 patients. Barnes is leading a retrospective study in collaboration with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on COVID-19 patients who were treated with DNase while on mechanical ventilation. In Canada, Kubes is exploring the possibility of running a clinical trial with DNase on COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.
NETs can also be targeted by experimental drugs that block their formation. Kubes says that neutrophil elastase inhibitors, which block an enzyme required for NETosis, would be very effective “because you prevent NET release rather than just destroying NETs that have already been made.” Wagner is also in talks with an Indian company that is testing peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitors, which interfere with another enzyme that is essential during NET formation.

The link between NETs and thrombosis
Blood clots are a frequent complication of COVID-19, and scientists are beginning to suspect that NETs might be the culprit.
Wagner’s team first showed in 2010 that NETs are linked to thrombosis. “NETs are terribly thrombogenic,” she says. So, whenever there is neutrophilia, an excess of neutrophils in the blood circulation, there is an associated predisposition to thrombosis. Neutrophilia has been a constant theme across all cohorts of COVID-19 patients, and complications related to clotting, ranging from pulmonary embolism to swollen, painful, discolored toes, are increasingly being reported.
Adrian Newland, a hematologist at Barts and The London NHS Trust, tells The Scientist in an email that globally among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, there is a 33 percent incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition where blood clots clog the veins and may break off and lodge in the lungs. “This reflects a disordered clotting system as a reaction to the infection, and is well described, although we learn more about the condition on an almost daily basis,” he says.
In a preprint posted on May 5, Kanthi and Knight demonstrated significantly elevated NET remnants in the sera of three COVID-19 patients presenting with VTE. The authors say that given the strong association between NETs and thrombosis in other diseases, the potential link between NETs and VTE in COVID-19 warrants exploration.
Intrinsic to VTE are platelets, the chief blood cells that stop bleeding, and they may be critical in this emerging connection between blood clots, NETs, and COVID-19. “Platelets activate neutrophils, which form NETs,” Wagner explains, “but NETs bind platelets and activate them, so it snowballs.”
Targeting platelets could indirectly lead to reduced NET formation. In fact, the Michigan group led by Kanthi is currently planning a clinical trial to test whether the anti-platelet drug dipyridamole could be used to treat COVID-19 patients. They recently showed that the drug protects against NETosis and thrombosis in APS.
“Whether anti-platelet agents have a part to play here is up for discussion,” says Newland. He adds that there is also the counterargument that if used in patients with low platelets (mildly reduced platelet counts are consistently seen in COVID-19), they may lead to more bleeding events.

First US Outbreak of COVID-19 Seeded in Mid-February: Preprint/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 400TMAX
A
n outbreak of coronavirus infections in Washington State that began at the end of February was likely sparked by a traveler who entered the state in mid-February, rather than by an infected person who flew from Wuhan, China, to Seattle in mid-January, as was previously thought. That’s the conclusion of a preprint posted on bioRxiv May 23 that modeled various transmission scenarios based on the genomes of viral samples collected from patients in Washington State and elsewhere.
The study confirms “a lot of what we were starting to suspect from the epidemiological data, that there were some early introductions in the West Coast that did not spark sustained transmission,” Northeastern University’s Samuel Scarpino, who was not involved in the work, tells STAT.
Initial studies by Trevor Bedford, who studies pathogen evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, indicated that the viral genomes from the first case identified in Washington State in January, known as WA1, and a patient diagnosed in late February in the same state were similar enough to suggest there had been “cryptic transmission” for weeks before the outbreak was recognized. 
Armed with much more genomic information amassed in the ensuing months, Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona and his colleagues simulated 1,000 different viral evolution scenarios to see if any would connect WA1 to the Washington infections six weeks later. Yet the models didn’t spit out the later infections’ viral sequences. “[W]e failed to observe a single simulated epidemic that has the characteristics of the real phylogeny,” the authors write in their report. 
“In all likelihood this didn’t start with WA1,” Worobey tells STAT. “It started with some unidentified person who arrived in Washington state at some later point. And we don’t know from where.” Bedford agrees with the conclusions of Worobey’s team, he tweeted on May 25.
See “Countries Begin Large-Scale Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage”
The new study also examined the likely origins of Europe’s first outbreaks, concluding that a cluster of cases in Germany did not seed the pandemic in Italy. Instead, the data point to both countries’ outbreaks starting independently by travelers coming from China, and then transmission of the virus from Italy to New York in late February.
Worobey and his authors note that because undetected cases in Washington were unlikely between mid-January and mid-February, the US missed opportunities for testing and contact tracing to prevent an outbreak.
“Our finding that the virus associated with the first known transmission network in the US did not enter the country until mid-February is sobering,” the authors write, “since it demonstrates that the window of opportunity to block sustained transmission of the virus stretched all the way until that point.”
WHO Halts Hydroxychloroquine Testing Over Safety Concerns/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 
ADAM SOOS
Update (June 18): The World Health Organization announced yesterday that it was dropping hydroxychloroquine from the Solidarity trial after new data suggest the drug is ineffective as a COVID-19 treatment or prophylaxis. A study published June 3 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the drug did not prevent people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from becoming sick, while findings released in a press statement from the UK RECOVERY trial on June 5 indicate that the drug does not improve survival or reduce hospital stay duration in COVID-19 patients.
Update (June 3): The World Health Organization today announced that it would be resuming hydroxychloroquine testing in its Solidarity Trial, following widespread criticism of The Lancet paper and the dataset it was based on.  
T
he World Health Organization has suspended testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine after a study published in The Lancet reported that COVID-19 patients taking the drug were dying at higher rates than other patients with the disease.
The study, which drew from a registry of more than 96,000 patients from 671 hospitals across six continents, concluded that patients given chloroquine, its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine, or either of the drugs in combination with antibiotics all had a significantly higher risk of death than patients not taking the drugs. They also had an elevated risk of heart rhythm complications, the study reported. The findings were published last week (May 22).
“To our knowledge, these findings provide the most comprehensive evidence of the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine . . . for treatment of COVID-19,” the study authors write in their paper. “Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens” in hospitalized patients.
See “Chloroquine for COVID-19: Cutting Through the Hype”
In response to the findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suspended testing of hydroxychloroquine in its so-called Solidarity Trial, a project set up to test the efficacy of this and three other drugs as treatments for COVID-19. 
“The steering committee met over the weekend, in the light of this uncertainty,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan tells NPR. “We decided we should be proactive, err on the side of caution and suspend enrollment temporarily into the hydroxychloroquine arm” of the trial. The study organizers will review data that have already been collected and meet in the next couple of weeks to decide whether to resume testing with hydroxychloroquine. 
Other health organizations have issued their own responses to the findings. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority, for example, has halted a trial of hydroxychloroquine in older people with COVID-19 and another preventive study, although a separate UK trial of the drug in COVID-19 patients is continuing, the Daily Mail reports.
See “Journal Publisher Concerns over Hydroxychloroquine Study”
Over the weekend, some statisticians and health scientists called the study data into question, noting, among other things, apparent uniformity of the patient populations across continents. For example, a table of summary data shows smoking rates that are between 9.4 percent and 10.3 percent for all six continents—a small range compared to the range of smoking rates in the general population of each of those continents.
Contacted by The Scientist, the study authors write that their results are in line with other studies that have found no benefit for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatments for COVID-19, and call for randomized controlled trials to follow up the work.  
The authors further note that concerns about data uniformity stem from confusion about what the summary data table shows. The table contains “propensity score matched and weighted data,” not raw data, study coauthor Sapan Desai of Illinois-headquartered data analytics firm Surgisphere Corporation writes in an email to The Scientist. While the data are accurate, he adds, the team is working with The Lancet to provide an additional, raw-data version of the table in order to clear up the confusion.
In late April, the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned people against taking the drug outside of a hospital setting, highlighting hydroxychloroquine’s known association with serious heart problems. The European Medicines Agency made a similar warning, noting that neither hydroxychloroquine nor chloroquine had been shown to be effective at treating COVID-19.
US President Donald Trump told reporters earlier this month that he was taking a two-week course of the drug as a preventive measure—an announcement that was widely criticized by health professionals. Several governments, including the UK’s and multiple US states’, have been stockpiling hydroxychloroquine and planning their own trials with COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 Vaccine Researchers Mindful of Immune Enhancement/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PETERSCHREIBER.MEDIA
M
ost people who contract the dengue virus, a mosquito-borne RNA virus, experience mild symptoms or none at all. In some cases, it can cause a severe illness known as hemorrhagic fever, with bleeding, abnormal blood clotting, and leaky blood vessels that can sometimes lead to a precipitous drop in blood pressure and circulatory collapse. Curiously, in the 1960s, US army scientists in Thailand noticed this life-threatening condition occurred most frequently in two populations: first-time infected babies born to mothers who were immune to dengue, and children who had once experienced a mild or asymptomatic infection, and later contracted the virus a second time. A scary scenario began to crystalize: a second infection was sometimes worse than the first.
A series of studies in cells, animals, and people eventually gave rise to a possible explanation: antibodies created during a first-time infection could, under very specific circumstances, end up enhancing the disease rather than protecting against subsequent infections. Researchers called this “antibody-dependent enhancement,” or ADE.
To date, I haven’t seen any clear evidence to support ADE or ERD, but it’s something you want to be aware of for sure.
—Dennis Burton, the Scripps Research Institute
ADE is one form of immune enhancement, a poorly understood group of phenomena occurring when components of our immune system that usually protect against viral infections somehow end up backfiring. It’s a concern in situations when people are continuously re-infected with particular pathogens, and with vaccines that work by injecting snippets of virus to mimic a first infection. Some immunizations, such as those against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have been observed in the past to make disease worse when vaccinated individuals contract the virus.
As far as researchers know, such cases are exceedingly rare across viruses. For SARS-CoV-2, it’s unclear if any forms of immune enhancement could play a role in infections or vaccines under development, but there is no evidence so far.
“[It’s just] a theoretical risk, but people are being extremely careful to make sure that this risk is not becoming a reality,” notes Paul-Henri Lambert, an immunologist and vaccinologist retired from the University of Geneva who now advises the university’s center of vaccinology and consults for a multinational collaborative project of researchers on safety evaluations of vaccine candidates. “With COVID-19, we have a disease which in eighty percent of people is selectively mild. So what you would not like is to give a vaccine that would not protect well and in a certain percentage of people make the disease worse.”
No evidence yet for antibody-dependent enhancement in COVID-19
Dengue remains the best-studied and one of the very few solid examples of ADE. It’s thought to occur in communities where there are multiple viral strains of dengue circulating. While antibodies against one dengue strain will typically reliably protect against that strain, things can go awry when the antibodies encounter a different strain of dengue. Instead of neutralizing the virus—that is, binding to and blocking a protein the pathogen needs to enter host cells—the antibodies only bind to the virus without neutralizing it.
That can become a problem when immune cells, such as macrophages, dock onto the tail ends of antibodies using specialized receptors known as Fc receptors—which they often do to clear up antibody-virus debris. Because dengue viruses can use Fc receptors to infect cells, if the antibodies aren’t disabling the pathogen, they actually end up helping the virus enter macrophages to infect the cells, Trojan horse–style, explains Dennis Burton, a microbiologist at the Scripps Research Institute in California. This amplifies viral replication, potentially pushing the immune system into over-drive and paving the way for severe disease. “That’s the hallmark of ADE, basically . . . you make infection easier, you infect more cells, you get worse disease.”
But there are still many questions surrounding ADE and its mechanism. It’s not entirely clear, for instance, if the antibodies are the sole effectors of ADE, or if other parts of the immune system also play a role. Nor is it certain whether it’s strictly the non-neutralizing characteristic of the antibodies that matters most—it could also be that neutralizing antibodies could also allow viruses to infect macrophages if they’re not numerous enough to block all key proteins across a virus’s surface.
“It might be that any antibody would enhance if you’ve got it at a dose that doesn’t work,” notes James Crowe, an immunologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “This is very hard to study in humans.”
Solid evidence for ADE in natural viral infections exists only in dengue virus and some of its relatives. There are a handful of other viruses where ADE has been demonstrated in vitro—in experiments that mix macrophages or similar cells with antibodies and virus and see whether the virus is capable of infecting the cells in spite of the presence of antibodies, Crowe explains. Such experiments have found hints of ADE with viruses including Ebola virus, HIV, and coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. However, it’s still a mystery to what extent this occurs in live organisms in the presence of a functioning immune system. “The immune system typically modulates things to your benefit. I’m not saying that ADE does not occur in the body—I’m just saying it’s difficult to bridge the results in the test tube to what happens in the body,” Crowe says.
It’s not yet clear if SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting macrophages. Although some scientists have reportedly spotted viral protein inside macrophages, whether it actually infects and replicates in macrophages in the body “is something investigators are trying to determine right now,” Crowe says.
Barney Graham, the deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’s Vaccine Research Center, which is collaborating with the company Moderna on a coronavirus vaccine, told PNAS last month that he doubts the dengue mechanism of ADE would apply to SARS-CoV-2 because the coronavirus primarily targets ACE2, not Fc, receptors, and has a very different pathogenesis compared to the dengue family. And even for the original SARS that caused an outbreak in 2003, in vitro experiments suggest that it could infect a human cell line using an Fc receptor, but the virus did not reproduce into infectious particles, Graham writes in a perspective article in Science.
It’s theoretically possible that infections caused by other coronaviruses could generate antibodies in people’s blood and cause ADE upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, but there’s little evidence for this so far, Crowe notes. And in principle, some COVID-19 patients could develop antibodies that don’t neutralize, or produce neutralizing ones at insufficient concentrations, and then develop severe symptoms once they’re infected a second time. But a handful of reported SARS-CoV-2 re-infections have been found to be due to flawed tests. And two preprints appeared last week suggesting that in US patients who received antibody-containing blood plasma transfusions from COVID-19 survivors, the treatment did not make the disease worse, supporting the argument against ADE.
ADE’s role in vaccine development
Nevertheless, ADE is a possibility that vaccine scientists are keeping a watchful eye on, in part due to experiences with other vaccines. When researchers in the 1990s tested vaccines against feline infectious peritonitis, a rare and typically fatal coronavirus disease in cats, vaccinated kittens died much sooner than unvaccinated ones after being exposed to the virus.
Such concerns have pushed some scientists to reconsider vaccine design. One explanation for why some of the early cat coronavirus vaccines caused ADE weren’t using the right vaccine targets, or the targets weren’t specific enough. This could have produced antibodies that target parts of the virus without blocking the specific site on its spike protein which it uses to infect cells—the receptor-binding domain (RBD).
Solid evidence for ADE in natural viral infections exists only in dengue virus and some of its relatives.
This is one reason why some investigators, including microbiologist and vaccinologist Maria Bottazzi of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, specifically pursue the RBD as a vaccine target--to avoid the possibility of generating non-neutralizing antibodies. “If you’re just giving the immune system the only choice of making an antibody to the receptor binding domain, then you drastically limit the possibility of inducing ADE,” explains her colleague, immunologist David Corry.
Burton says vaccine tests in animal models will help researchers understand the likelihood of ADE occurring in a COVID-19 vaccine, although that won’t be conclusive proof until clinical tests in humans are conducted. Encouragingly, some recent preliminary vaccine studies found no evidence of ADE. In an April preprint, a team of researchers from the US and China showed that injecting rats with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein triggered a burst of neutralizing antibodies, which did not cause ADE when mixed with virus and Fc-expressing cells in vitro. In addition, even a whole inactivated virus vaccine recently tested by Chinese researchers in four macaques protected against exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the researchers found no evidence of ADE.
As long as it’s a good vaccine with a specific target that induces a strong neutralizing antibody response, it’s unlikely we’ll see ADE, “certainly not commonly,” Crowe says. “It’s only when you have an ineffective vaccine or antibody that you might see [ADE]. And no one wants to move those [candidates] forward anyway, so that’s why I’m optimistic.”
Other mechanisms of immune enhancement in vaccines
Bottazzi says she thinks processes involving other components of the immune system may be more relevant for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine concerns than ADE. Different routes to immune enhancement came to the foreground in the 1960s during clinical trials where young children were immunized with whole-inactivated virus vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). When the children contracted RSV naturally a few months after the vaccinations, those who were immunized got a lot sicker than those who weren’t. In fact, in one trial, 80 percent of children in the youngest cohort had to be hospitalized, and two died.
The syndrome those hospitalized kids developed is called vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), and is linked with two immunological phenomena, Graham explains in the Science article. The first is a high concentration of binding antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus and result in the formation of antibody-virus complexes that get stuck in the small airways of the lungs, obstructing these spaces and driving inflammation—a mechanism considered different from ADE, Burton explains.
Researchers also unexpectedly found large numbers of certain white blood cells in the lungs of the children who died, including a proinflammatory kind of cell called an eosinophil, usually associated with allergic reactions. This raised concerns that the vaccine could have somehow primed the immune system to trigger an inappropriate cellular immune response. Normally, vaccines or viral infections trigger a particular group of T helper (Th) cells—known as Th1 cells—to mediate a cascade of reactions involving various infection-fighting immune cells.
But in several studies in animals that received a similar RSV vaccine, challenge with the RSV virus seemed to trigger certain cytokines that mobilized a very different subpopulation of T helper cells, known as Th2 cells. The lungs of inoculated mice were also packed with inflammatory cells, eosinophils in particular. Researchers hypothesized that the vaccine was inducing a response by Th2 cells, which then attracted eosinophils and somehow induced “a kind of allergic reaction,” Lambert explains.
A similar phenomenon was seen in animals that received coronavirus vaccines in the past—making researchers such as Bottazzi wary of such forms of immune enhancement. For instance, when researchers administered an inactivated SARS vaccine into mice, and then challenged them with the live virus, they also found eosinophils and other blood cells in the animals’ lungs and livers—a possible sign of Th2-type immune responses. Despite these signs of immune enhancement, that SARS vaccine did a good job in producing neutralizing responses, and vaccinated animals survived.
Bottazzi cautions against extrapolating from animal studies to humans. It’s possible cellular immune enhancement is an artifact of the animal models or the experimental system.
Of nearly 140 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, 15 are already in human trials. “To date, I haven’t seen any clear evidence to support ADE or ERD, but it’s something you want to be aware of for sure,” Burton says. “It may be that the vaccines that are already out there—Moderna, Janssen, and so on—they may turn out to be perfectly great, we just don’t know at this point. I think it’s good to have a plan B, where if there are some problems, you can start working it out quickly what they are, and re-engineering your vaccines based on knowledge about what’s wrong.”
Alzheimer’s Gene Linked to Higher Risk of Severe COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TRAFFIC_ANALYZER
T
he APOE ε4 gene variant that puts people at a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease also has a link to COVID-19. According to a study published today (May 26) in The Journals of Gerontology, Series A, carrying two copies of the variant, often called APOE4, makes people twice as likely to develop a severe form of the disease, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus currently spreading around the world.
David Melzer of Exeter University and colleagues used genetic and health data on volunteers in the UK Biobank to look at the role of the APOE4 variant, which affects cholesterol transport and inflammation. Of some 383,000 people of European descent included in the study, more than 9,000 carried two copies. The researchers cross-referenced this list with people who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 16 and April 26—the assumption being that most such cases were severe because testing at the time was largely limited to hospital settings. The analysis suggested that the APOE4 homozygous genotype was linked to a doubled risk of severe disease, compared with people who had two copies of another variant called ε3.
The result isn’t due to nursing home settings or to a greater likelihood of having a diagnosis of dementia, which none of the 37 people with two copies of APOE4 who tested positive for COVID-19 had. “It is pretty bulletproof—whatever associated disease we remove, the association is still there,” Melzer tells The Guardian. “So it looks as if it is the gene variant that is doing it.”
It is still possible that dementia itself is playing a roll, says David Curtis, an honorary professor at the University College London Genetics Institute, to The Guardian. Some of those 37 people who tested positive have or will develop cognitive issues, but just don’t have a diagnosis currently. “I’m afraid this study does not really convince me that the ApoE e4 allele [gene variant] is really an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 infection. I would want to see this tested in a sample where dementia could be more confidently excluded, perhaps a younger cohort. I am sure additional data will soon emerge to illuminate this issue.”
If APOE4 is influencing the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, it wouldn’t be the first gene to be fingered as an important factor. Variants in the ACE2 gene that encodes the protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to on host cells, in the HLA genes, and in the genes encoding the ABO blood types have also been linked to COVID-19 susceptibility or severity in preliminary studies.
See “DNA Could Hold Clues to Varying Severity of COVID-19”
Tara Spires-Jones, neurodegeneration researcher at the University of Edinburgh who did not participate in the study, tells the publication, “It is possible that the role of ApoE in the immune system is important in the disease and future research may be able to harness this to develop effective treatments.”
SARS-CoV-2 Protein Hampers Innate Immune Reaction In Vitro/-/ABOVE: An artist’s rendering of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

T
he coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, induces a puny innate immune response compared other respiratory viruses such as the flu. In a preprint posted on bioRxiv on May 12, researchers have shown in cell culture that a viral protein called open reading frame 3b (ORF3b) actively blocks the induction of type I interferon, a crucial aspect of that response.
This protein “is clearly a very good blocker of these early innate defenses of the cells, and it relates perfectly to what we see in organoids and animal models and in COVID-19 patients,” says Benjamin tenOever, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “The virus—for reasons like ORF3b—is very good at shutting off and minimizing the amount of this key antiviral defense called interferon, which plays a really important role in slowing virus infection and inhibiting further replication while you wait for your T cells and your B cells to come in.”
tenOever was not involved in the current study, but in a paper that’s now been published in Cell, which The Scientist reported on as a preprint, his group described how underwhelming the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is. “It’s a bioRxiv paper, so you always have to be a little bit careful that it hasn’t been heavily scrutinized by unbiased reviewers, but, that said, it also makes a lot of sense,” he adds.
See “Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV”
Based on clinical reports of COVID-19 and SARS patients, it was apparent to Kei Sato, a virologist at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, and colleagues that the virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 differ from those of SARS-CoV, the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak in more than 8,000 people in 2003. “We just hypothesized that the functions of some viral genes are different between them,” Sato writes in an email to The Scientist.
It was unbelievable that a 22–amino acid protein suppresses type I interferon.
—Kei Sato, University of Tokyo
To test this idea, the researchers compared the lengths of viral genes between the two coronaviruses. They noticed the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is considerably shorter than its SARS-CoV ortholog, encoding a protein just 22 amino acids long, compared to the 154 amino acids of SARS-CoV ORF3b, thanks to the presence of premature stop codons. The team also found that this short ORF3b protein is conserved in SARS-CoV-2’s closest coronavirus relatives, which infect bats and pangolins—scaly-skinned mammals found in Asia and Africa.
Previous work had shown that SARS-CoV ORF3b could inhibit the activation of type I interferon, so the researchers wanted to test whether SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b and related proteins could do the same. They produced a number of ORF3b proteins in human cells and then infected the cells with a mouse respiratory virus that causes a robust immune response in culture. The ORF3b proteins that were best at inhibiting the interferon response were from SARS-CoV-2 and closely related coronaviruses, as well as two proteins from bat viruses related to SARS-CoV that also had shorter ORF3b proteins. When they introduced a premature stop codon into the SARS-CoV ORF3b coding sequence, the resulting 135-amino acid protein was better at suppressing type I interferon than the wildtype SARS-CoV protein was.
“At first, honestly, we just imagined that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b does not possess the ability to hamper the activation of type I interferon” because of its short length, Sato tells The Scientist. “But the answer was completely opposite to our hypothesis. It was unbelievable that a 22–amino acid protein suppresses type I interferon.”
While it appeared that shorter ORF3b proteins were better at helping the virus duck host immune responses, there wasn’t a linear relationship between length and efficacy. When the team removed the premature stop codons along the length of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b sequence to produce proteins 57, 79, 119, and 155 amino acids long in cell culture, all of these except the longest one were better able to suppress the interferon response in cells than the wildtype 22–amino acid ORF3b protein was.
The researchers also determined that at least two COVID-19 patients in Ecuador were infected with a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that encodes a 56-amino-acid-long ORF3b protein. One of the patients died, but Sato cautions “that there is no direct evidence indicating that such quasi-species (encoding the extended ORF3b) are highly pathogenic.”
Studying viral proteins in culture is informative, but it’s not yet clear if blocking ORF3b would help treat the disease, says Priya Luthra, a virologist at the Trudeau Institute in New York who did not participate in the study. Some people with COVID-19 experience a robust, dysregulated innate immune response, she adds, but “the key question is what is really causing this dysregulation in the patients?”

Losing Touch: Another Drawback of the COVID-19 Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FG TRADE
I
t had been seven weeks since I’d touched another human being. Arms outstretched, I walked quickly toward my dad, craving his embrace. In the instant before we touched, we paused, our minds probably running quick, last-minute calculations on the risk of physical contact. But, after turning our faces away from each other and awkwardly shuffling closer, we finally connected. Wrapped in my dad’s bear hug, I momentarily forgot we were in the midst of the worst global crisis I have ever experienced.
“Touch is the most powerful safety signal of togetherness,” says Steve Cole, a psychiatrist and biobehavioral scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Like more than 35 million other Americans, I live alone, and with the guidelines of physical distancing set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I hadn’t been getting close to anyone to avoid being infected with (or potentially spreading) SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. I’d been working, thankfully, at home and staying connected with friends and family through Zoom and Skype, but those virtual interactions were no replacement for being with loved ones in person.
“When we get lonely and isolated our brainstem recognizes that suddenly we are in insecure territory and flips on a bunch of fight-or-flight stress responses without us even knowing it,” Cole says. “There’s all sorts of things in our social world that lead us to calculate that we are either safe or unsafe. You can think of physical touch, supportive and affectionate touch, as the most fundamental signal that you’re with somebody who cares about you . . . a fundamental signal of safety and well-being.”
What touch does to the immune system
Stress, which for many of us during the coronavirus pandemic has grown considerably, can flood the body with hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, as part of the fight-or-flight response. Left to build up over time, those accumulating stress hormones can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and growing levels of anxiety.
Touch is hitting all of the right buttons to affect physiological processes that are that are critically important to keeping us healthy.
—John Capitanio, University of California, Davis
The feeling of security that comes with holding hands or hugging is a result of a cascade of physical and biochemical changes in the body and the brain that can counter the fight-or-flight response. Tiffany Field, the director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, has been studying that cascade of changes for more than three decades, focusing mainly on the effects of massage. What she and others have shown is that anything that moves the skin with a bit of pressure—hugging, holding hands, massage—stimulates pressure receptors beneath the skin. Those receptors then send electrical signals to the vagus nerve, a superhighway of the nervous system with thoroughfares leading to nearly every organ of the body and a direct line into the brainstem, which automatically regulates breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate.
When the vagus nerve gets touch signals and directs them to the brainstem, it, in turn, sends another set of signals to slow the heart and nervous system, Field says. The body then tamps down the amount of stress hormones it produces. 
With levels of cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone, on the decline, “you’re saving natural killer cells,” Field says. Cortisol, studies suggest, may repress the ability of natural killer cells to secrete proteins that aid in immune cell migration and in the initiation of cell death pathways in infected cells or cancerous cells. In Field’s studies in men with HIV and women with breast cancer, she found that massage resulted in a 30 percent reduction in cortisol, which in turn led to increased activity of natural killer cells.
Bolstering that connection between touch and the immune system is a study, published online in 2014, that found that hugging might lower a person’s susceptibility to infection by viruses that cause the symptoms of a common cold. In the experiment, Carnegie Mellon University psychologist Sheldon Cohen and colleagues asked more than 400 adults to complete a questionnaire to assess their perceived emotional support, specifically if participants felt they had trusted companions to listen to their problems or to spend time with doing activities they both enjoyed. The team then called the study participants each night for 14 nights to record their levels of daily interpersonal conflict and the number of hugs they received. Next, the volunteers had either rhinovirus or influenza A sprayed into their noses, and the team assessed how they responded to infection. Having higher stress and lower levels of social support was tied to the participants’ risk of getting sick. Having more frequent hugs was also associated with a decreased risk of infection, the researchers showed.
Touch is “hitting all of the right buttons to affect physiological processes that are critically important to keeping us healthy,” says John Capitanio, a psychologist and primatologist at the University of California, Davis. The benefits are so great that in the past few years people have begun paying for platonic cuddle time, according to The Washington Post.
What touch does to the brain
As cortisol eases up and heart rate slows down, nerve cells release the neurotransmitter serotonin in response to affectionate touch. “Serotonin is the body’s natural antidepressant and antipain chemical,” Field says. 
Affectionate touch with a bit of pressure also leads to better sleep, and better sleep lowers the body’s emission of the neurotransmitter substance P, which transmits pain. Touch, Field says, can also increase dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward, and oxytocin, often called the cuddle hormone. A number of studies show that when a couple hugs each other before a stressful task, cortisol decreases and oxytocin increases, she explains. Touch from a trusted person, for example, buffers the usual effects of stress leading to the feeling of more pain.
Our brainwaves are also influenced by touch. One of Field’s studies showed that medical school students who received short chair massages experienced changes to their brainwaves in the direction of relaxation. Theta waves, which are representative of relaxation, increased, as did the students’ cognitive performance. They were able to do a mathematical computation in half the time and with higher accuracy, on average, after receiving the chair massage.
This kind of research clearly shows the importance of touch, Capitanio says. “It affects our nervous system. It affects our immune system. It affects hormonal systems. It affects a lot of different stuff.”
Pressure matters
How the skin is touched is important. Field’s research has shown that light touches or strokes on the skin are arousing, increasing the heart rate and generating more beta, instead of theta, waves in the brain. It’s similar with babies born prematurely; if you lightly stroke them, they’ll arch their backs, whimper, and scrunch up their faces. Apply a little pressure, however, and the babies remain relaxed, receptive to the touch. In the long-term, they gain weight more easily and have better overall health than those not getting a massage. “It seems counterintuitive for premature babies because they seem so fragile,” she says, “but it has benefits.” 
The same logic applies to individuals craving touch in the face of the anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Field suggests. Her studies have repeatedly shown that affectionate touch with a bit of pressure can ease anxiety. And, Field notes, that type of touch doesn’t even have to come from another individual. You can do it to yourself with a self-massage or any moderately pressured movement of the skin, such as yoga. Even the pressure provided by exercise can help, she says.  
It’s easy to enact. . . . It’s hard to mess up.

She and her colleagues just finished conducting a survey—the results of which haven’t been published yet—to assess how people are faring during the pandemic. Of the 260 people that responded, sleep problems, fatigue, and anxiety ranked highest among the concerns. A little less than half reported feeling lonely or touched deprived, and 58 percent reported feeling isolated, with roughly 28 percent of all participants living alone. After a preliminary analysis of the data, the team has found that “exercise is related to all the positive measures that we took,” Field says, and none of the negative ones. Yoga, for example, stimulates those pressure receptors under the skin that send signals to the vagus nerve and kicks off the cascade of touch-based benefits. “Exercise is turning out to be the most positive thing to do,” she says.
The touch of another
But exercise or self-massage may not be enough to alleviate anxiety, some scientists suggest. Capitanio, a primatologist, says, “sociability is embedded in our genes.” Humans share a common ancestor with rhesus macaques dating to millions of years ago, and that ancestor, according to the fossil record, was a social creature living in groups, just as macaques do today and as humans tend to do too. “Sociality has been a really important part of our biology for millions of years,” Capitanio says, and touch is a part of that sociability. 
Brooke Feeney, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University, agrees. She was not part of the team that ran the study on hugging and risk of viral infection, but she has spent a considerable amount of time researching touch and has found it to be a “simple yet effective intervention for improving relationships and enhancing social connection,” she writes in an email to The Scientist. Her work suggests that not only is the physical sensation of touch important, but so is the meaning behind it.
“When someone is touched affectionately, they interpret the meaning of that touch. Affectionate touch typically communicates that someone is available to be supportive as needed, and it communicates that one is valued and accepted. It is a salient reminder that one is valued, included, accepted, loved and cared for,” she says. “It indicates that one is included in a social group. And a reminder of one relational connection, through a simple touch, can increase the salience of one’s social inclusion broadly, promoting feelings of security and having health-protective effects.”
Affectionate touch is the optimal form of offering support, says Feeney, who is also currently conducting a survey on the social effects of COVID-19. “It’s easy to enact. . . . It’s hard to mess up.”
Biogen Uses its Own Superspreader Event to Aid COVID-19 Research/-/ABOVE: COURTESY BIOGEN
I
n late February, as the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the US, the biotech company Biogen became an unwitting superspreader. More than 100 Biogen leaders and executives had attended a leadership meeting in Massachusetts on February 26 and 27. When the executives flew home—to Europe, Asia, and across the US—they spread SARS-CoV-2 to their families and coworkers, seeding new outbreaks. According to the official count, 99 people living in Massachusetts alone were infected with SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the Biogen meeting. The total number of people infected in the US and around the world is higher.
The company chose to capitalize on its early COVID-19 misfortune by helping others with their research. “Several Biogen employees, who at the time were still recovering from COVID-19, began to consider ways they could offer their own anonymized medical information to research efforts,” explains Maha Radhakrishnan, the chief medical officer at Biogen, in an email to The Scientist. “We realized we were in a unique position to contribute to advancing COVID-19 science in an organized and deliberate way.”
On April 16, Biogen announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Partners HealthCare, and several local hospitals to develop a COVID-19 biobank. Biogen employees and their close contacts could volunteer to donate blood samples to researchers at the Broad Institute, who would use the tissue to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers at the Broad Institute collect blood and clinical history from volunteers. Those with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are called back to give additional samples.
The Biogen cohort was of particular interest to researchers for several reasons. As Ramnik Xavier, an immunologist at the Broad Institute and a member of the COVID-19 Biobank Steering Committee, explains, the infections occurred during a defined time frame within a closed environment. This makes it possible to study patterns of infection.
Another unique feature of the Biogen cohort is that among employees and contacts known to be infected, the cases were nearly all mild and didn’t require hospitalization. As Xavier explains, people infected with SARS-CoV-2 produce antibodies in response, but only a subset of those people produce antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus, according to data from the Biogen biobank and other studies. “A question out there is, do patients make high-titer neutralizing antibodies following a mild infection, or is it less common than after a severe infection that requires hospitalization?”
The biobank also collects blood from Biogen employees and close contacts who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but didn’t develop an infection. Researchers are using those samples to search for determinants of COVID-19 infection and disease severity.
To date, around 150 volunteers have signed up: an anonymized mix of Biogen employees and their close contacts. Over the past few weeks, about 30 volunteers have given blood samples, and Xavier says the team plans to finish the first round of sampling within the next few weeks.
Although Biogen spearheaded the development of the project, Radhakrishnan explains over email that the biobank is structured to protect the privacy of Biogen employees who take part. “Biogen will have the same level of access to the Biobank as researchers around the world, which means it will not have access to identifiable information.”
Academic groups wishing to use the biobank data for their own research can submit proposals to the steering committee. There are several other COVID-19 biobanks, such as the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogenic Readiness, collecting samples from hospitalized patients. Researchers around the US are using biobank samples to develop monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 and to standardize serological assays.  
Correction (May 19): The article now notes that the biobank is collecting samples from employees and their close contacts, not strictly family members. The Scientist regrets the error.

his situation seems familiar, but somehow different. As scientists, we are used to adversity. Stay in the field long enough and you are sure to experience funding shortfalls, rejected papers and grants, and a nagging uncertainty about whether you are working on the best problem or taking the right approach. Success requires perseverance, and we have all had ample opportunities to practice patience and perseverance in our careers. Yet this situation is different.
In the past, the solution to my difficulties lay within myself. If I lacked an idea, I could look through the literature for inspiration. If I wrote a poorly received paper, it was up to me to figure out the disconnect between me and the reviewers. I had the power to change me and that provided confidence in finding a solution. Perhaps it was difficult, but the possibility that I could find a solution brought a degree of comfort.
Today, the problem is not a disconnect within me. It is a disconnect from other people. The coronavirus has taken hundreds of thousands of lives and sickened millions as of this writing. At Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where I work, only about 10 percent of the staff are allowed on campus, mostly to keep the facilities operating, but some to perform critical experiments. The rest of us are working remotely, holding virtual meetings and being productive, but I am separated from my scientific colleagues, and I am surprised at how much I miss them.
Science is typically perceived to be a solitary activity. We’re likely all familiar with the stereotype of the distracted, poorly groomed, and socially awkward scientist obsessing over a problem that consumes their attention. Reading papers, listening to seminars, designing experiments, sifting through reams of data to find the nugget of knowledge that has eluded others. Other people are distractions. They are competitors for funding, space, and priorities. Students and postdocs are responsibilities, taking up valuable time and resources. They are not supposed to be so important.
We are a community that needs to be connected to each other to best learn, understand, and advance knowledge.
Despite the common perception that science is a product of an individual’s vision, knowledge, and perseverance, it is also a deeply social activity. Individual researchers can generate knowledge, but that knowledge requires input from colleagues to be useful and deemed important. We cannot do science in isolation any more than an artist can be satisfied by creating works that no one will see. We basic scientists do science for other scientists, and the greatest joy we experience is to have others acknowledge our work and to build on it. Conversely, we are inspired by others and use their work as a foundation for our own. We are all connected to other scientists, and those connections sustain us.
That is why I find the current situation so unsettling. I have lost part of what sustained me as a scientist. The Zoom meetings are life support, bread to someone who is used to dining at great restaurants. It will keep us alive, but it will not let us thrive.
I miss my colleagues. Getting together in conference rooms and brainstorming ideas or going over the weekly experimental results. Seeing seminars in person, where my attention is drawn by the speaker and their interaction with the frequently skeptical, but sometimes impressed audience. Listening to Zoom seminars while culling my email folder just doesn’t cut it. I also miss scientific meetings, visiting scientists, and most of all, the spontaneous interactions with my fellow researchers where we enthusiastically shared the latest discovery, insight, or inspiration. It was the food that nourished my scientific soul.
Like all adversity, the current situation will someday end. They say that you learn more from adversity than success, and I have found that mostly to be true. So I am optimistic that our current social isolation will have a silver lining. If it does, it will likely be our shared appreciation for how much we need each other. What makes science so satisfying and worth all of the sacrifices is other scientists. We are a community that needs to be connected to each other to best learn, understand, and advance knowledge. If we all come out of this with a better appreciation of the need for collaborations, open science, and real honesty and integrity, then it will be easier for me to be patient for this to end.
I can hardly wait!

It’s So Hard to Know Who’s Dying of COVID-19—and When/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SUDOK1
E
very day for seven weeks since the end of March, the British government published a comparison of COVID-19 deaths in different countries. Last week, it stopped. A government spokesperson claimed that’s because ministers “varied the content and format” of the information they present to the public, according to news reports. Critics point out this need for variety only arose after the line on the graph to indicate cumulative UK deaths climbed above that of every other European country.
According to the most recent tallies from May 12, 32,692 people in the UK had lost their lives to the disease. That compares with 30,911 in Italy, 26,920 in Spain, 26,643 in France, and 7,667 in Germany. In the United States the recorded toll on that date was 81,779 deaths.
You can draw some very misleading conclusions if you don’t take into account that most of the data is by date of [death] registration and not date of [death] occurrence.
—David Leon, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
Those data look precise but they are anything but. Epidemiologists are fond of saying that all models are wrong but some are useful. The same is true for mortality statistics. Public health officials have long battled with inconsistent and delayed reporting of deaths, even within different regions of the same country. And that long-standing issue now poses a problem for researchers trying to track the pandemic and understand its implications.
“Every country’s vital registration system is different and no country’s vital registration system is perfect,” says Mark Hayward, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on mortality statistics. “They all have their own built-in quirks and lags.”
See “Watch the Spread of COVID-19”
The problems start with identifying the cause of death and attributing it—or not—to COVID-19. Countries such as the Netherlands count only those individuals who died in the hospital after testing positive for the virus. Neighboring Belgium includes deaths in the community and everyone who died after showing symptoms of the disease, even if they didn’t undergo a diagnostic PCR test.
To be included in a country’s national count, each death must be registered locally and then recorded in a more centralized accounting system. Or systems. Different places do this in their own way too. At the start of the outbreak, UK government figures presented only deaths recorded electronically in the National Health Service (NHS) hospital network. At the end of April, they were extended to include a separate set of figures collected by the Office of National Statistics of community deaths, chiefly in care homes.
Reports of community deaths tend to take longer to collate than those from hospitals do. “In the United States they are based on counts from counties that are provided,” Hayward says. There are around 3,000 counties in the US. “You can imagine the different types of counties and how fast they can get mortality information, collect it, code it, and report it. It takes a while to roll this information up.”
In some national systems, the delay is because reports are still sent in by fax or post. 
Sometimes it can take several days to identify and inform family members, who tend to be told first, before the death report is processed And in some countries—England but not Scotland, for example—any coroner-led inquiries opened to determine cause of death, common when a healthcare worker dies, must reach a conclusion before the death is officially recorded. Such a procedure can take weeks, months, even years.
What many people don’t realize, says Sheila Bird, a statistician at the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, is these delays introduce a significant lag in mortality data. So, reported deaths for a given day or week—say, the week ending today—don’t typically reveal the number of people who died in the past seven days. They show only the number of people whose deaths were recorded that week. And in some cases these people died weeks or even months before.
“It is potentially important for some occupations that we may be undercounting the number of deaths,” Bird tells The Scientist—specifically, work-related deaths that would be referred to a coroner.
For some research, the delay—while not ideal—does not prevent useful analysis on mortality data. Maher El Chaar, a bariatric surgeon at St. Luke’s University Health Network in Pennsylvania, has used death statistics from New York City to compare fatalities among COVID-19 patients from different ethnic groups. He found that African Americans and Hispanics had the highest death rates, which he says is linked to higher occurrence of obesity in those communities.
“They may not be the most up-to-date figures and in our paper we said those figures are true up to a certain date,” he says. “That makes some comparisons very difficult. But in our study the way they were collecting the data was consistent among the different ethnic groups. However, we could not take those numbers are compare them to the same ethnic groups in different states or different countries.”
Nowcasting points to the true peak of COVID-19 deaths

The lag in mortality data poses more of a problem for policy makers who want to, say, ease or enforce lockdown restrictions at short-notice based on real-time information on rising or falling death rates. (Confirmed new cases of the disease aren’t much use for that either, because those figures are heavily influenced by the numbers of tests carried out from week-to-week.)
At the end of April, researchers in the UK and Germany re-analysed hospital deaths in England for that month by the date of actual death, not recorded death. They found that 10 percent of the deaths took longer than five days to appear in the official statistics, and that for many days only a fraction of the deaths reported for a 24-hour period actually happened in that timeframe. For example, 801 people died of COVID-19 in English hospitals on April 8, but only 140 of those deaths were reported quickly enough to be included in the daily deaths announced for that day.
David Leon, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who worked on that study, says, “You can draw some very misleading conclusions if you don’t take into account that most of the data is by date of [death] registration and not date of [death] occurrence.” Data arranged by date of actual death show a distinct peak and decline in hospital deaths after April 8, according to Leon’s analysis—a feature obscured in the official figures that show instead a far fuzzier plateau, with ups and downs.
Behind the scenes, Bird says, policy makers and their advisers will be using statistical tricks to account for the lag in the death data to present a more reliable, real-time indication of fatalities. A common technique is called nowcasting, which uses the typical statistical distribution of time lags in past recording of deaths to add expected delayed reports to a daily figure.
In the UK, the government has not published the results of such real-time death estimates. But Bird’s group calculates and posts online its own version of nowcasted daily English hospital deaths. “It’s a response to the fact that these are such important data they ought to be in the public domain,” she says. “And the version that is in the public domain ought to be statistically competent.” 
Moderna’s Coronavirus Vaccine Spurs Immune Response: Early Data/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SEFA OZEL
A
candidate coronavirus vaccine tested in people appears to be safe and can generate an immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Drugmaker Moderna, which is developing the vaccine, announced the results today (May 18).
The results are based on a Phase 1 clinical trial of the vaccine, which was given in two doses to eight healthy volunteers. The recipients tolerated the vaccine well, with no major health issues. Only one suffered from redness around the injection site. 
All of the volunteers made antibodies in response to the vaccine, and when those antibodies were tested in human cells in the lab, they stopped SARS-CoV-2 from replicating, which means they neutralized the virus. The levels of the neutralizing antibodies in the volunteers’ bodies were similar to levels observed in the blood samples, or sera, of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.
“The fact that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody amounts comparable or higher to those found in convalescent sera [plasma] is very encouraging,” Arturo Casadevall, the chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who is not involved in developing the Moderna vaccine, tells The Washington Post.
The results are promising enough for Moderna to move forward and start a Phase 2 clinical trial, Robin Robinson, the chief scientific officer at RenovaCare, tells STAT. Robinson is a former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a US government agency partnered with Moderna to help with develop its vaccine. A Phase 2 clinical trial of the vaccine will begin soon, according to the company, and a Phase 3 trial is slated to start in July.
Both STAT and the Post report that some scientists want to see more of the Phase 1 trial data, such as how long the high levels of antibodies last. Studies indicate that patients who recover from COVID-19 do not maintain high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine tells the Post. Individuals need high levels of the antibodies to counteract the virus, so a vaccine would need to make antibodies that last, according to the Post.
See “COVID-19 Vaccine Frontrunners”
The clinical trial helped Moderna narrow in on the optimal dose of the vaccine. Volunteers received either 25, 100, or 250 micrograms  of lipid nanoparticles bearing mRNA transcripts for the coronavirus’s spike protein, delivered in a 0.5 milliliter shot. The results of individuals’ immune response are only available for the low- and medium-level doses. The highest dose caused fever, muscle aches, and headaches. In the statement, the company says it will focus on 50 microgram and 100 microgram doses in future studies.
“I think 25 [micrograms] gets us there but you always want to have somewhat of a margin,” Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, tells STAT. “The sense is at the end of the day we’re going to narrow it down on somewhere between 25 and 100,” he says. “It’s going to be really hard math for us.”
The math is important in order to produce a vaccine that protects everyone, including older individuals who have immune systems that don’t response as well to inoculation as younger people’s do, while also using the least amount of supplies possible.
“The lower the dose, the more vaccine we’ll be able to make,” Zaks tells The New York Times. 
If the upcoming clinical trials are successful, the vaccine could be ready to administer later this year or early next year. It’s not clear how many doses will be ready by then, Zaks says. “We’re doing our best to make it as many millions as possible.”
SARS-CoV-2–Fighting T Cells Found in Recovered Patients/-/ABOVE: The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

E
ven as researchers around the world rush to develop a vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19, and some pin their hopes on the idea that enough people will recover from infections to achieve herd immunity in the meantime, questions about whether exposure to the virus induces immunity to it have lingered. If the virus itself does not prompt immunity, a vaccine against it might not either. 
Although it doesn’t provide a conclusive answer, a study published yesterday (May 14) in Cell appears to be good news on the immunity front. Researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California took blood from 20 adults who’d recovered from COVID-19 and exposed the samples to proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All of the patients had CD4+ helper T cells that recognized the virus’s spike protein, and 70 percent of them had CD8+ killer T cells that responded to the same protein. “Our data show that the virus induces what you would expect from a typical, successful antiviral response,” says coauthor Shane Crotty in an institute press release. 
The authors also tested blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018 to see whether people who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 might nevertheless have some immunity to it. They detected CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in about half of those samples, which they suggest could be due to exposure to other coronaviruses that cause a cold. 
Science notes that the results align with those of another study, led by researchers at Charité University Hospital in Berlin and reported in a preprint last month, that found CD4+ T cells that recognized the spike protein in blood from 83 percent of COVID-19 patients and 34 percent of healthy people tested.  
“This is encouraging data,” Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen, who was not involved in either study, tells Science. Although not conclusive, the T cell response “bodes well for the development of long-term protective immunity” among people who have recovered from COVID-19, she says, and could be useful in designing vaccines. 
The results suggest that “one reason that a large chunk of the population may be able to deal with the virus is that we may have some small residual immunity from our exposure to common cold viruses,” viral immunologist Steven Varga of the University of Iowa tells Science. But neither study tested whether that is the case.

Droplets from Speech Can Float in Air for Eight Minutes: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ZORANM
A
mid concerns that COVID-19 may be spread through aerosols, scientists have shown that tiny respiratory droplets produced when people talk can linger in the air for minutes. The results, published in PNAS yesterday (May 13), did not examine the transmission of viruses in spray from speech, but bolsters the idea that talking could present a risk for exposure to the novel coronavirus.
“This study builds on earlier research by the same team showing that speaking may factor into transmission of SARS-CoV-2,” a spokesperson for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, where most of the study’s authors are based, tells USA Today.
The authors used laser light sheets to capture on video the movement of small droplets emitted from a person’s mouth as the speaker repeated the phrase “stay healthy” for 25 seconds. They calculated that the half-life of these particles in the air, considering the time it took them to fall 30 cm, was eight minutes.
“This study is the most accurate measure of the size, number and frequency of droplets that leave the mouth during a normal conversation and shower any listeners within range,” Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana who was not involved in the research, tells The Washington Post.
See “How COVID-19 Is Spread”
The researchers did not examine these respiratory droplets in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. But in their paper they write that in a scenario where an infected person is in the vicinity of uninfected people, “At an average viral load of 7 × 106 per milliliter, we estimate that 1 min of loud speaking generates at least 1,000 virion-containing droplet nuclei that remain airborne for more than 8 min. These therefore could be inhaled by others and, according to IAH [independent action hypothesis], trigger a new SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
The airborne particles were about 4 µm in diameter, and had dehydrated from respiratory droplets that the authors estimate were larger than 12 µm in diameter when they left the speaker’s mouth. 
The spokesperson for National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases suggests to USA Today that the study’s results support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation to wear a mask. Although many governments have ordered or urged residents to don masks, it’s not clear how well they prevent the transmission of the coronavirus. N95 masks filter 95 percent of particles larger than 0.3 µm (according to an early report describing COVID-19 infections, the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles range from 0.6 to 0.14 µm in diameter, and N95 masks can capture particles of this size). For other types of masks, that efficiency varies considerably. An analysis of materials used in home-made masks found a wide range in their ability to block particles about 0.1 µm in size, from just 7 percent for two layers of quilters’ cotton to 84 percent for a mask made from a nanofiber layer paired with cotton ripstop. 
A study published in April that asked patients to cough into either surgical masks or cotton masks found neither “effectively filtered SARS–CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients.” Other researchers have found that masking policies correlate with fewer COVID-19 cases, and estimate that widespread uptake of the use of masks could considerably limit infections.
Clarification (May 15): In the penultimate paragraph we clarified that N95 masks are able to capture particles smaller than 0.3 µm.

Countries Begin Large-Scale Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BLUEBERRIES
S
cientists in Spain are expecting to begin regularly analyzing sewage for traces of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, The Scientist has learned. Pending budget approval from AXA or national funds in Spain, researchers will carry out the work for at least a whole year, having signed a special agreement with authorities in the Valencian Community, a region on Spain’s eastern coast that is home to nearly 5 million people. 
It will involve the twice-weekly collection of samples from more than 250 wastewater treatment plants, says lead researcher Pilar Domingo-Calap, a biologist at the University of Valencia. Already, her team is sampling from 20 facilities in a preliminary phase of the project.
Previously, Domingo-Calap and colleagues had reported the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 traces circulating in Valencian wastewater that had been sampled on February 24—around the time the first COVID-19 cases were officially confirmed in mainland Spain. They published their findings in a preprint on medRxiv April 29. The samples used in that work came from three large water treatment plants serving around 1 million residents living in the city of Valencia.
“Now we’re going to monitor the full region,” says Domingo-Calap, pointing out that this will cover the provinces of Alicante, Castellón, and Valencia itself, once full funding for the project is confirmed.

It’s one of the first such programs to be planned on a large scale. In recent months, various researchers in several countries including the US, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, and France have all reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, suggesting that sewage monitoring could allow authorities to detect fresh outbreaks and keep an eye on existing ones. 
These efforts are now moving beyond mere proofs of concept. Besides the Spanish project, similar programs are also set to be launched in Australia, with individual states deciding when and how to roll out monitoring. The state of Victoria, for example, will begin this work at scale in June. And authorities in the UK have said they are actively investigating the possibility of tracking the virus via sewage.
Wastewater detection involves taking small samples of untreated sewage, which may contain traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The samples are not thought to contain infectious virus particles but rather viral RNA, which is detected using RT-qPCR in a laboratory. 
This is exactly what Domingo-Calap and her colleagues did back in April, although they used samples stored at 4 °C, the oldest of which dated to February 12. It did not contain evidence of the virus but the subsequent sample, from February 24, did. 
“We were lucky because they keep some samples for a month and a half,” says Domingo-Calap, who had already been working with Valencian wastewater treatment plants as part of a project to study the presence of bacteriophages in wastewater.
The preprint she and her colleagues published revealed that SARS-CoV-2 may have been circulating in mainland Spanish communities earlier than previously thought. 
A similar survey by researchers in Italy, published on medRxiv May 7, reported that a single wastewater sample from Milan contained traces of the virus just a few days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 community transmission was reported in the country.
Domingo-Calap and her coauthors note that they also tested treated wastewater for viral RNA but, as expected, did not find any in those samples. This is because disinfection generally removes traces of viruses and other pathogens from sewage water. 
Such work raises the possibility that surveillance of untreated wastewater could quickly reveal emerging outbreaks of COVID-19 in some areas. It might also help authorities understand the extent to which transmission has occurred, suggests Domingo-Calap.
“The number of [officially confirmed] cases was really low compared with the concentration of RNA we found in the water,” she explains. 
“It is a very low-cost method to give you additional epidemiological information about the spread of the virus and I think that is very useful,” says Willem van Schaik, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham.
He notes that wastewater surveillance can only give a “broad overview.” Individuals in an affected population still have to be tested directly so that health authorities can better understand the true nature of ongoing outbreaks.
While UK officials have hinted that they might launch a program similar to the one in Spain, there is no firm commitment yet, says Andrew Singer, a pollution scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
“I have a proposal that was submitted over two weeks ago now to the research council in the UK. They haven’t told me whether it’s funded yet,” he says.
“All I can say is, it does appear that the UK will be doing some form of national surveillance of wastewater. When it starts, I’m not sure. Who will be doing it, I’m not sure.”
Singer says he has read reports of SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater in other countries with interest, but for such initiatives to really be useful, methods of sampling and analysis would need to be carefully validated and standardized. For example, all researchers could agree to take a certain volume of sample wastewater at specific intervals. 
A clearer understanding of how individuals shed the virus would also be useful, adds Singer. Sharpening surveillance methods in this way would allow scientists to more accurately model the COVID-19 case load in a particular community by measuring the concentration of viral RNA in sewage, he says.
Without this clearly defined methodology, Singer says, wastewater surveillance remains a fairly simple tool but, all the same, one that could potentially inform governments about outbreaks in a timely manner.
One other question remains: if traces of the virus exist in untreated sewage, does that mean someone could catch COVID-19 from it? Aaron Packman, an environmental engineer at Northwestern University, recently said in a public statement that there was a risk of waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and that wastewater systems should be examined carefully.
However, van Schaik argues that there is little evidence that infectious coronavirus particles survive well in untreated wastewater.
“At this moment in time, I would say it’s unlikely to be a major cause for transmission because it remains a respiratory virus that spreads by coughing and sneezing,” he says.
Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, Some Scientists Bring the Bench Home/-/ABOVE: A colony of spotted wing Drosophila flies entomologist Hannah Burrack is maintaining at home

abs around the world have been closed for weeks, months in some places, as orders to shelter in place and maintain physical distancing seek to minimize the spread of COVID-19. While some scientists have turned to writing manuscripts and grants and making inventories of their freezers to keep busy while away from the bench, others have brought experiments home, turning bathrooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens into makeshift labs—sometimes seeing an opportunity to explore new questions, other times trying out of desperation to prevent projects from moving backwards.

TEAKORIGIN 
Researchers at TeakOrigin, a food-data company, created an entire initiative dubbed “lab@home.” Under normal circumstances, the company purchases thousands of fruits and vegetables from different grocers in Boston and Los Angeles and scans each piece using optical spectrometers designed to detect levels of different vitamins and nutrients. The team publishes data comparing the quality of fruits and vegetables found in each store each week online for consumers to access for free. It also partners with companies in the food supply chain to help improve the quality of the food they produce. After the analyses are done, they donate the food.
Brent Overcash, the cofounder and CEO of TeakOrigin, tells The Scientist those studies stopped in March out of an abundance of caution. “We didn’t feel good buying so much food that we normally buy in an environment where we might have scarcity,” he says.
But produce quality is just one of the company’s research projects. The spectrometers the scientists use are designed so that they can be carried into the field and used on fruits and vegetables that haven’t even been picked yet, so they can learn about the ideal times to harvest. “I can put the device on [the food,] pull the trigger, and in 30 seconds get an answer,” says Overcash. That portability has allowed his employees to turn lemons into lemonade.
Now, instead of testing huge quantities of foods, the scientists are using the scanners at home to conduct replicate analyses on smaller quantities of produce over the course of several days to see how their nutrients degrade over time. For example, strawberries may have more vitamin C than tomatoes to begin with, but as they’re waiting to be eaten, the tomatoes may end up with more.  “You learn something entirely different by scanning the same thing over and over and over, over the course of a number of days,” he says.

Steven Henikoff, who studies epigenetics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and his team were almost ready to release an updated protocol that allowed researchers to profile chromatin components using antibodies—which can reveal changes to gene expression—in a small sample or cell, using a technique that kept the sample in a single tube throughout the process, but they needed a little bit more data.
When COVID-19 prevented Henikoff from continuing experiments in the lab to collect those results, he took a few pieces of equipment home to see if the technique, CUT&Tag, would work just as well outside of a dedicated laboratory—in this case, the laundry room of his home.
“It doesn't require anything dangerous,” says Henikoff. “I thought, well, I’ll just try it out at home and see if I can get the same data, the quality, that I was getting the lab. And it turned out to be quite easy.”
He took a 10-year-old PCR machine and a microcentrifuge home from the lab, both of which fit on the counter he uses to fold clothes. He was able to run even more samples than he normally would in the lab, thanks to limited interruptions throughout the day, and his team posted its Cut&Tag@home protocol to protocols.io on April 17. 
“The reason for doing it was, basically, it’s a good opportunity to demonstrate what you could do with limited resources,” says Henikoff. “It’s very inexpensive. It lowers the barrier for getting into the game of chromatin profiling.”

HANNAH BURRACK
Hannah Burrack, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, works with a variety of insects that require care several times per week. Because her colonies contain animals that can be collected in North Carolina, they were not considered unrecoverable resources, meaning that as the university shut down to limit the spread of COVID-19, her team would not be able to enter the lab to maintain them.
But building new colonies isn’t as simple as just collecting new specimens from nature. They’d need to wait for the best season to collect them, and then maintain and grow the colonies in the lab for a year or longer before they’re ready for experiments, delaying not only her own work, but the projects of graduate students hoping to finish their dissertation experiments this year.
So Burrack and her lab manager each brought two colonies home, says Burrack, who is keeping them in an extra bathroom. If she were running experiments, it would be crucial to carefully control the temperature and humidity, but since she’s just keeping the insects alive, those that need extra humidity are placed over pans of water, and she doesn’t worry much about the temperature. “Neither of them are at their ideal temperature right now,” she says, referring to the tobacco budworm caterpillars and spotted wing Drosophila living in her shower. “Because we’re not running experiments where environmental conditions are going to be a mitigating factor, I’m not concerned about it. They’re reproducing and surviving just fine.”
While Burrack’s lab had colonies of seven different insects, she and her lab manager only brought home the four associated with graduate student research and left the rest behind. “Any other projects we’re basically deemphasizing for the rest of the year, because if we’re able to get back in, we want to make sure our students can make adequate progress and satisfy the requirements of the grants that are funding them,” she says.
Even with a pared-down number of subjects, it’s a lot of work. Normally, Burrack would pay an undergraduate student to spend 15 hours a week maintaining the colonies. “This isn’t something I wanted to burden our students with because they were in the middle of transitioning to taking online courses or teaching online courses, and also had a lot of personal anxiety and concern about how their degree program was going to progress,” she says, but “the time and energy that I’m spending with just basic insect husbandry is time that I’m not able to spend writing, doing research.”
Henikoff echoed the sentiment. While he’s happy with his results, “it wasn’t like I was looking for stuff to do at home. . . . I’m running a lab and doing grant reviews,” he says. “I just wanted to get something accomplished that I couldn’t do otherwise during the COVID-19.”
Cal State University to Conduct Most Classes Online this Fall/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PASTORSCOTT
T
he California State University system is planning to offer most of its classes online in the fall semester, amid fears of a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections later this year, according to a statement made yesterday (May 12) by the university’s chancellor, Timothy White. Comprising 23 campuses serving nearly 500,000 students, CSU is the largest university system to announce such sweeping measures in advance of next year.
“First and foremost is the health, safety and welfare of our students, faculty and staff, and the evolving data surrounding the progression of COVID-19,” White says in the statement. “Virtual planning is necessary because it might not be possible for some students, faculty and staff to safely travel to campus. Said another way, this virtual planning approach preserves as many options for as many students as possible.”
The University of California (UC) said yesterday that it will probably pursue a similar strategy. “It’s likely none of our campuses will fully re-open in fall,” UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook writes in an email to CNN. “[UC] will be exploring a mixed approach with some material delivered in the classroom and labs settings while other classes will continue to be online.”
For now, universities planning all or partially online fall semesters remain in the minority nationwide. Of more than 350 institutions whose policies have been collected in a database by The Chronicle of Higher Education, nearly 70 percent are planning for in-person classes, while less than 15 percent are planning to hold all or some classes online.

The move to online teaching may bring its own problems for universities if it leads to a drop in student numbers—for example, if students defer their applications until in-person teaching resumes. US institutions have already raised concerns about reduced enrollment of international students due to travel restrictions brought on by the pandemic. Institutions could be facing “an incredible financial hit,” Dick Startz, an economist at UC, Santa Barbara, told The Scientist last month.
See “The Pandemic’s Effects on Recruiting International STEM Trainees”  
Some universities are already turning to wait lists to try to shore up student numbers, The New York Times reports. “People are coming off wait lists all over the place right now,” Debra Felix, a student advisor and former admissions director at Columbia University, tells the Times. “It tells me that the yeses are coming back very slowly, or people are getting back to them quickly with noes.”
Loss of Smell, Taste May Be Reliable Predictor of COVID-19: Study/-/ABOVE: ZOE GLOBAL LIMITED
A
smartphone app that allows individuals to report symptoms of illness is effective in predicting whether or not they have COVID-19. A loss of smell and taste appears to be one of the clearest indicators of infection, researchers reported yesterday (May 11) in Nature Medicine.
The impairment of these senses is “just such a weird symptom that doesn’t occur with most other diseases so it’s rarely wrong,” Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and a lead author of the study, tells The New York Times.
See “Lost Smell and Taste Hint COVID-19 Can Target the Nervous System”
In the new study, Spector and his colleagues reviewed self-reported data from more than 2.5 million people living in the United States and the United Kingdom. Participants recorded health information on a daily basis, revealing if they were asymptomatic or symptomatic, if they’d been hospitalized, if they had pre-existing medical conditions, and if they had been tested for an active infection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The users recorded their data on an app, called the Covid Symptom Study, between March 24 and April 21, and in that time, more than 18,000 individuals provided COVID-19 diagnostic test results. 
Of the 7,178 who tested positive for coronavirus infection, 4,668—65 percent—reported a loss of smell and taste. About 20 percent of the participants with negative tests reported a loss of smell and taste.
The team analyzed all of the data from UK users to identify independent symptoms that most strongly correlated with COVID-19 and adjusted the results for age, sex, and BMI. An impairment in taste and smell, extreme fatigue, cough, and a loss of appetite were the best indicators of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using that information, the team developed a formula to predict if users had the disease or not and applied it to the more than 800,000 app users who reported any symptoms. According to the formula, roughly 140,000 of them probably had COVID-19. The formula was nearly 80 percent accurate at predicting whether or not an app user had COVID-19 based on a positive diagnostic test.
Although it featured prominently in the study, the loss of taste and smell is considered a less common symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to the World Health Organization. The results of the new study indicate it should be bumped up to one of the most common symptoms, which include fever and cough. In the app, those symptoms ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, as predictors of COVID-19. The study results also imply that a loss of smell and taste could be used to determine who to screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Because of the app’s success in predicting cases, the team suggests it could be a valuable tool for public health officials to use to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early on and to encourage individuals with those symptoms to self-quarantine, so they don’t spread COVID-19 to others.
“At the moment, we’re mostly gathering data on the tip of the iceberg from those who are really sick and show up at the hospital. But there is a huge iceberg below of people with mild symptoms who we know are major culprits for community spread,” coauthor Andrew Chan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, tells the Times. “We have no ability to track these people at home and that’s a real problem.” 
John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital, agrees. He wasn’t involved with the new app but has used others to track influenza and COVID-19 and says these tools are important for identifying an outbreak before individuals start arriving at hospitals.  
“Because we have such a lack of testing, this kind of data is going to give us insights into symptomatology, hot spots and the impact of social distancing,” he tells the Times. “Without this information, how are communities supposed to know we’re on the other side of this pandemic and whether we can reopen?”
Support for Vaccine Challenge Trials Gains Momentum/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BILL OXFORD

n the movie Contagion, a researcher from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention goes rogue after seeing that a vaccine candidate has worked in a monkey. She injects herself with the formula and then goes to visit her father, who is hospitalized with the fictional virus MEV-1, to expose herself to the pathogen. She doesn’t fall ill, and the success of her risky act accelerates the rollout of a vaccine against the virus.
Contagion fans have noted a number of parallels between the movie’s fictional disease and COVID-19, and deliberate exposure to test a vaccine’s efficacy may be the next one. Some researchers are advocating for a more systematic version of the film’s approach, and the idea is gaining traction. The World Health Organization released guidelines last week on how such “challenge trials” might be conducted, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is holding a meeting today (May 11) of a working group charged with drafting “a perspective on the scientific and practical considerations for a Covid-19 human challenge model,” the Financial Times reports.  
Ordinarily, “Safety of a vaccine must be confirmed by extensive animal work, followed by the inoculation of dozens of humans, then escalating to thousands,” write vaccine consultant Stanley Plotkin and New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan in an upcoming article in the journal Vaccine. “That process normally takes months to years, during which SARS-2 will infect and possibly kill millions. Acceleration of that standard process is necessary.” They go on to propose human challenge trials as a way of achieving that acceleration.  
A similar argument was laid out in late March by a bioethicist and two epidemiologists in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, and last month by a bipartisan group of 35 US Representatives who urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider approving such trials. 
The FDA would not comment when asked by NBC News if any plans for such trials have been submitted for approval, and no human challenge trials are yet underway in the US. NBC reports that the multinational testing company SGS and London-based hVIVO are planning such studies. More than 15,000 people worldwide have submitted their information to a website collecting names of potential volunteers for a human challenge trial. 
Some bioethicists tell NBC there isn’t yet enough information available to determine whether conducting such a trial would be ethical. And beyond ethical and legal issues, there are significant logistical challenges to conducting such an experiment. Vaccine researcher Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine tells BuzzFeed that researchers would, for example, need to determine the minimum dose of virus that should be given and standardize the “challenge” virus and its delivery. Completing such steps will take time. 
“A challenge study captures the imagination,” bioethicist Seema Shah of Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago tells NBC. “But they have to work in a larger ecosystem of research, and we can’t pin all of our hopes on them.”
The Unusual Symptoms of COVID-19/-/Some patients with COVID-19 have low blood oxygen levels, but lack the symptoms that typically accompany hypoxia.

n late April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its list of COVID-19 symptoms. The CDC initially listed fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the defining clinical aspects of COVID-19, but the agency now recognizes that repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and a loss of taste or smell may accompany an infection.
With the virus and clinical research moving at breakneck speed, researchers are observing more symptoms, with mounting evidence that the disease presents differently depending on the patient’s age. Many of these symptoms remain rare, and scientists don’t yet know if they are directly caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
See “Receptors for SARS-CoV-2 Present in Wide Variety of Human Cells”
Multi-system inflammatory syndrome
On May 4, the New York City Health Department issued a warning that 15 children in the city between the ages of 2 and 15 years had been hospitalized with multi-system inflammatory syndrome, which officials said is potentially linked to COVID-19. There have been reports of similar illnesses among children in Europe who also tested positive for COVID-19. Clinicians described the symptoms as similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease: the children all presented with fever and some with a combination of rashes, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Children are thought to have a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 and getting ill, and doctors have documented multi-system inflammatory syndrome only in rare cases.
Strokes and blood clots
Among adult patients, scientists around the world have observed a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and dangerous blood clots, even among patients who wouldn’t usually be at risk. In a recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers described five patients between the ages of 33 and 49 in New York City who were admitted to the hospital suffering severe strokes in conjunction with COVID-19. Only one had a prior history of stroke. While the likelihood of young adults suffering a stroke as a result of COVID-19 is low, results published in Thrombotic Research in April show 31 percent of COVID-19 patients in Dutch intensive care units suffered “thrombotic complications.”
“COVID toes”
A red or purple rash resembling frostbite or chilblains sometimes accompanies COVID-19 infection, particularly in younger and otherwise healthy adults. Other viral infections are known to provoke circulatory system inflammation that leads to similar skin lesions, and experts say this could be happening during COVID-19 infection.
Silent hypoxia
Although difficulty breathing is an official symptom of COVID-19, many patients show exceedingly low blood oxygen levels without the accompanying breathlessness. Scientists are investigating why COVID-19 causes this unusual form of hypoxia.
Gastrointestinal issues
Researchers in California, who published their study of 116 COVID-19 patients in the journal Gastroenterology in April, found 32 percent of people experienced mild gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that included a loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 is known to bind to ACE2 cell receptors, which are widely abundant in the GI tract and elsewhere in the body, which might explain the multifaceted nature of COVID-19 infection.
Delirium
Among seniors, a COVID-19 infection can be accompanied by disorientation and confusion. Researchers from the University of Lausanne Hospital published clinical guidelines in the Revue Medicale Suisse (translated using Google Translate) for diagnosing elderly patients with COVID-19. The common symptoms they highlight include falls and delirium in addition to fevers and GI issues. The link between infections such as urinary tract infections and delirium in older patients is well-known, though it hasn’t been rigorously investigated.

ing Liu, a computational systems biologist at the University of Pittsburgh who was studying the virus that causes COVID-19, was shot to death in his home on May 2. He was 37 years old.

Police insist Liu’s death had nothing to do with his research on SARS-CoV-2, and instead involved a personal matter. Another man, Hao Gu, was found dead in his car near Liu’s home of an apparent suicide, according to news reports.
The Computational and Systems Biology Department at Pitt, where Liu was an assistant research professor, announced in a statement its mourning of Liu’s death. “Dr. Bing Liu was an outstanding researcher, who has earned the respect and appreciation of many colleagues in the field, and made unique contributions to science,” the statement reads. 
Liu earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the National University of Singapore. He completed a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University before joining the lab of Ivet Bahar at Pitt as a research associate. He was promoted to his current position in 2016, according to his CV, and he developed machine learning approaches and other models to study biological systems. His most recent publications investigated a cell death mechanism called ferroptosis and molecules that modulate autophagy.
Bahar tells the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Liu had been studying the infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. According to the department’s statement, “Bing was on the verge of making very significant findings toward understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cellular basis of the following complications. We will make an effort to complete what he started in an effort to pay homage to his scientific excellence.”
AI Is Screening Billions of Molecules for Coronavirus Treatments/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, METAMORWORKS
A
s COVID-19 cases continue to rise, physicians have begun to repurpose existing drugs in an attempt to find something that will help patients get better. In a pilot study at the end of March, 12 adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in either Alessandria or Prato, Italy, received a daily dose of the rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, along with an anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, for two weeks. Another study group of 12 received just lopinavir and ritonavir.
After their two-week treatment, the patients who received baricitinib had mostly recovered. Their coughs and fevers were gone; they were no longer short of breath. Seven of the 12 had been discharged from the hospital. In contrast, the group who didn’t get baracitinib still had elevated temperatures, nine were coughing, and eight remained short of breath. Just one patient from the lopinavir-ritonavir–only group had been discharged.
The study comes with serious caveats: the lack of a formal control group, the small number of subjects, and the open-label design, meaning both physicians and patients knew which course of treatment they received. But it wouldn’t have been conducted at all if not for the work of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence (AI) company based in the United Kingdom. Researchers there, along with collaborator Justin Stebbing, an oncologist at Imperial College London, published a letter to The Lancet on February 4, describing how they used AI to identify baricitinib’s potential to treat COVID-19.
AI “makes higher-order correlations that a human wouldn’t be capable of making, even with all the time in the world. It links datasets that a human wouldn’t be able to link,” explains Stebbing.
Evaluating 1 billion small molecules for their ability to bind SARS-CoV-2 proteins would take a decade on even the largest of supercomputers.
The work also moved fast—crucial in a pandemic. Peter Richardson, BenevolentAI’s vice president of pharmacology, says that it took him only an afternoon of work to use the company’s knowledge graph—an enormous, digital storehouse of biomedical information and connections inferred and enhanced by machine learning—to identify two human protein targets to focus on, AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin g-associated kinase (GAK). These kinases mediate endocytosis—a process by which cells engulf things, including viruses—and, if disrupted, might make it harder for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to get into human cells. Once the researchers had those targets, they used another algorithm to find existing drugs that could hit the protein targets. The team completed the work in only a few days.
By eliminating all the drugs that are not approved by regulators, the researchers cut the list down to about 30, and sorted out the handful of those that showed the highest affinity for binding their targets. Two were toxic chemotherapy drugs, and of the remaining three, baricitinib was the clear winner. In clinical trials as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, the side effects were mostly benign and showed up after a longer period of treatment than COVID-19 patients are likely to need. Plus, it’s not metabolized by the liver and is instead excreted through the kidneys, meaning that it might be safe to combine it with a traditional antiviral—such as lopinavir—that is metabolized by the liver.
In addition to baricitinib’s predicted interactions with AAK1 and GAK, it’s a known Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. Because JAK mediates cytokine signaling that leads to inflammation, inhibiting JAK suppresses inflammation, which, at first blush, might have been a problem.
“We were in this anomalous position of having a drug that was anti-inflammatory and saying we should give this to someone who is infected by virus, which doesn’t make a lot of sense,” says Richardson. But the idea is that baricitinib not only prevents the virus from getting into cells, but also reduces the intense immune reaction that causes so many problems, even as viral titers start to fall.
It was a good enough idea that Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company that makes baricitinib, has entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study the drug’s effectiveness in COVID-19 patients in the US.
“Even if the trial doesn’t work, we’re going to find out a huge amount of who it might work in and when it might work,” says Stebbing. “It’s all about personalized medicine, which means treating the right person at the right time with the right disease with the right drugs. Hopefully, this will be a powerful part of the jigsaw.”
The BenevolentAI team is one of several groups leveraging AI to find drugs that have already been approved by regulators and could therefore be repurposed to fight SARS-CoV-2.
Shantenu Jha, a computational scientist at Rutgers University and Brookhaven National Laboratory, is coupling artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms with high-performance computing simulations to speed up the ability to screen billions of existing drugs for their interactions with and ability to disrupt SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In a pandemic, “there are many drug candidates people would like to screen and, even with the proliferation of cloud and supercomputers, there just wouldn’t be enough computing” to test them all, he says.
Evaluating 1 billion small molecules for their ability to bind SARS-CoV-2 proteins would take a decade on even the largest of supercomputers, Jha says. But he and his colleagues have integrated machine learning into the simulations they run on the supercomputers, which allows the programs to adapt to new information that gets uncovered as they run, thereby producing results—in this case, lists of candidate small molecules—much faster than traditional supercomputing methods.
Each Friday, team members share a list of top candidates with collaborators, who either use their own AI-based methods to assess the small molecules virtually or test their effectiveness against coronavirus in the lab. Whatever the results from those analyses, the researchers feed them back into the simulations to refine the search for drugs.
“With AI, the whole idea is the more accurate data you can give it, the better its ability to predict, guide, whatever you’re using it for. You can never get enough good data,” says Jha. As the researchers tweak the simulations in response to community input, they aim to increase their chances of landing on a drug candidate that could make a difference in the pandemic.
Another group, led by Albert-László Barabási, a researcher at Northeastern University, is combining AI with another strategy, network medicine—the idea that by understanding the genetic and protein interactions in the body, researchers can gain a better understanding of how things might go wrong during disease. The team has a suite of tools that connect what’s known about these interactions and how existing drugs fit into the network. Then, the researchers pinpoint the aspects of the network, or neighborhoods, that are perturbed during disease and use AI and network associations to find existing drugs that could be repurposed to offset those disruptions.
One of the things that our methods don’t tell us is whether [these drugs] would be making the situation better or worse.
— Albert-László Barabási, Northeastern University
Sometimes, drugs target the proteins directly involved in a disease, Barabási explains, but more often they hit somewhere else in the neighborhood. Over the course of three weeks, he and his colleagues searched for interactions between approved drugs that could be repurposed and the network neighborhoods of the human proteins shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. (Another group had identified these viral proteins in a March 22 bioRxiv preprint, which has now been published in Nature).
“The network medicine and AI tools have learned from what we know about the existing drugs and their network-based relationship . . . and now find similar patterns in the case of the drug and the COVID targets,” he says. “The hope is that if you find such a drug, the drug would either block the virus’s ability to do what it normally does or balance its consequences.” Perhaps the drug would interfere with a protein the virus needs to bind to as a means of infecting the cell or stop the coronavirus from using the host cell’s machinery to create its own proteins.
In an arXiv preprint submitted on April 15, the Barabási group shared a list of 81 approved drugs that the team and its collaborators are now testing in the lab to see whether or not the drugs interrupt a coronavirus infection and how they might do so. Some of the drugs—such as ritonavir, lopinavir, and chloroquine—are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials, while others, such as the antihistamine azelastine, are not.
“One of the things that our methods don’t tell us is whether [these drugs] would be making the situation better or worse,” says Barabási. Their strategy just indicates whether a drug perturbs the right neighborhood, not how it will affect the network once it does. “That’s why we prefer to start with the lab-based experiments before clinical trials because in the lab we will be able to see if the impact goes in the right direction.”
Bartosz Gryzbowski, a chemist at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, and his group have used a small portion of their AI platform that is usually dedicated to novel drug development to analyze drugs and their interactions at the molecular level. In a ChemRxiv preprint posted April 17, the researchers used AI algorithms to identify progeny drugs that bear similarities to the drugs already being tested for COVID-19, which they termed parents.
The platform evaluates a parent drug’s three-dimensional structure, the specifics of its structure that lead to chemical interactions, and the context of how the overall structure and these specific domains interact with a potential target and with other domains within the molecule. Then, it can identify progeny drugs that have the potential to interact at a molecular level in a similar way. In the case where a parent drug proves to be ineffective in laboratory or clinical trials, having the progeny drugs already identified could point the way for clinicians who want to try alternatives quickly.
“It might be an act of desperation to go for drug repurposing, but also for this pandemic and for the next pandemic . . . there must be some fundamental shift in how we discover or how we at least get hints about drugs because every time some virus happens, we’ll be completely unprepared,” Gryzbowski says.

esearchers have generated a full-length clone of the novel coronavirus genome using artificial chromosomes in brewers’ yeast, according to a paper published in Nature on Monday (May 4). While other laboratories are constructing, or have constructed, clones of SARS-CoV-2 by alternative methods, a major benefit of the yeast system is its speed and stability, researchers say.
“The exciting thing about the yeast is that . . . it’s fast,” says microbiologist and coronavirus expert Susan Weiss of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not a member of the research team. “The other methods are tedious and difficult.”
Reconstructing and modifying the genomes of disease-causing viruses is the starting point of many research endeavors in virology. These genetic manipulations are essential for studying a virus’s method of infection, its replication, drugs that might work against it, and potential vaccines.
During outbreaks and pandemics of novel viruses, “speed is of the essence” for cloning, says virologist Darwyn Kobasa of the University of Manitoba who was not involved in the research, especially if new variants emerge. He adds that the speed of this new technique is “really quite impressive.”
“The idea is to learn about the virus” and its weaknesses, says coauthor Volker Thiel of the University of Bern. Like scientists all around the world performing such studies, Thiel and his team work in a high-containment facility with strict biosecurity and safety protocols designed to protect the researchers and prevent accidental release of any viruses.
Possibly the most widely used method for cloning viral genomes is to stitch fragments of the DNA together and introduce them into Escherichia coli bacteria for replication. But for some viruses, including coronaviruses, the approach can be problematic. “First of all, [coronaviruses] have extraordinarily large genomes,” says Thiel, making them difficult for the bacteria to cope with, and also, parts of the genome are unstable or can be toxic to the bacteria for reasons that are not entirely clear.
Because yeast cells are larger than bacteria, they can handle bigger pieces of DNA. And there’s another big advantage, says coauthor Joerg Jores, also of the University of Bern. Yeast cells have an inherent ability to assemble fragments of DNA into one big molecule.
What this means is that instead of having to reconstruct the viral DNA first before introducing it into cells, you instead “put all these fragments in the yeast and it magically puts them together,” says Weiss.
This automatic fragment assembly is at the heart of the previously described cloning method used by the team—called transformation associated recombination (TAR). To reconstruct SARS-CoV-2, Thiel, Jores, and colleagues generated 14 fragments of DNA representing the entire virus genome (some amplified from viral RNA, others synthesized). Each fragment shared a short region of overlapping sequence with the next so the yeast cell could identify which ends matched up. The two end fragments of the genome also shared overlapping sequences with a plasmid vector that would contain the viral genome and allow it to form a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). The gluing process is called homologous recombination and involves trimming away nucleotides at the end of one strand of DNA and annealing the remaining complimentary sequences (the overlapping section) to another fragment.
“The capacity to recombine things to a YAC by themselves is just amazing,” says Jores.
His team introduced the fragments into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and picked and tested colonies for the presence of the full-length genome two days later. In vitro transcription of the DNA extracted from such clones then produced RNA, which they used to infect cultured mammalian cells. From introducing the DNA into yeast to recovering infectious RNA virus took just a week. The team has also cloned a version of SARS-CoV-2 encoding a fluorescent reporter for high-throughput drug screens, they say.
A recent paper in Cell Host & Microbe reported the construction of a full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome via a process called in vitro ligation. This method is also “pretty fast,” says Thiel, “but it still has the issue of using E. coli” to clone the individual fragments before ligation. Plus, with the yeast system, he says, “we have a stably cloned [YAC] that we can always reuse, so we don’t have to reassemble by in vitro ligation” each time infectious virus particles are needed.
As well as speeding up the cloning process, the technique “solves some of the problems that are inherent with doing cloning in E. coli,” says Kobasa, such as the instability or toxicity of certain DNA fragments.
Indeed, coronavirus researcher Luis Enjuanes of the National Center of Biotechnology in Madrid who is currently cloning SARS-CoV-2 using the bacterial system, says one fragment of the genome is causing “a little toxicity.” He is confident that his team can work around the problem, and adds that, while he is impressed by the speed of the yeast technology, an advantage of the bacterial system is that “anyone can do it.” Genetic manipulations in E. coli is standard in most molecular biology laboratories around the world, while using yeast in this way is less prevalent.
The authors used the TAR technique to clone a variety of other viruses including MERS and Zika, but say the focus of their work at the moment is, not surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2. “We’re working 24-7,” says Thiel. “We’re trying to save the world,” Jores adds with a laugh.

UK Launches Trial of Contact Tracing App on Isle of Wight/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JON RITCHIE
O
n the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England, local government staff and healthcare workers can now download a smartphone app from the UK’s National Health Service that will register contacts between users, the BBC reports. On Thursday (May 7), the rest of the island’s more than 140,000 residents will be encouraged to get the app as well.
The app is part the UK’s plan to “test, track, and trace” individuals while easing social distancing measures under the continued threat of COVID-19. It could be available to the wider UK population within weeks, according to CNBC.
“Please download the app to protect the NHS and save lives,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged Isle of Wight residents, according to the BBC. “By downloading the app, you’re protecting your own health, you’re protecting the health of your loved ones, and the health of the community.”
The National Health Service (NHS) app identifies when a user comes within about two meters of another user for at least 15 minutes. Users can report when they become sick with COVID-19—based on test results or on self-diagnosis—which can trigger alerts to other users they’ve been in contact with as well as to more-distant contacts.
Participation is voluntary and the only personal information required is the user’s postcode. People will be able to opt-in to allow location data to be recorded. The NHS’s plan is to process the data on computers in the UK rather than on users’ phones—a practice that tech companies such as Apple and Google, as well as privacy advocates, say weakens data security and provides a means for the government to monitor peoples’ social circles. This is in contrast to a so-called decentralized approach that does not pool the data in one location.
The decentralized model has been adopted by Apple and Google, which have developed their own contact-tracing technology, and apps that use their technology have a huge advantage, The Verge reports. That’s because both tech giants typically restrict when Bluetooth signals are broadcast from a phone but have the ability to adjust those settings.
For example, signals are normally only transmitted when the phone is awake and the app is running in the foreground. If this is the case with a contact-tracing app, it could often miss important interactions. But because “Google and Apple can rewrite these rules for their own contact-tracing API [application programming interface] because they control the operating systems,” The Verge explains, apps relying on their technology can avoid overlooking such contacts.
Although the NHS tells the BBC that its app will work without having to be active, questions remain about whether it will successfully capture many of the relevant contacts that could spread COVID-19.
Why the Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Tests Varies So Much/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HUMONIA
D
ue to increasing demand from both researchers and policymakers, the number of antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has skyrocketed in recent weeks. According to a list kept by the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), more than 200 of these products, which are also known as serologic tests, are either now available or in development. Many of the test manufacturers are based in China, but there are also companies in a number of other countries, including South Korea, Germany, the US, and the UK.
Only 12 have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which gives companies permission to deploy a product without providing the same amount of supportive evidence as required in the typical approval process. In March, the FDA announced that, to expedite availability, companies could market these tests in the US without EUA as long as they conducted their own evaluation. Yesterday (May 4), the agency announced it would heighten the scrutiny of these tests after being criticized for the deluge of flawed tests that have become available in the US.
The trend that we’re starting to see [with rapid tests] is that there is inconsistency in many of [the manufacturers’] claims.
—Rangarajan Sampath, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics
“At this point we have more commercially available serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 than any other infectious disease,” says Elitza Theel, the director of the Mayo Clinic’s Infectious Disease Serology Laboratory. “It is crazy.”
As researchers and policymakers around the world rush to put these tests to use, concerns have been raised about their precision. For example, when a widely publicized study on the rate of infection in the California county of Santa Clara raised alarms, a key criticism was the inaccuracy of the antibody test used by the group. In other cases, tests have turned out to be too inaccurate for use at all—for example, last month, the British government shelved a rapid antibody test it had paid $20 million for because it turned out to be inadequate.
Several groups are now conducting independent assessments of these antibody tests. Their work suggests that there is wide variability in performance, and that the accuracy of a test can depend not only on the test itself, but factors such as when it is conducted and how a user interprets the result.
See “How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2”
How antibodies test work
There are two broad categories of antibody assays: lab-based tests and rapid tests. One of the most common techniques used in lab-based tests is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), where a sample—blood, serum, or plasma—is placed on a plate coated with a viral protein. If a person has antibodies against the virus, they will bind the protein. To identify these viral protein–antibody complexes, scientists introduce a molecule that will fluoresce in the presence of the bound molecules. These tests can provide a quantitative measure of the antibodies present in a sample.
Rapid tests instead use a lateral flow assay (LFA) format. The underlying principle of an LFA is similar to an ELISA, but these are carried on a device that resembles a pregnancy test. They typically require a small amount of blood gathered from a finger prick. The blood flows through a strip that has viral proteins on its surface, and if antibodies are present in the blood, they attach to those proteins. The resulting complexes will then bind to molecules immobilized on the strip, and if a threshold—which varies by manufacturer—is reached, the test will display one or two colored lines that indicate a positive result. Unlike ELISAs, these tests only generate a binary “yes” or “no” result.
Lab-based tests usually take a few hours to generate a result, while rapid tests can be completed in 30 minutes or less.
A test’s performance depends on two measures: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitive tests generate few false negatives and specific tests lead to few false positives. How accurate a test needs to be depends on what it is being used for, says Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of FIND. For seroprevalence studies, which seek to identify the proportion of a population who have been infected with the virus, for example, he says that more than 98 percent specificity and more than 90 percent sensitivity are desired.
One of the antibody tests most recently approved for EUA by the FDA, a lab-based assay by Roche, boasts 100 percent sensitivity and 99.8 percent specificity.
Accuracy assessments
Several groups are now independently evaluating antibody tests for these measures. One study, dubbed the COVID-19 Testing Project and run by physicians and researchers at institutions including the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, evaluated 10 LFAs and two ELISAs. To assess their ability to identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the team used plasma or serum samples from three groups: 80 people who had shown symptoms of COVID-19 and had tested positive using a PCR-based screen, 52 who had a respiratory infection but were found to be infected with another virus or had tested negative on a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, and 108 blood donors whose samples were drawn in 2018 or earlier, before the pandemic began.
Their assessment found that the ability to detect antibodies in people who had tested positive for the virus increased over time, rising to 81–100 percent when more than 20 days had elapsed since symptoms began, depending on the product. One of the members of the team, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at UCB, notes that this finding highlights why longitudinal antibody testing is important, given that a negative result may mean a person had been exposed to the virus but hadn’t yet developed a detectable level of antibodies. On the specificity side, the proportion of false positives found in the pre–COVID-19 samples ranged from 0–16 percent. The agreement between the findings of LFAs and ELISAs ranged from 75–94 percent. The team posted its results as a preprint on the project website on April 24. Alex Marson, an immunologist at UCSF and a coauthor of the report, cautions that some numbers, especially for tests’ ability to detect antibodies in positive cases, may be revised as his team continues to analyze the data.
It’s so important that we don’t just take these tests off the shelf and start using them.
—Elitza Theel, Mayo Clinic
“Some tests I would not consider adequate to be used for serology testing, whereas others were quite good,” Hsu says. A single rapid test, by the Chinese company Bioperfectus, detected antibodies in 100 percent of the PCR-positive samples—but only after more than 20 days from symptom onset. It did not demonstrate 100 percent specificity, however. For that measure, only one rapid test—an assay developed by the US- and Hong Kong–based company Sure Biotech—did not give any false positives. 
According to the The New York Times, one of the tests examined in the study, by the Chinese company Innovita, has been ordered by Los Angeles–based start-up Scanwell Health, which hopes to market the product for at-home use, pending FDA authorization. That test identified antibodies in up to 83 percent of people with confirmed infections and has a specificity of 96 percent.
Another one of the tests included in the study, which is sold by the US-based Premier Biotech and manufactured by the Chinese company Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, was used in the controversial Santa Clara seroprevalence survey. In the medRxiv preprint about that study, the authors cited a specificity of 99.5 percent and sensitivity of 82 percent. Hsu and his colleagues found that the test’s specificity was 97 percent—and it identified antibodies in 37 percent of samples from one to five days after symptom onset and in 90 percent 20 days later (the Santa Clara study did not look solely at symptomatic individuals, and Hsu’s study did not examine samples from people with asymptomatic infections.)
A few similar assessments have been published in recent weeks. One of the most recent studies, conducted by a group at the University of Washington, found that a lab-based antibody test developed by the US company Abbott had a sensitivity reaching 100 percent 17 days after symptom onset and only registered one false positive in 1,020 samples collected prior to the pandemic. “These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance,” the authors write in a preprint posted on medRxiv on May 2.
Other studies have reported less promising numbers. One conducted by the National COVID Testing Scientific Advisory Panel in the UK examined nine LFA devices and found that at 10 days after symptom onset or later, sensitivity ranged from 61–88 percent in samples that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using a PCR test. Specificity, as determined by whether the test would pick up false positives in pre-pandemic samples, ranged from 95–100 percent. “Our findings suggest that while current [LFA] devices may provide some information for population-level surveys, their performance is inadequate for most individual patient applications,” write the authors in their preprint, which was posted on medRxiv in April.
Overall, “the trend that we’re starting to see [with rapid tests] is that there is inconsistency in many of [the manufacturers’] claims” about performance, Sampath says.
Lab-based tests vary as well. Theel notes that her team has found variability in the accuracy of several ELISA-based tests for COVID-19. And a study conducted by a group in Denmark, which was posted as a preprint on medRxiv last month, also reported variability in commercially available ELISAs.
The assessments to date “underscore why it’s so important that we don’t just take these tests off the shelf and start using them,” Theel says. “We have to verify the performance characteristics, otherwise you’re going to be calling many people falsely positive and others potentially falsely negative.”
More evaluations are currently underway. FIND is carrying out its own studies of serology tests at sites around the world including in the US, Europe, South America, and Africa. The FDA is collaborating with other governmental institutions to assess these tests—and may use these data to inform whether or not to issue future EUAs. And according to Hsu, several test manufacturers have reached out to him and his collaborators since their preprint was posted asking for their products to be tested as well—and the members of the COVID-19 Testing Project plan to conduct more of these assessments.
What makes a test accurate?
There are a number of variables that play into the accuracy of a test. As the evaluations to date have shown, antibody tests become more sensitive at later time points. How a test result is interpreted is also important. According to Alex Marson, a member of the COVID-19 Testing Project and an immunologist at UCSF, there was a point during their recent study when his group in California and their collaborators at MGH were interpreting a faint band differently—one considered it a positive result, while the other did not. Many of these tests don’t give clear guidance on how to interpret a result like that, Marson says. “If these tests are going to be deployed, whoever is going to be interpreting them needs to get really strict instructions on what’s going to be a positive and negative.”
Features of the test itself, such as the antibody it is designed to detect, can also affect accuracy. The two antibodies used in most available antibody tests are IgM and IgG. When a SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs, IgM appears to be the first responder, arriving on the scene within a week or so of infection. A second antibody, IgG, generates a more specific and longer-lasting response—but it shows up later, when the viral RNA signal may have already faded away.
“You’re looking for IgM so that you’re not missing a period in between when the RNA might be variable, and in some cases, undetectable,” Sampath explains. The downside is that, based on the assessments conducted so far, IgM signals seem to be less robust than IgG. Many tests combine the two. All the tests examined in Tsu and Marson’s study were capable of identifying both, and the team’s assessments showed that IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and that detection rates were highest when both were combined.
Another variable is the viral protein, also known as an antigen, that’s used to bind the antibodies. The two that have been most widely used in antibody tests to date are the nucleocapsid protein, which forms the shell around the viral RNA, and the spike protein, which studs the surface of the virus and binds to host cells. According to Sampath, because the nucleocapsid proteins tend to be more conserved across different viruses, tests that use them may be less specific than those that use the spike protein. For this reason, he adds, spike proteins have become the preferred reagent in newer versions of these tests.
In addition to those variables, how the viral proteins are produced—what type of cell line is used, for example—can also affect the performance of an assay. “It’s not just which antigen but in how is that antigen produced,” Theel says.
At the end of the day, there’s also a huge caveat to consider, says Kamran Kadkhoda, an immunologist at the Cleveland Clinic. “The elephant in the room,” he says, is the lack of robust science behind the usefulness of this test for clinical or public health purposes, given that there are still big open questions, such as what the presence of antibodies actually means about immunity and how long antibodies remain after an infection has passed.
The bottom line is that more independent evaluations are needed to determine how good these tests are—and more research is necessary to understand what their results can tell us. “For serology, I really think the best is yet to come,” Theel says. “Once we identify whether or not, or for how long, protective immunity lasts and how these antibody tests are related to such immunity, I think that’s when they’ll really be important.”

Doctors Date First COVID-19 Case in France to Late December/-/ABOVE: One of the hospitals where Yves Cohen works.
WIKIMEDIA, SUAUDEAU
A
man living in France may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as early as December 27, weeks before the first official coronavirus cases were reported in the country, according to a study published online Sunday (May 3) in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.
When the man, Amirouche Hammar, a 42-year-old fishmonger, visited a hospital north of Paris on December 27, he suffered from chest pains and had difficulty breathing. Doctors diagnosed him with viral pneumonia and treated him with antibiotics. “We told ourselves, ‘It’s a virus that we haven’t discovered,’ but we stopped there,” Yves Cohen, one of Hammar’s doctors who works at Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals, told BFM-TV, according to the Associated Press.
As cases of COVID-19 spread worldwide, Cohen and his colleagues decided to analyze samples taken from patients visiting the hospital who were diagnosed with influenza-like illness between December 2, 2019, and January 16, 2020. Of the 14 samples described in the study, only one, Hammar’s, was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Cohen and his team called Hammar after they got this result and learned he had not traveled before getting sick and that one of his children had fallen ill with similar symptoms around the same time. Both Hammar’s children ended up becoming sick while his wife showed no symptoms of illness. Hammar’s wife worked in a local market selling fish. She may have been an asymptomatic carrier, contracting the virus at the market, Cohen tells BF-MTV.
Cohen and his colleagues caution that the work is tentative. The study was done retrospectively, “medical records were not exhaustive and some relevant information might have been missing,” Cohen tells the AP.
The sample could also have been contaminated in the lab in which it was stored and tested, Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, tells the AP. “If he was infected (with COVID-19), then you would expect a more rapid and earlier spread of the virus in France than was seen,” he says in a statement.
Other experts say it’s possible the virus was spreading weeks before the first cases were confirmed in France on January 24, 2020.
“This gives a whole new picture on everything,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva, according to Reuters. “The findings help to better understand the potential virus circulation of COVID-19,” he explained, and urged doctors in countries around the world to test unspecified cases of pneumonia for SARS-CoV-2.
An Old TB Vaccine Finds New Life in Coronavirus Trials/-/ABOVE: MODIFIED FROM © ISTOCK.COM, VISUAL GENERATION, FAIRYWONG, WENMEI ZHOU; © TASHA DIBIAGIO
O
ne of the oldest vaccines could protect us against our newest infectious disease, COVID-19. The vaccine has been given to babies to protect them against tuberculosis for almost a century, but has been shown to shield them from other infections too, prompting scientists to investigate whether it can protect against the coronavirus.
This Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, named after two French microbiologists, consists of a live weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis, a cousin of M. tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. BCG has been given to more than 4 billion individuals, making it the most widely administered vaccine globally.
Because BCG protects babies against some viral infections in addition to TB, researchers decided to compare data from countries with and without mandatory BCG vaccination to see if immunization policies are linked to the number or severity of COVID-19 infections. A handful of preprint publications in the last two months noted that countries with an ongoing BCG vaccination program are experiencing lower death rates from COVID-19 than those without.
These non-specific effects [from BCG] are strongest when we look at respiratory infection outcomes.
—Christine Stabell Benn, University of Southern Denmark
One study, for instance, found that mandatory BCG was associated with a significantly slower climb in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of an outbreak. Another modeled mortality in two dozen countries and reported that those without universal BCG vaccination, such as Italy, the US, and the Netherlands, were more severely affected by the pandemic than those with universal vaccination. 
A downside with the preprints is that they show a statistical correlation, not cause and effect. “There are many sources of bias inherent in these cross-country comparisons,” warns Zoë McLaren, a professor of public health at the University of Maryland. For example, she says, the types of countries implementing the BCG vaccine may be more likely to also take proactive measures to protect their people against COVID-19, such as “shelter in place” orders. McLaren says she can think of almost 20 sources of bias in these studies. In another example, those who get a BCG vaccine may be more likely to have had a better start in life, putting them on a healthier trajectory. The studies cannot account for all confounding factors.
Epidemiologist Christine Stabell Benn of the University of Southern Denmark has studied BCG vaccine for the last two decades and reported that it reduces overall childhood mortality from infectious diseases. She warns against reading too much into the preprint papers. “This is the weakest kind of evidence that we have in our evidence pyramid,” she says. “It just links prevalence of one thing with the prevalence of another.” 
But rather than toss out the idea of BCG’s link to fewer COVID cases or deaths, she says there’s good reason to consider it seriously. She has more direct evidence that BCG vaccination can ready our immune system for viral infections. And a number of clinical trials have now begun to investigate whether a BCG shot given to those most at risk of contracting the infection can protect them from the disease.
Evidence that BCG protects against other infections
Benn’s work is among accumulating evidence, as detailed in a recent review paper, that childhood BCG vaccination protects against other diseases, so-called off target effects. Much of the evidence to support the new clinical studies is based on trials by her group and on work by Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, who came up with a mechanistic explanation as to why BCG—designed to thwart a bacterial infection—could boost immune responses to viruses.
A study in 2000 led by Benn’s spouse and long-time collaborator Peter Aaby at the Bandim Health Project reported a significant reduction in mortality that was far greater than could be explained by preventing tuberculosis in infants who received BCG in Guinea-Bissau. And a 2005 study found a reduction in lower respiratory tract infections in BCG-vaccinated infants in the same country. In later studies, including one published in 2017, Benn and Aaby randomized thousands of low–birth weight children in this west African country to receive BCG right at birth or to be vaccinated at six weeks of age, which is the usual practice there. “There was a one-third reduction in neonatal mortality in those receiving BCG [earlier]” Benn says. The benefits mostly came from reduced rates of respiratory disease and septicemia in the babies, she adds.  
In Guinea-Bissau, the researchers also compared children who developed a scar after vaccination with those who received the vaccine but did not develop a scar. The scar signals an appropriate immune response to the vaccine. In 2003, Aaby and colleagues reported significantly lower mortality in children with a vaccine scar. In a subsequent meta-analysis of similar studies, they suggested that the effect of revaccinating scar-negative children should be considered.
“We saw more than 40 percent reduction in overall mortality among those who had a scar, versus those who didn’t have a scar,” says Benn.
Benn says she is hopeful that BCG might offer some benefits against severe COVID-19. She gave herself a booster shot a few weeks back. “These non-specific effects [from BCG] are strongest when we look at respiratory infection outcomes,” says Benn.

A possible mechanism
When Benn and Aaby reported that BCG reduces infectious disease rates more than a decade ago, this was dismissed as biologically implausible at the time, she recalls. Vaccines induce long-lived memory B cells, which tweak their own genes to tailor-make antibodies against a specific microbe. These B cells are then kept in reserve in bone marrow. They quickly proliferate if the host again encounters the pathogen, giving long-lived immunity. B cells do not explain why a vaccine would allow someone to respond better to an unrelated microbe. 
Netea proposed in 2012 that BCG works by putting the “innate” arm of the immune system, such as macrophages, on a higher alert status, a phenomenon termed “trained immunity.” The task of macrophages is to identify, engulf, and destroy foreign entities. They can also signal for reinforcements using cytokines. It was assumed that these guards did not remember particular pathogens, but stand as a blunt frontline defense. Twenty years ago, this innate system was viewed by most as crude and non-specific, says immunologist Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin. “Then there was a Copernican revolution in immunology. Suddenly, it was realized how important the innate side was.” 
See “Thanks for the Memories”
Nobel prizes went in 2011 to scientists who discovered innate receptors as gatekeepers of the immune system. Their research had kindled greater research interest in innate immune cells. Netea subsequently proposed that BCG primes frontline immune cells through epigenetic changes and metabolic rewiring. This is what allows them not to be placed on higher alert. 
Priming the innate immune system matters for vaccines and for future infections. “If you vaccinate first with BCG and then give an influenza vaccine, the influenza vaccine works better,” says Netea. He reported this in 2015 in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of a vaccine against the 2009 pandemic strain. The experiment involved 40 men. Benn will this autumn test whether BCG administration 14 days prior to a seasonal flu vaccine could elicit a better response in those over 65.  
To get a sense of how BCG might protect against a future pathogen, Netea infected healthy human volunteers with attenuated yellow fever virus in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects who had been BCG vaccinated one month prior to the exposure showed significantly lower amounts of circulating yellow fever virus than those injected with placebo instead. The study, published last year, concluded that BCG induced epigenetic reprogramming of human monocytes and led to a more robust response against yellow fever virus.
After BCG administration, “there is more production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. They recruit immune cells easier to the site of infection, and those cells are better at killing and eliminating the virus,” says Netea.  
According to Netea’s hypothesis, BCG could prep macrophages in a way that results in a locally stronger cytokine response directed against SARS-CoV-2, focused at the site of infection. “This would prevent inefficient systemic response later, which can harm the patient,” he explains, the so-called cytokine storm. Macrophages call to arms B and T cells, which would mean that those primed with BCG should be more efficient at killing off a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Innate immune priming after BCG is probably optimal for two or three years, says Netea, an estimate based on epidemiological data in children. In his view, “the fact that somebody has been vaccinated 50 or 60 years ago is probably non-protective.” This runs counter to the links in epidemiological data suggesting that BCG is now assisting adults in responding to COVID-19. McLaren says even the vaccine’s protection against TB probably lasts just two decades. O’Neill too is skeptical about innate priming lasting this long. He says he wonders if countries with high childhood BCG vaccination rates, such as Japan, may protect elderly people indirectly from COVID-19, because vaccinated kids don’t spread it as much to them. 
Benn says she thinks innate memory may yet surprise us. “We know for sure that the [BCG] effect lasts for at least one year in children. We also have indications it can last much longer,” she says, “in principle up to forty years.” One Danish study by Aaby and Benn indicated that people who had received smallpox and/or BCG vaccine at school entry had a more than 40 percent reduced risk of dying up to the age of 45. “This was seen in infectious disease, but also cardiovascular disease and neurological disease,” Benn explains. 
BCG clinical trials begin
Netea, who collaborates with Benn, is wary about suggesting that a BCG shot from decades ago protects against COVID-19 but remains open-minded about the efficacy of more recent BCG shots. “We need randomized clinical trials to be able to draw conclusions,” he says. Trials are kicking off in the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, and the US, says Netea, mostly to test BCG in medical staff.
This vaccine protects babies against TB. If we start using it for something unproven, there is a danger a price will be paid by young children.

In an Australian trial among 4,000 healthcare workers, “we will measure whether those who get the vaccine get less COVID-19, and if they do get it, if they are unwell for less time or have less severe symptoms,” says Nigel Curtis, a clinician and researcher at the Murdock Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne.  
In the Netherlands, Netea is recruiting 1,500 volunteer healthcare providers, half of whom will be randomly selected to receive BCG. He is also starting a trial soon on 1,600 volunteers over the age of 60, half of whom will receive a placebo injection, the other half BCG. Netea advocates BCG as a possible preventive measure only for at-risk groups to avoid shortages. “It could be a bridge to a vaccine,” says O’Neill, who notes that tuberculosis bacteria live in the lungs, so BCG could perhaps boost immunity there. “I am waiting for the trials of course.”
Benn is planning a trial in Denmark to look at 1,500 healthcare workers randomized to receive BCG or placebo and then followed for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Denmark used BCG up until the 1980s, so there will be a subgroup among the newly vaccinated who received BCG once before, at school. Benn hypothesizes that BCG benefits will be more pronounced amongst this subset of healthcare workers than those who did not get a BCG jab as children. 
A risk for BCG shortages
In the absence of clinical trial data, the World Health Organization does not recommend BCG for the prevention of COVID-19. There is concern that people might jump the gun and decide BCG is effective before the trial results come out. McLaren says she worries that the rash of preprint comparison studies could inflict harm. “If people interpret these correlation studies as high-quality evidence or jump on the bandwagon of BCG, then we might invest in polices that are ineffective and take resources away from infants and children who need BCG vaccines,” she says.
Curtis too is concerned. He says he has heard about vaccine supplies in parts of Africa meant for children being diverted to healthcare workers. “That is a tragedy,” says Curtis. “This vaccine protects babies against TB. If we start using it for something unproven, there is a danger a price will be paid by young children.” 
Students Stand Up for Sub-Contracted Workers Amid COVID-19 Crisis/-/ABOVE: The Rockefeller University
WIKIMEDIA, AJAY SURESH
O
n March 15, as the novel coronavirus swept through New York City, biophysics PhD student Donovan Phua and the rest of the Rockefeller University community learned that the research institution would be shutting down in three days. Only essential labs would remain open, including those that had quickly pivoted their research to COVID-19. 
There was no word of changes to Phua’s graduate student salary. Along with faculty members and postdocs, he was instructed to begin working remotely once the university closed, he says. As far as he could tell, staff salaries would remain the same.
The next night, Phua was working in his lab and talked with two custodial employees about the impending shutdown, he tells The Scientist. He asked what was happening with their jobs. According to Phua, the employees, who work for a company contracted by Rockefeller, told him that their last day was to be March 18 and that they would no longer receive pay.
More than 700 faculty members at Stanford University signed a letter in which they agreed to donate a portion of their wages toward supporting sub-contracted workers.
That conversation prompted Phua and his peers to start a campaign in support of these furloughed workers. Students at a number of universities have been advocating for the payment of employees, and especially contracted workers who are more vulnerable to layoffs, as campuses shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Phua raised the issue with the Rockefeller Inclusive Science Initiative (RiSi), a student-run organization supporting minorities in science and economically disadvantaged groups. Together, the members decided to investigate which campus staff were potentially affected by the university’s looming shutdown, Phua says. They talked to security guards, stockroom workers, housing employees, and animal caretakers, all of whom Phua says were direct hires of the university who would continue to receive payment. A sub-contracted food service employee also said she had been notified the night before the shutdown that she would be paid, according to Phua, even though she would no longer be working. Custodial workers, he says, were the only employees they identified who were set to be furloughed (The Scientist could not confirm this with Rockefeller, as the university did not respond to requests for comment).
The cleaning staff are “definitely a group we’re indebted to for maintaining and helping us do our jobs day to day,” says César Vargas, a PhD student in neuroecology and co-president of RiSi. “It was really kind of sad to hear that they might not get the same treatment that other groups on campus were getting.” While Vargas says he understands the logic, the university’s apparent decision not to pay custodial workers wasn’t “the trusting response you would want initially.”
Phua reached out to Alex Kogan, the associate vice president of plant operations and housing at Rockefeller, on March 18, and asked whether everyone who worked at the university—including contracted employees—would be getting paid while the campus was closed. At the same time, Phua says, RiSi members began to draft a petition to pay service workers during the shutdown. Within 24 hours, according to Vargas, they had collected several hundred signatures, including those from two heads of labs.
Emails reviewed by The Scientist show that a day after Phua’s first message to Kogan, the university confirmed that the sub-contracted custodial staff would receive payment for a period of four weeks.
“Relieved is an understatement,” says Tony Rexach, a custodial worker who has worked at Rockefeller for three years, recalling what it felt like to learn he would still receive his paycheck. “I was ecstatic.” Rexach tells The Scientist that before he heard the news, he had been thinking, “How am I going to do this? How can I go through this and survive this? And it’s not like you can just not get paid and look for another job,” he says, “because everybody is going through this. The city is shut down, just about.” 
Similar campaigns have found success on other university campuses as sub-contracted workers face uncertainties regarding their employment status. At Duke University, for instance, the Duke Graduate Students Union teamed up with local labor unions to push for financial protection for sub-contracted workers after the university confirmed that faculty and staff would be paid during the shutdown, according to The Chronicle. Duke later announced that the university would pay furlough wages until May 31 for all full-time contract workers who were scheduled for at least 30 hours per week before the campus closed, according to a second article in the outlet.
After organizing efforts at Harvard University yielded a petition that gathered more than 7,000 signatures, the university agreed to pay contracted service and trade workers whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, or who don’t currently have work they are able to perform on campus, through May 28, according to a university statement. And students at the University of Virginia campaigned for an emergency fund for furloughed employees that exceeds $3 million, reports The Daily Progress.
See “How Scientists Can Volunteer to Help Fight COVID-19”
At Rockefeller, Phua and his peers later learned that as the ongoing pandemic forced the university to stay shuttered longer than initially anticipated, the fate of contract workers changed.
Angie Arroyo, a food service worker at Rockefeller, says she was thrilled upon learning the night before the shutdown that sub-contracted employees in her department would be compensated. “That was something great to hear,” she says. “We were really grateful that they lent their hand to us and wanted to pay us for this time off.”
However, layoffs eventually took place at Rockefeller. Arroyo confirms to The Scientist that after a month of being paid, she is currently laid off and has filed for unemployment. Emails seen by The Scientist state that the health insurance of Rockefeller’s sub-contracted food service employees has been paid for through July 31. Arroyo says she’s using her rainy day savings and hopes to be back working at the university by May 15.
Incomplete success
Other grassroots efforts to protect contract workers have achieved limited success. Students at Stanford University have gone to great lengths in advocating for the payment of furloughed employees. “Around March 7, things started to snowball,” says Adam Nayak, a sophomore studying civil and environmental engineering. Nayak is a core group member of Students for Workers’ Rights (SWR) at Stanford, and reports that shortly after the university announced on March 10 that classes during the spring term would be conducted online and that students living in campus housing should leave if they were able to do so, SWR was informed that 55 sub-contracted kitchen staff members would be laid off. 
The student group mobilized, drafting a petition that asked for fair pay, protection, and information for campus service workers during the pandemic. They then raised more than $100,000 for the workers, who Nayak says were “receiving two weeks of pay continuance and then nothing.” (The Scientist’s attempts to reach Stanford for confirmation were unanswered.) The funds are currently in the process of being distributed, according to Nayak. Nine days later, the university agreed to interim pay continuation for regular employees in a statement that did not address sub-contracted workers.
It was really kind of sad to hear that they might not get the same treatment that other groups on campus were getting.
—César Vargas, Rockefeller Inclusive Science Initiative
Shortly thereafter, Nayak and other SWR members learned that roughly 70 employees of UG-2, a contractor that supplies janitorial and grounds workers on the Stanford campus, had been laid off as of the last week of March with no pay continuance, according to Nayak and as reported by The Stanford Daily. That number was projected to increase to more than 130 employees by April 30, The Stanford Daily reports. 
SWR then released an Action Network petition asking for pay continuance, hazard pay, two additional weeks of paid sick leave, personal protective equipment, and regular COVID-19 information updates for sub-contracted workers. The petition has now received more than 5,500 signatures. The group also started a new fundraiser for emergency relief for all workers, which has raised close to $100,000, according to Nayak. Members have also emailed and called administrators, coordinated social media campaigns, and received official approval from the Associated Students of Stanford University undergraduate senate in support of their mission. Additionally, Nayak reports, more than 700 faculty members signed a letter in which they agreed to donate a portion of their wages toward supporting sub-contracted workers.
After initially citing financial challenges, Stanford recently announced that it would offer resources alongside those provided by the federal government to maintain income and benefits for sub-contracted employees through June 15. Stanford did not respond to The Scientist’s request for clarification on its current policy, which has caused concern among SRW members that it may not fully cover all workers’ pre-shutdown income and benefits.
This most recent statement, Nayak says, doesn’t specify how the university intends to support workers. “It’s not to say that we don’t have any optimism that the institution will do the right thing or can do the right thing, or that we don’t believe them when they say that they’re going to support workers,” Nayak explains. “It’s just that we don’t know the details.”
Ethan Chua, an anthropology major in his senior year at Stanford who is also a member of SRW, says he has “been very disillusioned over the last month” by the university’s response. He found out on April 22 from the labor union representing the custodial staff that Stanford was only paying the sub-contractors’ benefits, but not their wages. The fight continued on April 23, when the SRW held a Zoom press conference featuring California state senate candidate Jackie Fielder; Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs; statements from former presidential hopeful Julian Castro and Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-TX); and a number of laid off service workers who shared their statements and stories.
For Nayak, the work of sub-contracted employees is an integral part of his education at Stanford. “Faculty in every department have relationships with their custodial and janitorial staff who they see every single day,” Nayak says. “And without our service workers, Stanford as an institution could not operate, and that includes research practices, that includes classes, that includes having office hours in the buildings—literally all of these services are being provided to students so the educational goals and values can persist.”
Memory in a Time of Quarantine/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SWISSMEDIAVISION
T
he past couple of months have been heavy for us at The Scientist. Heavy for everyone. From our home offices, we’ve been tirelessly reporting on the global pandemic that continues to grip the world in its stranglehold. We are trying to stay atop a flood of information and stories that need telling as we also contend with challenges that most of us have never confronted, and none of us will likely soon forget. At the same time, we continue to search across the life sciences for other nuggets of research worth sharing. This month, our issue is focused on the science of memory.
Our memories make us who we are, subconsciously driving our behaviors and dictating how we view the world. One of the most interesting things about memory is its imperfection. Rather than serving as a precise record of past events, our memories are more like concocted reflections, filtered and distilled from pure reality into a personal brew that is formulated by our own unique physiologies and emotional backgrounds. The wholly unique universe we each create—separate from but still tethered to the actual universe—is the product of electrical signals zapping through the lump of fatty flesh inside our skulls. Biology gives birth to something that exists outside the boundaries of biology.
ANDRZEJ KRAUZE
The neural machinery involved in the formation, storage, and retrieval of memories is coming to light in labs across the world, but science has not yet solved this particular puzzle. In this issue, you’ll read about talented researchers who use modern tools such as optogenetics and genome editing to probe the biology underlying memory. In lab animals, these scientists can force the recall of memories at the flick of a molecular switch, implant false memories, and erode a real memory to the point of vanishing. Through these studies and others, perhaps science will one day robustly characterize memory’s biological nuts and bolts. But will we ever truly understand, and perhaps directly manipulate, the personal reality created by each individual’s brain?
What scares me most at this juncture in world history is how the COVID-19 pandemic will live in the memories of those affected by it. The patchiness of the current global predicament will dictate our individual familiarity with the ravages of SARS-CoV-2. Some will remain largely unscathed by illness, many will feel the economic pinch of societal lockdowns, many will also lose friends or loved ones to the virus, others will succumb to it themselves. No one will emerge unchanged. 
Memories living within the survivors will mirror the array of individual experiences. For many, traumatic memories of the pandemic—whether that be illness from the virus or any of the hardships that come along with social isolation and the global economic downturn—will become uninvited guests, intruding on the daily business of living. On the opposite end of the spectrum, with any luck, many young people living through this reality will recall this period of their lives with a hazy bemusement. “Remember when we were kids, and we got to stay home from school with Mom and Dad for months on end?” Again, the mountain of memories that will accrue in this complicated time will not faithfully record the events now unfurling. Rather, they will form smudged reproductions of the difficulties we are all grappling with. Those memories, and the behaviors they drive, will linger, perhaps for generations.
The scientific enterprise is currently front and center. Millions around the world are counting on researchers and clinicians to pull us from the darkness of this pandemic, as dozens of drugs and vaccines make their way through development and organizations around the globe work to distribute accurate tests that can track the spread of the disease. And this is only the first battle. In the months and years to come, those of us who survive this episode will again call on healthcare providers and scientists to rescue us from the mental and physical aftereffects of the pandemic. For the foreseeable future, the world will need science and medicine more than ever before in recent history. And we will need humanity in equal measure. No matter the complexion of our memories of this time, it is my sincere hope that we can treat one another and the researchers striving to corral and vanquish this viral foe with understanding, compassion, and respect.
This issue of The Scientist is dedicated to the late Nicola F. Morabito (1923–2020), my grandfather and an inspiration to many. Memories of him, imperfect reflections of reality though they may be, will live on in me and in the others whose lives he touched.

Remdesivir Shows Promise in Largest of Several Clinical Trials/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KWANGMOOZAA
R
emdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola, has shown clinical benefit in a US clinical trial with 1,063 COVID-19 patients. While hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving a placebo took an average of 15 days to recover from the disease, patients taking remdesivir recovered in an average of 11 days—a reduction of 31 percent.
“Remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery,” reads a statement posted yesterday (April 29) by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). “More detailed information about the trial results, including more comprehensive data, will be available in a forthcoming report.”
The study did not conclusively demonstrate that the drug reduces mortality from COVID-19, although the NIAID statement noted that statistically insignificant results from the trial were suggestive of a survival benefit: the group receiving the drug had a mortality rate of 8 percent, compared to 11.6 percent for the group receiving a placebo.
See “Remdesivir Works Against Coronaviruses in the Lab”
Announcing the findings from the Oval Office, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said that the trial had “proven . . . that a drug can block this virus,” the Associated Press reports. He added that that “this will be the standard of care,” and that other potential treatments will be combined with or compared to remdesivir from now on.
The findings of the NIAID study contrast with the results of a smaller trial of remdesivir carried out in China that was published yesterday in the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet. That study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 237 COVID-19 patients across multiple centers, found that “remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefit,” although the data did show some reduction in time to recovery in patients taking the drug. The paper also reports that administration of the drug had to be stopped in several patients due to side effects.
Data from a Gilead-sponsored trial carried out at the University of Chicago, leaked and subsequently circulated this month by STAT News and other outlets, also showed apparently faster-than-normal recovery in COVID-19 patients taking remdesivir. But the absence of a control arm in that study made the findings difficult to interpret, and the University of Chicago told STAT in a statement at the time that “drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”
See “Flu and HIV Drugs Show Efficacy Against Coronavirus”
News of the drug’s apparent success has sent Gilead’s stock prices soaring since mid-April, with a jump of more than 11 percent in premarket trading yesterday morning. However, some researchers have expressed concerns about the way information about the drug trials has been made public.
Noting a lack of detail in Fauci’s announcement yesterday, Steven Nissen, chief academic officer at the Cleveland Clinic, tells Reuters, “I want to see the full data. I want to understand the statistics. I want to understand the benefit and risk. I want to understand the structure of the study, and all of it. . . . Am I encouraged from what I’ve heard? Yes, I’m encouraged. But I want to get a full understanding of what happened here, and not get it via a photo opportunity from the Oval Office.”
Fauci tells Reuters that the decision to make the trial findings public was partly driven by concerns that parts of the study would be leaked anyway, and could have led to public confusion. “I would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting,” he adds, “but it’s just not in the cards when you have a situation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the conversation.”

Robert May, Theoretical Ecologist Who Advised UK Gov’t, Dies/-/© THE ROYAL SOCIETY
A
lthough he started out his academic career studying theoretical physics, Robert “Bob” May is better known for his contributions to the field of ecology as well as for his political influence in the UK. The Australian scientist died this week (April 28) at age 84.
May earned his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Sydney in 1959 and spent a couple years at Harvard University before returning to his alma matter to become a senior lecturer and then professor. But after reading a book on ecology, May became fascinated with animal populations and communities, according to The Sunday Morning Herald. He joined the faculty of Princeton University in 1973 and began developing models for understanding the basic dynamics of ecological systems.
“He transformed the science of ecology from a descriptive, observational discipline into a theoretical science with a firm mathematical basis,” Hamish McCallum of the University of Griffith, which awarded May the title of Doctor of the University in 2015, tells Griffith News.
May also used his mathematical prowess to predict the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, with his models yielding more-accurate projections than the World Health Organization’s, the Herald reports. McCallum notes that May’s modeling legacy extends to the current outbreak of COVID-19. “The models being used to guide the management of the coronavirus pandemic all have their genesis in the seminal work Lord Robert May undertook 40 years ago with Sir Roy Anderson,” he tells Griffith News.
May moved to the UK in 1988, where he served as a Royal Society professor of zoology with appointments at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford until he became UK’s chief scientific advisor in 1995. In that role for five years, May responded to the rising voices of those opposed to genetically modified (GM) foods and fought to reverse a dipping budget for scientific research, according to the Herald.
In 2000, he became the president of the Royal Society. Two years later, Queen Elizabeth II appointed May to the Order of Merit, a highly selective membership that celebrates individuals who have made substantial contributions to society through the armed forces, science, art, literature, and more. This followed May’s knighting in 1996. In 2007, he took home the Royal Society’s most prestigious prize, the Copley Medal, which has also been awarded to Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Stephen Hawking.
“[He was] awarded virtually every honour the British establishment could offer,” McCallum tells Griffith News.
See “Robert May: Out like a lion”
“Robert May was an extraordinary man who drove great change in every domain he committed his talents to,” Venki Ramakrishnan, the current president of the Royal Society, says in a statement. “Bob was a natural communicator and used every available avenue to share his message that science and reason should lie at the heart of society, and he did so with a fervent pursuit that resonates with those of the Society’s founding members.”
He is survived by his wife, Judith, and their daughter, Nome.
Receptors for SARS-CoV-2 Present in Wide Variety of Human Cells/-/ABOVE: Human cell types within corresponding organs that express the genes for both ACE2 and CTSL (green dot) or both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (orange dot).
ANNA HUPALOWSKA

hen the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the human body, it breaks into cells with the help of two proteins that it finds there, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While there has been much discussion of viral infection in gut and lung cells, researchers have dug into massive gene expression datasets to show that other potential target cells also producing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are scattered throughout the body—including in the heart, bladder, pancreas, kidney, and nose. There are even some in the eye and brain.
The results, published in a preprint on bioRxiv April 21, show that such cells are strikingly abundant. Many are epithelial cells, which line the outer surface of organs. The new findings add to an emerging picture of SARS-CoV-2 as a virus that can target cells in many places in the human body, rather than being focused on a particular organ or part of the respiratory tract. 
Cardiologist Frank Ruschitzka at the University Hospital of Zürich and colleagues separately published a letter in The Lancet April 17 in which they described how virus particles had been found in the vascular endothelium, a thin layer of cells lining blood vessels in various organs of the body, for instance. 
“This is not just a virus pneumonia,” Ruschitzka, who was not involved in the latest study, tells The Scientist, referring to COVID-19. “This is a disease like we have never seen before—it is not an influenza, it hits the vessels all over, it hits the heart as well.”
See “Lost Smell and Taste Hint COVID-19 Can Target the Nervous System”
To uncover the locations of cells bearing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the preprint researchers turned to the Human Cell Atlas, a project that has allowed scientists to pool together data on human cells since 2016. 
By scouring single-cell sequencing records of around 1.2 million individual cells from human tissue samples, the team was able to find out which of those cells produce both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and note their locations in the body. The analysis used 16 unpublished datasets of lung and airway cells and 91 published datasets spanning a range of human organs. 
Coauthor Christoph Muus, a graduate student at Harvard University and the Broad Institute, explains that while the data show cells in many locations in the body produce SARS-CoV-2 receptors, it’s not certain that the virus can infect all of those tissues.
“Expressing the receptor is a necessary condition but not necessarily a sufficient condition,” he says. For example, potential target cells were found in the testes, but scientists still don’t know if SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in that part of the body.
Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, says the preprint provides important details about the human body that may help scientists understand how SARS-CoV-2 infects hosts. By finding viral protein fragments in tissue samples from patients who died because of COVID-19, scientists might be able to firm up which organs are genuine sites of infection, he adds.
“I’d say this paper gives people a roadmap at where you might want to look in the body to understand where this virus is going,” he says.
One limitation of the work is that relatively little metadata about the people who donated tissue samples were available for the various datasets, though information about age and gender were included in many. The researchers don’t know, for example, whether there was an ethnicity bias in the data, whether patients had pre-existing conditions, or whether they were taking any medications. All of these things could affect gene expression in particular cells.
Smoking status was available for a subset of the data, and the team used this to show that smoking is correlated with a greater expression of the ACE2 gene in the upper airway, but lower expression in certain lung cells. Further research is needed to understand whether this affects smokers’ susceptibility to COVID-19. Data from China suggest that smokers are 14 times more likely to develop a severe form of the disease.
Some researchers from the same group using similar data have also recently published papers in Cell and Nature. In those cases, the researchers focused on certain groups of cells. The study reported in Nature examined cells potentially involved in viral transmission and found that nasal epithelial cells, in particular, were associated with expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The authors report that the virus might exploit cells that secrete fluids in the nasal passage, which might help it spread from one person to another in droplets released, say, when someone sneezes.
The Cell study, meanwhile, also found ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts in nasal, gut, and lung cells but the researchers also found that the protein interferon activated ACE2 expression in vitro. The human body uses interferon to fight infections, so it is not clear whether the protein is of overall benefit or detriment to COVID-19 patients. 
The use of so many different data sources backs up the validity of the preprint authors’ findings, says Marta Gaglia, a molecular biologist at Tufts University. She agrees with the researchers that discovering ACE2- and TMPRSS2-producing cells in various places around the body does not prove the virus can always infect such cells.
“I think the reality is that most of the problems come from the lung,” she adds. Plus, while doctors treating COVID-19 patients may detect problems in multiple organs, those issues might not necessarily be caused directly by SARS-CoV-2 infection, says Gaglia. A problematic immune system response, for instance, could damage certain tissues in the body as an indirect consequence of viral infection.
The Pandemic’s Effects on Recruiting International STEM Trainees/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, METAMORWORKS
A
t Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC in Roanoke, postdoc Carmen Muñoz Ballester has been working around the clock as part of the team developing a testing protocol for COVID-19. She typically studies traumatic brain injury and temporarily switched gears to join the COVID-19 group. Last week, they got approval from state and federal regulators to put the protocol to work analyzing patient samples collected by regional health departments and health centers.
Like about half of the life science postdocs in the US, Muñoz Ballester is not a US citizen. She grew up in Spain and earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees there. About one-third of the science and engineering doctoral degrees awarded each year in the US also go to international graduate students.
Pandemic-related concerns that have arisen for science trainees—shuttered labs, research and education delays, anxiety—are applicable across the board. But international graduate students and postdocs face a suite of unique challenges that raise uncertainty about recruiting and supporting this critical group of researchers in the future.
Planned visa renewals for students and postdocs who have positions and funding, as well as new visa applications from students who have been admitted for fall, are all on hold as of March 20.
“The international students and the role they play in support of the STEM fields is of great concern. They are a significant part of the STEM workforce,” says Tobin Smith, the vice president for policy at the Association of American Universities (AAU). The biggest concerns surround visas—both the process of obtaining them and the restrictions they impose on holders.
Before coming to the US, international students usually apply for an F-1 visa, while prospective postdocs apply for either a J-1 or H-1B visa. These give trainees permission to learn and work in the US, while placing limits on the duration of time they can spend outside the US. The visas typically last for the expected duration of training, but must be renewed periodically by visiting a US embassy or consulate in the student’s or postdoc’s home country.
“Because I have a J-1 visa, if I’m abroad for more than 30 days, I can lose my status,” says Muñoz Ballester. Given more visa-related flexibility, she might have chosen to go home to Spain to be with family during the pandemic. “There’s the emotional part of knowing that you are far” from loved ones, she says, and then the feeling of being restricted. “You have two options, leaving your family alone or leaving your job.”
Planned visa renewals for students and postdocs who have positions and funding, as well as new visa applications from students who have been admitted for fall, are all on hold as of March 20. That’s because the requirement for an in-person interview can’t be met as most visa offices around the world are closed due to the coronavirus.
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the State Department have issued guidance that allows for more flexibility—including remote learning, either in the US or in students’ home countries—for students on F-1 visas, but as of now that guidance only extends to current students, says Meredith Asbury, a policy officer at the AAU. Her organization and other higher education advocacy groups have asked for more guidance, including extending visas for students and the provisions that allow for remote learning, in three letters to the agencies.
The effects of travel bans on international students
It’s also unclear when travel restrictions are going to be lifted and when international travel will start again, she adds. “In addition to that, there’s still the possibility of another presidential order extending additional immigration restrictions, which could add another layer.”
As of March 11, presidential proclamations had banned people who aren’t American citizens from traveling to the US if they’ve been in China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and any of 26 European countries in the preceding 14 days. And on April 22, another presidential proclamation placed a 60-day suspension on issuing green cards for people who want to come from abroad, but does not affect F-1, J-1, and H-1B temporary visas.
See “As Visa Difficulties Persist, Scientists Push for Change”
“As institutions are figuring out what their fall semesters are going to look like, that becomes a challenge when they don’t know if the federal guidance is going to match up with what their institution is looking to do in terms of the flexibility in instruction,” Asbury says. “Institutions are still admitting students for the fall, but if the students decide to come or if they’re able to get here in time, that’s still unclear.”
If international students don’t come either because of visa issues or travel and immigration bans, it could affect both the finances and execution of research and higher education in the US.
“Based on [federal] policies that made immigration more challenging the last couple of years, across the country, we saw a decline in PhD admissions. That’s the biggest import of international students we see,” says Sudha Krishnamurthy, the director of the office of postdoctoral and graduate student affairs at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. “And we saw a [corresponding] decline in the number of applications given how many fewer international admissions there were.”
The Council of Graduate Schools has done a yearly report on international student applications, admissions, and enrollments since 2004. For the first time since fall 2003, it found that 2017 applications from international graduate students dropped by 3 percent and enrollment by 1 percent compared to 2016. The 2019 report from the Council of Graduate Schools showed that for fall 2018, applications from international graduate students fell by 4 percent and first-time enrollment was down 1 percent from 2017. The bulk of the declines were from master’s and certificate programs, and from students from the Middle East and North Africa, where five of the seven nations included in the January 2017 travel ban are located. For instance, in fall 2017, applications from prospective Iranian students dropped by 18 percent.
Ripple effects to the broader research community
A global pandemic, coupled with these immigration-related challenges, is likely going to mean a further decline of people coming in to the US, Krishnamurthy adds.
“It makes a really big difference whether we just have a temporary glitch or this goes on for some time. And nobody knows if it’s going to go on for some time,” says Dick Startz, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. While the department or university supports most PhD students in the sciences in the US, many international undergraduate and master’s students pay full tuition—funds that then go to support the department. If these international students don’t come in the fall, institutions “could take an incredible financial hit,” he says.
“Most basic research in the United States comes from universities and that research absolutely requires PhD students and postdocs to make it happen,” Startz adds. “The commercialization often happens in private companies, but the underlying ideas come out of universities. No PhDs and no postdocs pretty much means no labs. No labs means a hell of a lot fewer new ideas and products.”
Beyond the immediate financial impact, losing international trainees could have ripple effects down the line. “Our high tech industry depends on hiring well-trained scientists and there’s going to be a big shortage of them” if international students don’t come here at all or can’t get a visa to stay and work for American companies, Startz says, adding that many international doctoral students are more likely than American students to go into industry.
Recruiting international postdocs may also change, not only due to current issues of global mobility, but also based on how the scientific world will respond to the pandemic, says Anita Corbett, a biologist at Emory University. Often you meet future trainees at a meeting, but if meetings become virtual, those interactions are going to be really different. “There probably are going to be long-term implications and ramifications of this acute phase that are going to play out in some ways that we still don’t understand,” she adds. There’s a “risk of [science] becoming less diverse and creating a less rich learning environment for everyone.”
The way to continue to recruit the best people from around the world is to get creative, says Malú Tansey, a neuroscientist at the University of Florida. She and her colleagues are planning virtual postdoc fairs with several professors recruiting at once, so that trainees from all over can match up with investigators whose research would be a good fit. And she remains optimistic barriers to studying and working in the US will be surmountable. “We need to convince these international students that it might be a little harder, but that it’s still worth it because we can provide a good training environment, good infrastructure, and really a commitment to develop their work.”
Other things that would help support trainees once they are here, adds Muñoz Ballester, are expanding visa time and providing more funding opportunities. Her J-1 visa is good for up to five years, but during the pandemic, she’s already lost months of productivity. The National Institutes of Health now allows applicants for the K99—one of the only training awards international postdocs can apply for—to apply to extend their eligibility beyond the four years of postdoc experience that applicants are typically limited to. But that increased flexibility matters less if visas for international postdocs can’t be similarly extended.
How (Not) to Do an Antibody Survey for SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE:  © ISTOCK.COM, LUOMAN 
Update (May 18): A whistleblower complaint filed last week with Stanford University reveals that the Santa Clara study was partially funded by JetBlue Airways founder David Neeleman, who has spoken out against the use of lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, BuzzFeed News reports. The information, which was not publicly disclosed, raises “concern that the authors were affected by a severe conflict of interest,” according to the complaint, which was filed by someone involved with the research. The complaint also suggests that the study’s authors disregarded warnings raised by Stanford professors about the accuracy of the antibody test used. In interviews with BuzzFeed, Neeleman and study coauthor Eran Bendavid denied that Neeleman or other funders had influenced the study. 
Update (May 1): Bhattacharya and colleagues respond to criticisms of the Santa Clara study in a revised preprint posted yesterday. Using updated statistical analyses, the team now estimates that between 1.3 percent and 4.7 percent of the county’s population—the equivalent of 25,000–91,000 people—have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
I
n mid-April, an eye-catching statistic appeared in the news: the number of people who’d been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the California county of Santa Clara was 50 to 85 times higher than thought. While just 956 cases of COVID-19 had been officially recorded by April 1, the true number of infections was between 48,000 and 81,000, outlets reported.
The news drew from a preprint posted to medRxiv on April 17 describing what’s known as a seroprevalence survey. A team led by researchers at Stanford University had tested 3,330 people for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 50 had shown up positive. Using statistical analyses to extrapolate their findings, the team concluded that the county’s infection rate was 2.5–4.2 percent, or 48,000–81,000 people.
These elevated numbers were reassuring, some outlets noted, because they suggest that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are milder than feared—a point seized on by conservative political commentators and some of the study’s own coauthors as support for the view that restrictive lockdown measures are an overreaction.
But epidemiologists, statisticians, and other many other researchers were quick to express concerns—on Twitter and in lengthy blog posts—about several aspects of the study, from the choice of testing kit to the recruitment of participants to the statistical treatment of the data.
“I did not anticipate the firestorm,” Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and the study’s senior author, tells The Scientist. The team stands by the findings, he adds, but plans to rework parts of the paper following the criticisms. “It’s a preprint.”
That the study received so much attention is partly a testament to just how central antibody testing has become to the discourse about COVID-19 in recent weeks. This kind of test aims to detect people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to PCR-based diagnostics that pick up active cases of the disease. Public health experts and politicians see it as a critical tool in understanding the virus’s true spread and the epidemiological effects of lockdowns and other attempts at mitigation.
Some epidemiologists and statisticians argue that the preprint’s results are consistent with all or most of the 50 reported positives being false.
Yet not all seroprevalence studies are created equal—a point that needs to be clear when discussing the implications of their findings, says Eva Harris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. Harris is planning a long-term study of thousands of people across the East Bay area to monitor how seroprevalence and the number of asymptomatic infections in the community respond to changes in COVID-19 mitigation strategies.
“I think that it’s really important that many places do seroprevalence studies—I’m super supportive of that,” Harris says. “I also think it’s incredibly important that people understand the limitations” of individual studies, she continues. “The study design and the test used and the interpretation have to be transparent to the [scientific] community, and there has to be some way to communicate that to the public.”
Serology ramps up
Governments in countries including the UK, Spain, and Italy are planning largescale seroprevalence surveys, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently announced that it plans to recruit up to 10,000 people in the US for its own study. Many US states and institutions are running local versions, too.
Of the few studies reporting data so far, most appear to have found broadly the same thing as the Santa Clara study—that the true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is higher than official case counts capture, but low as a proportion of the population in most areas.
Last week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that researchers had found antibodies in 21 percent of roughly 1,300 people surveyed outside grocery stores and other shops in New York City—one of the worst-hit regions in the world. Virologists in Germany who surveyed 500 people in the town of Heinsberg told reporters a couple weeks ago that they’d found antibodies in nearly 15 percent. (Both announcements were light on methodological details.)
Another study by Bhattacharya and others estimated a seroprevalence of around 4.1 percent in Los Angeles County, California, based on a survey of 863 people. The study report, which was leaked and temporarily hosted on conservative website RedState.com, is not publicly available, Bhattacharya says, though there is a press release available from the county. The findings have been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, he adds.
How to choose an antibody test
A major concern raised about the Santa Clara study was that the type of antibody test used was too inaccurate to support the paper’s conclusions—a concern that epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan says she shares. For seroprevalence studies, “the top thing you’re going to think about is test performance,” says Gordon, who’s worked on surveys of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue and is currently developing a lab-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody test.
Both the Santa Clara and the LA County studies used a test kit manufactured by Chinese company Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, which is not on China’s approved manufacturers list and has since been banned from exporting its kits, NBC reports. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows this kind of kit to be marketed in the US, but has not formally approved it or vouched for its efficacy.
If you’re estimating a rare disease, it will only work if your test has a very low false positive rate.
—Andrew Gelman, Columbia University
The test is based on what’s known as a lateral flow immunoassay and is designed to detect antibodies in blood taken from a finger prick. Unlike lab-based tests on larger blood samples, which allow for repeat testing and provide quantitative results of antibody abundance, these so-called “point-of-care” kits return a one-off “positive” or “negative” based on some threshold antibody level set by the manufacturer.  
For some researchers in public health, this is a non-starter. “I don’t think any of the current point-of-care tests are appropriate for use in seroprevalence surveys,” says Michael Busch, the director of Vitalant Research Institute, a nonprofit transfusion medicine organization. His team is coordinating a long-term, NIH-funded seroprevalence study using lab-based tests of donor blood across the US—initially in six metropolitan areas, but later in additional parts of the country.
Good antibody surveys require samples that can be retested, he adds. While lateral flow immunoassays offer rapid results, they’re “very non-specific [and] are not amenable to repeat testing and confirmation. . . . If you don’t have a good test, there’s no point in running a serologic survey.”  
Neeraj Sood, the vice dean for research at the University of Southern California’s Price School of Public Policy and a collaborator on both the Santa Clara and LA County studies, argues that you “don’t need a perfect test,” provided you understand the test’s performance—in particular, its sensitivity and specificity.
A very sensitive test returns no or few false negatives for people who have the antibodies. A very specific test returns no or few false positives for people who don’t. When trying to detect something relatively rare such as SARS-CoV-2, specificity is usually the primary consideration because it’s important to avoid the detection of other things in the blood—such as antibodies for any of the relatively harmless coronaviruses already common in humans.
The Heinsburg researchers used a test they claimed had a false positive rate of less than 1 in 100—although other groups have challenged that assessment after running their own assays. The Santa Clara study, meanwhile, reported a rate of 2 in 401.
These false positive rates are rather too high when you take into account statistical uncertainty around those numbers, says Andrew Gelman, a Columbia University statistician who detailed several criticisms and “avoidable screwups” in the Santa Clara preprint on his blog. “It’s a well-known problem in all the introductory probability textbooks,” he adds. “If you’re estimating a rare disease, it will only work if your test has a very low false positive rate.”
For a virus that infects 1 percent of the population, say, a test with a known false positive rate of 1 in 100 is expected to return as many false positives as true positives. Based on the quoted specificity of the test kit used in Santa Clara, some epidemiologists and statisticians argue that the preprint’s results are consistent with all or most of the 50 reported positives being false.
Bhattacharya says that critics focus too much on test specificity, rather than on the combined effect of specificity and sensitivity on the expected number of positives and negatives. He adds that new data on the test’s specificity will be published in the revised preprint, and that the team is confident about the test’s performance.  
Most large seroprevalence surveys have avoided the kind of test used in the Santa Clara study. Like Busch, Harris says her team will rely on well-validated, lab-based tests for its East Bay study. The researchers plan to look for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood collected from finger pricks and for viral DNA in saliva collected using oral and nasal swabs. They will also collect venous blood draws from a subset of 500 participants—250 positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 250 negative—and use them to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the tests used on finger-prick blood.
How to recruit participants
For their Santa Clara study, the Stanford researchers posted advertisements on Facebook saying they were “looking for participants to get tested for antibodies to COVID-19.” The reasons for this strategy were practical, says Sood: social media offers a fast, cheap way of getting people involved.
As readers pointed out, this kind of recruitment strategy can introduce selection bias, as people who think there’s a chance they’ve been infected may be most likely to participate. If at least some people have grounds to be worried, this effect can lead to a higher proportion of infected people in the sample than in the general population—though Sood notes biases can run the other way, too, if “worried well” people who overestimate their risk also decide to take part.
Within days of the preprint being posted, scientists and members of the public were using Twitter to share evidence that selection bias may have been an issue, as people encouraged friends who thought they’d been exposed or had COVID-19–like symptoms to participate in the study, and in some cases seemed confused about whether participation would result in a diagnosis. (It didn’t.)
Compounding these concerns, BuzzFeed News revealed last Friday (April 24) that participants were also recruited via an email sent by Bhattacharya’s wife, radiation oncologist Catherine Su, the day before the study started. The email, which Bhattacharya told BuzzFeed he had nothing to do with, falsely claimed the test was “FDA approved,” and would tell people “if you are immune” and “FREE from the danger of a) getting sick or b) spreading the virus.”  
Bhattacharya tells The Scientist that the researchers learned of Su’s email only after it was sent. The team subsequently tried to correct for bias by upping recruitment from parts of the county not targeted by the email. These and other methodological details omitted from the preprint will be addressed in the revision, Bhattacharya adds.
Other seroprevalence studies are taking precautions to avoid or minimize recruitment biases as much as possible. Vitalant’s study, for example, is using donor blood from people who have previously consented for their blood to be used in scientific research in general, rather for than a specific test related to COVID-19. Since March, and with the goal of continuing through the summer, the group has been working to collect 1,000 samples per month from each of the six study sites, along with demographic information about the donors.
We don’t know whether the antibodies that result in seropositivity provide any protection against re-infection.
—Joseph Wu, Hong Kong University
This population is biased toward people healthy enough to give blood, Busch acknowledges, but he notes that, based on previous studies Vitalant has conducted for outbreaks of dengue, Zika, and other viruses, the approach has “proven to be quite informative in the ways we can generalize from blood donors to the general population.”
Another option, Gordon says, is to select people randomly, from a roster of residents in a county, say, or members of a university community. Setting quotas for age, race, and other demographic characteristics allows researchers to recruit a group that reflects as much as possible the wider community in that area—a particularly pertinent issue for research relating to COVID-19, which appears to hit some parts of society more than others. US hospital statistics assembled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, indicate that the disease is disproportionately affecting Black Americans, as well as causing more serious infections in older people and men compared with the rest of the population.
Achieving representation is a difficult task for studies that recruit via social media. In the Santa Clara study, only 5 percent of participants were over the age of 65, despite seniors making up around 13 percent of county residents. Non-Hispanic whites made up nearly two-thirds of the study group, but account for less than one-third of the Santa Clara community. The authors note in their preprint that they were able to statistically adjust for some but not all of these demographic discrepancies.
Even roster-based approaches are still susceptible to selection bias, Gordon notes, as people invited to take part have to provide consent—a decision that may be affected by a person’s perceived level of exposure risk. In this situation, it can be difficult to know if the sample is biased or not, she adds, but researchers can address the problem by collecting additional data about who agrees to participate and why, so that attitudes toward testing can be controlled for later in the analyses.
Harris notes that the East Bay study, which will invite people to participate via flyers in English and Spanish sent to every home in the region, will collect this kind of information, as well as details about the likelihood of exposure in the time leading up to participants’ provision of samples.
How to communicate a study’s results responsibly
For many researchers, the problems with the antibody surveys reported so far lie not just in how the work was carried out but in the conclusions the authors have drawn and subsequently publicized.
One of the Santa Clara preprint’s coauthors, biotech investor Andrew Bogan, used a Wall Street Journal op-ed to argue that the study’s findings meant COVID-19 mortality is close to that of seasonal flu, despite criticisms of the study’s methods and the fact epidemiologists have raised concerns about underreporting of deaths as well as infections.
The op-ed, which didn’t initially disclose Bogan’s involvement in the preprint, also questioned the logic of lockdowns around the country in light of the seroprevalence data. Bhattacharya, along with Stanford study coauthors Eran Bendavid and John Ioannidis, made similar points in interviews and opinion articles before and after the preprint was posted.
See “Opinion: Public Health Trumps Privacy in a Pandemic”
A two-page summary of the Heinsberg study (translated using Google Translate), meanwhile, concludes that around 15 percent of the population now has “immunity” to SARS-CoV-2 and “can no longer be infected.” Study coauthor Hendrik Streeck of the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn had said in interviews in late March that he thought SARS-CoV-2 was “not that dangerous.”
Although some of these conclusions may turn out to be correct, researchers tell The Scientist that they’re not supported by current scientific evidence—least of all by the seroprevalence studies they cite. Indeed, antibody testing is unlikely to be the solution to the lockdown measures that some people think it is, Busch adds.
I did not anticipate the firestorm. It’s a preprint.
—Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford University
“While seropositivity . . . is a good proxy for infective exposure, it does not necessarily indicate seroprotection,” Joseph Wu, a disease modeler at Hong Kong University who is involved in a long-term seroprevalence study using lab-based blood tests to monitor different age groups’ exposure to SARS-CoV-2, writes in an email to The Scientist. “This means we don’t know whether the antibodies that result in seropositivity provide any protection against re-infection.” Studies that take a snapshot of seroprevalence at a particular time and place are instead useful as ways of “estimating the proportion of true infections that have been under-reported,” he adds, which in turn can be used to more accurately estimate infection rates in the future.
See “What Do Antibody Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?”
Harris agrees that antibodies and immunity are “two different things.” She notes that antibody levels vary substantially between people and wane over time, and that researchers don’t yet understand the effect of repeated SARS-CoV-2 exposure on a person’s risk of getting sick—an important consideration when modeling the effects of some other viruses. Long-term studies are needed to understand these kinds of patterns and their influence on the future spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While Harris says she hopes that the number of severe or fatal infections really is a tiny proportion of the overall tally, she notes that the data reported so far still suggest the vast majority of people haven’t been exposed.
“Even in the best-case scenario,” she adds, “where there’s a lot of people infected and only a small percentage that gets really sick, look how sick they’ve become and look what it’s done to the healthcare system.”
NIH Cancels Funding for Bat Coronavirus Research Project/-/ABOVE: The canceled grant included money for surveillance of coronaviruses in Yunnan, China.

Update (August 28): STAT reports that the NIH has awarded EcoHealth Alliance new funding as part of a grant to a network of institutions and research teams that will “work to determine how and where viruses and other new pathogens emerge from nature to begin infecting people.”
Update (August 19): According to a Wall Street Journal report and a statement by EcoHealth Alliance, NIH reversed its termination of the grant but suspended funding until EcoHealth meets new requirements, including arranging an inspection of the Wuhan Institute of Virology by an outside team. “NIH’s letter does not represent a good faith effort to understand the nature of our ongoing research,” EcoHealth says in its statement, but “imposes on us a series of demands that the NIH is fully aware many governments and the World Health Organization alike have been unable to successfully satisfy.”
Update (May 26): Last week, 77 Nobel laureates and 31 scientific societies separately sent letters to NIH Director Francis Collins criticizing the decision to terminate the grant and urging that it be reviewed, Science reports.
A
grant to a New York nonprofit aimed at detecting and preventing future outbreaks of coronaviruses from bats has been canceled by the National Institutes of Health, Politico reports, apparently at the direction of President Donald Trump because the research involved the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. The virology institute has become a focal point for the idea that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from the laboratory and caused the current COVID-19 pandemic, a scenario experts say is not supported by evidence. Instead, virologists The Scientist has spoken to say the virus most likely jumped from infected animals to humans.
The grant, first awarded in fiscal year 2014 and most recently renewed last year, went to EcoHealth Alliance, which describes itself as “a global environmental health nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and public health from the emergence of disease.” The aims of the funded project included characterizing coronaviruses present in bat populations in southern China and conducting surveillance to detect spillover events of such viruses to people. The project has resulted in 20 publications, most recently a March report on zoonotic risk factors in rural southern China.
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
EcoHealth Alliance’s partners on the project include researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a BSL-4 facility that has for months been a focus of conspiracy theories that SARS-CoV-2 escaped or was released from a lab. On April 14, the The Washington Post published a column highlighting State Department cables about concerns regarding safety at the institute. (Experts tell NPR that, even in light of the cables, accidental escape of the virus from a lab remains a far less likely scenario than a jump from animals.) 
Then, in an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter, whom Politico identifies as being from Newsmax, falsely stated in a question that “US intelligence is saying this week that the coronavirus likely came from a level 4 lab in Wuhan,” and that the NIH had awarded a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab. “Why would the US give a grant like that to China?” she asked. “We will end that grant very quickly,” Trump said in his answer.
See “Theory that Coronavirus Escaped from a Lab Lacks Evidence”
An NIH official then wrote to EcoHealth Alliance to inquire about money sent to “China-based participants in this work,” Politico reports, and the organization’s head, Peter Daszak, responded that a complete response would take time, but that “I can categorically state that no fund from [the grant] have been sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor has any contract been signed.” Days later, NIH notified EcoHealth Alliance that future funding for the project was canceled, and that it must immediately “stop spending the $369,819 remaining from its 2020 grant”—an unusual move generally reserved for cases of scientific misconduct or financial improprieties, according to Politico.
In a statement about the cancellation, EcoHealth Alliance says the terminated research “aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats,” and that it addresses “all four strategic research priorities of the NIH/NIAID Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research, released just this week.” The organization will, it says, “continue our fight against this and other emerging diseases.”
Strokes Reported Among Some Middle-Aged COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: A field hospital in Central Park, set up to treat coronavirus patients, across from Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York

S
everal hospitals in the US have observed strokes in a number of patients being treating for coronavirus, leading to concern that the infection may be causing devastating blockages in the brain. For at least two facilities, these events account for a spike in stroke cases among middle-aged patients.
“Our report shows a seven-fold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks,” Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who describes five of his patients in an upcoming paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, tells CNN. “Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of Covid.”
Although the numbers of stroke incidents among coronavirus patients remains low, The Washington Post notes that three medical centers in the US will be publishing reports on dozens of COVID-19 patients who experienced strokes. And these appear to be the most serious kind of stroke, called a large vessel occlusion, which might account for the surge in the number of people who have died at home during the pandemic, but this cannot be confirmed.  
Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals and NYU Langone Health found that 40 percent of the 12 people treated for large vessel blockage who also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were under age 50, according to the Post. “We are used to thinking of 60 as a young patient when it comes to large vessel occlusions,” Eytan Raz of NYU Langone tells the newspaper. “We have never seen so many in their 50s, 40s and late 30s.”
Oxley tells Medscape Medical News that the virus may be causing inflammation in blood vessels, leading to blood clots. Raz speculates that perhaps because younger people don’t suffer the respiratory issues that take a toll on older COVID-19 patients, they survive long enough for the virus to cause damage elsewhere.
See “Blood Pressure Meds Point the Way to COVID-19 Treatment”
Oxley tells CNN that two of the patients had delayed calling an ambulance when they began experiencing symptoms, but that it’s critical to act fast to treat stroke. Of the five Mount Sinai patients that Oxley describes in his upcoming paper, one patient died, one remains in the hospital, two are in rehabilitation, and one is at home, Medscape reports. The outlet also notes that Oxley and his colleagues dedicated their upcoming report to Gary Sclar, a stroke doctor and colleague who died of COVID-19 while caring for patients.
Nearly All NYC-Area COVID-19 Hospitalizations Had Comorbidities/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SUDOK1
A
new study published April 22 in the Journal of the American Medical Association characterizes the symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes of 5,700 patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 in the New York area. The authors found that 94 percent of the patients had a chronic health problem, and 88 percent had two or more. The three most prevalent conditions were hypertension (56.6 percent), obesity (41.7 percent), and diabetes (33.8 percent).
The study followed patients confirmed to have COVID-19 between March 1 and April 4, spanning 12 New York City–area hospitals. Patients ranged from babies to centenarians with a median age of 63. Around 40 percent of them were female.
The findings were observational of patients with severe illness and the health conditions correlated with these patients do not necessarily apply to all COVID-19 cases or represent causation. 
“We’re simply describing the patients who came in and required hospitalization,” senior author Karina Davidson, a senior vice president at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, tells The New York Times. “We are not comparing them to those who were positive and stayed out of the hospital, or who didn’t get infected, or to patients with any other disease.”
Although the World Health Organization lists fever as a common symptom of COVID-19, the study found that around two-thirds of the patients “did not have a fever and yet were sick enough to need to be hospitalized,” Davidson tells Newsday. “That’s the kind of important finding we thought needs to get out right away.”
A total of 1,151 patients were put on ventilators during their hospitalization. Of those, 831 remained intubated at the end of the study, 282 patients died, and 38 were discharged. None of the patients under 20 years old died, and men died at a higher rate than women. Forty-five patients were re-admitted after being discharged from the hospital after an average of three days at home.
The authors admit there are many limitations to the study including the length of observation, the geographic area, incomplete medical records, and a lack of control group. Still, they say, this is a beginning to accurately characterizing COVID-19 in patients.
“Is there any pattern of symptoms that predicts a worse outcome or predicts people are in fact going to be safe and can be managed at home?” Davidson tells NBC News. “We think that’s the burning question.”

obert Carroll, a vertebrate paleontologist at McGill University who helped combine paleontology with evolutionary biology and genetics, died on April 8 as a result of COVID-19 at the age of 81.
He was a professor emeritus of biology at McGill University, where he conducted research from 1964–2003. He had also been a curator and eventually director of the Redpath Museum in Montreal. He was the “academic grandfather of Canadian paleontology,” Hans Larsson a paleontologist at McGill University tells The Scientist. “So many of his students and then their students have gone on to create this big critical mass of vertebrate paleontology in Canada. So much so that we organized and created our own society,” the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
Robert Carroll
COURTESY MCGILL UNIVERSITY
According to the Redpath Museum website, Carroll was well known for having identified the oldest known ancestor of all reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Carroll was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 1938. An article about him winning the Romer-Simpson medal says Carroll had been interested in paleontology early in his childhood. His parents took him to visit digging sites in South Dakota and Wyoming. As he grew up, his passion never waned; it led him to obtain a bachelor’s degree in geology from Michigan State University and a PhD from Harvard University.
He studied amphibians using molecular developmental biology methods to determine what made fish climb onto land and evolve into the land-dwelling species alive today. Carroll described the idea that the aquatic ancestors crawled out of the water to warm themselves in the sun, making them more active and helping them catch fish. Over time, they evolved larger fins and eventually limbs that resembled hands or feet that helped them move more easily on land.
Later in his career, he focused on how amphibians such as frogs evolved to lay eggs that hatch and mature in the water but grow into animals that live on land. He was “not the kind of scientist where he would sit down and focus on one topic for the rest of his career,” says Larsson. “He was really interested in sort of new ideas like, ‘how can developmental biology be incorporated into paleontology?’ And these big, big sort of macro-scale questions.”
Carroll’s work was recognized with several awards, including the Romer-Simpson Medal in 2004, the Willet G. Miller Medal in 2001, and the Charles Schuchert Award in 1987. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1993 and was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2019.
A former McGill student, Emily Bamforth, now a curatorial assistant at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum, tweeted, “Bob Carrol was a giant in the palaeontology world. I had the honour of knowing him when I was a student @mcgillu. Though a professor emeritus at the time, he came in almost every day, bounding up the stairs of the @RedpathMuseum, two at a time. He will be deeply missed.”
According to an obituary in the Montreal Gazette, the Society of Vertebrate Biology is working on setting up an award in his name.
Carroll is survived by his wife, Anna DiTuri, his son David, his granddaughter Juliette, and his extended family, Angela, Vito, Filomena, and Vito.
Neurobiologist and Former Stanford President Donald Kennedy Dies/-/ABOVE: Donald Kennedy at the Stanford faculty senate

D
onald Kennedy, a neurobiologist and Stanford University’s eighth president from 1980 to 1992, died on April 21 of COVID-19, according to a university press release. He was 88 years old.
From 1977 to 1979, Kennedy served as the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was the editor-in-chief of Science from 2000 to 2008, according to the statement. As president of Stanford, Kennedy is remembered for his commitments to both teaching and public service, including launching a program now called the Haas Center for Public Service, which offers the Donald Kennedy Public Service Fellowship for undergraduates conducting summer service projects.
“As we mourn the loss of Don Kennedy, we also salute his enormous contributions to Stanford and to our country,” says Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne in the press release. “As a biologist, as a national voice for science, as a vigorous leader of Stanford University and as an engaging teacher beloved by so many students, Don brought to his endeavors an enduring commitment to academic excellence, a deep wellspring of warmth and good humor and a vision for the possibilities always ahead of Stanford.”
Born in New York City on August 18, 1931, Kennedy studied at Harvard University, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1952, a master’s degree in 1954, and a PhD in 1956, the release says. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1960, where he taught in biological sciences and the interdisciplinary Program in Human Biology.
In his scientific research, Kennedy showed that stimulating a single nerve cell in the crayfish central nervous system could elicit complex motor activity, the statement says. He also invented a technique by which dye is injected into single nerve cells, thereby illuminating the axon, dendrite, and cell body.
Kennedy wrote about Stanford undergraduates in his 2018 memoir, A Place in the Sun, according to the university statement, recalling, “During my 12 years as University president, I made a conscientious effort to carve out time to interact with these talented young people. Through teaching, advising and cheering them on—whether on the field, in the classroom, on the stage or in the biology labs—some of my very best Stanford experiences involved my interactions with undergraduates.”
“I will never forget Donald Kennedy getting up on the lab table at the front of the lecture hall and assuming a quadruped position to demonstrate to us the concepts of dorsal, ventral, cephalo, and caudal,” says Ingrid Schwontes Jackoway, a 1979 graduate of Stanford, in The Program in Human Biology at Stanford: The First 30 Years, 1971-2001, states the press release. In 1976, Kennedy received Stanford’s Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding Service to Undergraduate Education.
Kennedy took a leave of absence from Stanford in 1977 to serve as commissioner of the FDA under President Jimmy Carter, believing that scientists should work in government alongside other academics, according to the statement. He returned to Stanford as provost in 1979 and a year later assumed the role of president.
During his tenure as president, Kennedy navigated a controversial dispute with the federal government over reimbursement for indirect research costs, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and student sit-ins during the South African divestment movement in the mid-1980s, the release states. He stepped down from the office in 1992 and five years later published Academic Duty, a book about the challenges of teaching and research in higher education. 
Writing in his memoir about Science magazine’s editorial page, Kennedy recalls having “the opportunity to express my views on more than a hundred occasions, writing opinion pieces on such areas of science and policy as dual-use . . .  government secrecy, bioengineering, stem cell research, and climate change that I continue to find most compelling and in need of attention,” the statement says.
Kennedy was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1972 and was on the national advisory board of the Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. He was also on the board of directors of QuestBridge, a nonprofit that creates opportunities at leading higher education institutions for low-income students, and the Supporters of Agricultural Research Foundation, and was co-chair of the Committee on Science, Technology, and Law of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, according to the statement. Additionally, he served as a scientific advisor to PBS NewsHour.
Kennedy is survived by his wife, four children and their spouses, and nine grandchildren.
First US COVID-19 Deaths Happened Weeks Earlier than Thought/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM,

A
utopsy reports from Santa Clara County in California have adjusted estimates of the first US fatality from COVID-19 by several weeks. The reports’ findings, announced yesterday (April 21) by the Santa Clara County Department of Public Health, show that one of the county’s residents died at home from COVID-19 on February 6—long before the first US fatality from the disease was reported near Seattle on February 29.
Further autopsies identified COVID-19 in another two people who died in the county on February 17 and March 6. Santa Clara declared its first fatality on March 9.
“This wasn’t recognized because we were having a severe flu season,” Jeff Smith, a physician and the chief executive of Santa Clara County government, tells The Los Angeles Times. “Symptoms are very much like the flu. If you got a mild case of COVID, you didn’t really notice. You didn’t even go to the doctor. The doctor maybe didn’t even do [diagnostics] because they presumed it was the flu.”
As of this morning, the California Department of Public Health has reported more than 33,000 cases and 1,250 deaths statewide. Scientists, politicians, and members of the public have raised concerns over the last few weeks that official statistics underestimate the true number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in part due to limited testing early in the US outbreak.
See “Watch the Spread of COVID-19”
“Testing criteria set by the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,” reads the announcement on the county’s public health website. “As the Medical Examiner-Coroner continues to carefully investigate deaths throughout the county, we anticipate additional deaths from COVID-19 will be identified.”
The findings from the autopsies are “very significant,” Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, tells CNN. “Somebody who died on February 6, they probably contracted that virus early to mid-January,” he adds. It could mean that “there was community spread happening in California as early as mid-January, if not earlier than that. . . . We really need to now go back, look at a lot more cases from January—even December—and try to sort out when did we first really encounter this virus in the United States.”
See “Coronavirus’s Genetics Hint at its Cryptic Spread in Communities”
The CDC acknowledged in a statement updated today that many deaths due to COVID-19 may have been misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of proper testing. Reported deaths due to pneumonia spiked in March in several states, including Florida, New York, and Washington—a trend that has long been recognized by public health experts as signs that COVID-19 was already spreading undetected in the large parts of the US population.
Speaking to The New York Times in early April, Geraldine Ménard, the chief of general internal medicine at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, said that staff had recorded “a ton of patients with pneumonia” earlier in the year. “I remember thinking it was weird. I’m sure some of those patients did have it. But no one knew back then.”
BARDA Director Departs Post Overseeing COVID-19 Vaccine Efforts/-/ABOVE: Former BARDA Director Rick Bright (center) with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci (left) and Marilyn Serafini, former president and co-CEO of the Alliance for Health Reform
WIKIMEDIA, ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH POLICY
Update (May 8): Rick Bright’s lawyers announced that the federal agency investigating his removal from the position of BARDA director has uncovered evidence that the Trump administration retaliated against Bright, The New York Times reports. The lawyers added that the agency recommends Bright be reinstated pending the outcome of the investigation. “It will now be up to the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, to decide whether to let the special counsel investigate and send Dr. Bright back to B.A.R.D.A.,” the Times states.
Update (May 5): Rick Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), pressured him to issue an emergency use authorization for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment and that his public comments about the drug’s risks may have contributed to his termination as BARDA director, STAT reports. Both the House and Senate had previously requested that HHS look into Bright’s employment transfer, CNN reports.
Update (April 23): Rick Bright said in a statement on Wednesday (April 22) that he thinks he was removed as BARDA director because he had pushed for more research on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that President Donald Trump and others have touted as a promising coronavirus treatment despite only weak evidence so far, The New York Times reports. “I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” Bright writes in his statement. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science — not politics or cronyism — has to lead the way.”
T
he government agency that has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates is undergoing a change of leadership, STAT reported yesterday (April 21). Rick Bright, who has led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) since 2016, is stepping down as director and will be taking a position at the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus testing platforms. Former Deputy Director Gary Disbrow will replace Bright as acting director of BARDA.
See “US Selects Two COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates for Huge Investments”
BARDA has partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, which launched a clinical trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine last month, and with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, which is expected to start human testing in a few months. In the most recent coronavirus stimulus package, BARDA will receive another $1 billion for COVID-19-related work, according to The Hill.
See “Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Vaccine Begins in Seattle”
The reason for the personnel change is unclear. Some officials tell STAT that Bright had some conflict with Bob Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the person to whom Bright reported.
“Dr. Rick Bright will transfer the skills he has applied as Director of the [BARDA] to the [NIH],” an HHS spokesperson tells STAT. “Dr. Bright brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public-private partnerships that advance the health and well-being of the American people.”

Microbiologist Who Studied Deadly Bacteria in Public Places Dies/-/ABOVE: LONDON METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY
P
aul Matewele, a microbiologist who identified pathogenic bacteria on surfaces that humans contact everyday, died as a result of COVID-19 on April 7 at the age of 62. 
Matewele was a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University for 30 years and is best known for his work characterizing potentially pathogenic microbes that people are likely to come in contact with in their homes and public places, according to Úna Fairbrother, an interim head of the School of Human Sciences at London Metropolitan University.
Matewele was born in Zimbabwe in 1958 and earned a master’s degree in biochemistry from St. Andrews University and a PhD in microbiology from Southampton University.
Partially inspired by the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance, Matewele conducted studies identifying sometimes-deadly microbes living on handbags, McDonald’s touch screens, reusable water bottles, makeup, vehicle air conditioners, drinks served in cinemas, London transport systems, and coins. His work on the London transportation system led to a deep cleaning of 50 stations in the London Underground in June 2017.
But among colleagues, he was best known for the time he spent lecturing and tutoring thousands of students. “Paul was a warm, kind, intelligent and conscientious man. He was dedicated to his students and a brilliant colleague to have,” Fairbrother tells The Scientist in an email. “He was a genuinely happy, open person and will be much missed from our team on a personal and professional level.”
Several of Matewele’s students and colleagues shared thoughts and memories in a tribute on the university’s webpage describing him as a “dedicated teacher,” “a kind soul,” and someone who “never stopped smiling.”
Sean Frost, a former colleague of Matawele who is currently a lecturer at the University of Hull, writes on the university page that Matewele “took on the biggest challenges and was never afraid to fight for what he believed in, McDonalds being particularly memorable. Even up until March he was broadcasting warnings about risk of infection from cash, Paul always took the side of the little guy, be it colleagues, students or society. He was a fine example of what an academic should aspire to become.”
Matawele is survived by his 18-year-old son, William. 
False Negatives in Quick COVID-19 Test Near 15 Percent: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SOUTH_AGENCY
A
s the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues with global cases nearing 2.5 million, clinicians have raised questions about the accuracy of available COVID-19 tests. After in-house testing of different available tests, one physician found that Abbott’s assay using its ID NOW device, which can provide results in 5–13 minutes, has a false-negative rate that nears 15 percent. The full results, first reported by NPR, have not been published or peer-reviewed.
Gary Procop is the chairman of the commission of science, technology and policy for the American Society for Clinical Pathology, and is currently heading up COVID-19 testing at Cleveland Clinic. He and his team took 239 patient samples known to be positive for the virus and re-tested them using five products available through the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) emergency use authorization. The test that turned out to be the least accurate is the one known for its speed.
The ID NOW machine was granted emergency use approval during the pandemic on March 27 and generated buzz after President Donald Trump unveiled it during a press conference. In Procop’s analysis, Abbott’s test had a false-negative rate of 14.8 percent. 
“So that means if you had 100 patients that were positive, 15 percent of those patients would be falsely called negative. They’d be told that they’re negative for COVID when they’re really positive. That’s not too good,” Procop tells NPR, adding that, ideally, test reliability should be above 95 percent.
The DiaSorin Simplexa test had a false-negative rate of around 11 percent. Tests developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cepheid, and Roche had false-negative rates of 0, 1.8, and 3.5 percent, respectively.
In the wake of the study’s results, Procop’s facility is no longer using the Abbott test, and he is not the only administrator to make that decision.
Alan Wells, a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, tells STAT that his facility is not using the test anymore because the viral load of the patient might play a role with testing accuracy, more readily identifying those with higher levels. “However, with lower loads of virus, a large fraction of these patients were not detected as positive,” he says.
STAT also reports that Emily Miller, an OB-GYN at Northwestern University, referred to the test as “clinically not useful” to identify the virus in expectant mothers.
According to NPR, Abbott disagrees with Procop’s findings, stating that any errors might come from the use of viral transport media, which is commonplace in testing and helps extend the shelf life of the sample. All of the samples in Procop’s study used this media rather than testing directly from the nasal swab. Abbott has sent letters to the healthcare facilities that have received some of the 600,000 tests, advising them to test directly with the swab, which yields the most reliable results.
Because the FDA cleared the test for use directly with the swabs as well as with transport media, Procop tells NPR that he wants additional clarification on the accuracy of the test, because of the more significant implications of false-negative results.
Due to the nature of this novel coronavirus, manufacturers have had to scramble to not only develop tests capable of detecting the virus but also mass produce them and get them into the hands of frontline healthcare workers quickly. The urgency of the situation has also caused the FDA to grant the tests approval under emergency use authorization, which foregoes much of the rigorous testing that would ordinarily be required.
“It is a risk that if you tell somebody they’re negative and they’re truly positive that they will relax social distancing, not wear a face mask, etc., and could transmit the disease,” Procop tells NPR. “If you get back a negative test and think, ‘I don’t have it and I can go to a mixer,’ and now everybody at the mixer has now been exposed to you.”
Additionally, Procop explains, patients admitted to the hospital for unrelated reasons might still be carrying the virus. If they are incorrectly determined not to have the virus, they could pose a risk to other patients in non-COVID wings, furthering the spread of the virus.
Could Curbing Runaway Immune Responses Treat COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SAKKMESTERKE
A
mong the many outstanding questions about COVID-19 is how the same virus, SARS-CoV-2, can kill some patients and leave others unaware they were ever exposed. Clinical evidence combined with hints from laboratory research indicate that for at least some patients with severe cases, the primary danger comes from a runaway immune response that irreparably injures tissue, researchers say. Understanding the mechanisms behind that response could be key to finding a treatment for those patients.
It appears that after infection, the virus replicates itself inside a patient, leading to a disease phase where the immune system mounts an inflammatory response against the invader, says Charles Dela Cruz, a pulmonologist at Yale School of Medicine who is researching COVID-19. Then, in those patients who progress to severe disease, “potentially this inflammatory response is too much and hyper-inflames, causing a lot of side effects in terms of tissue damage and organ failure and things like that,” he says. 
That picture is backed up by early clinical reports that find elevated levels of biomarkers associated with inflammation, such as C-reactive protein. Some studies suggest certain patients with severe disease experience what’s known as cytokine release syndrome, or a cytokine storm, meaning their immune cells ramp up the production of inflammation-driving cytokines to dangerously high levels. 
In a preprint posted in February, for example, researchers in Guangzhou, China, reported that eight of 11 COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome had hallmarks of cytokine release syndrome, including fever, an increase in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells, and elevated levels of the cytokine IL-6. Similarly, a study of 150 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan found that those who died had significantly higher IL-6 levels than did those who were later released from the hospital. The authors suggest “cytokine storm syndrome” as a possible cause of death from the disease.
“Cytokine storm syndrome is this kind of an umbrella term for a variety of [physiological phenomena] named by different types of physicians for different types of diseases,” explains Randy Cron, a rheumatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham whose research focuses on the phenomenon. For example, cytokine storms are known as macrophage activation syndrome when they occur as a result of inflammatory diseases, and cytokine release syndrome when they stem from CAR T cell therapy for leukemia. 
In general, the onslaught of cytokines causes blood vessels to leak, allowing immune cells to get into organs, potentially driving organ failure. Cytokine storms can also cause blood clotting. In influenza infections, cytokine storms are also tied to abberrant glucose metabolism, researchers reported recently based on experiments in mice. 
Doctors and researchers are scrambling to find therapies to stop the cytokine onslaught.
Cron suspects that the answer to why some patients with COVID-19 develop cytokine storms while others don’t may be partly genetic. His own past research has identified genes that cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a rare autoimmune disease involving cytokine storms, when a person inherits two mutated copies. In analyses of patients’ genes and work with cultured cells, he says, his group has found indications that just one mutated copy could cause macrophage activation syndrome if cells are exposed to a trigger such as an infection. He doesn’t know of any current effort to look for such mutations in COVID-19 patients, but expects they will happen eventually. Some studies looking broadly for genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity are already underway. 
In the meantime, doctors and researchers are scrambling to find therapies to stop the cytokine onslaught. One possibility is tocilizumab, an antibody that binds to receptors for IL-6, inhibiting that cytokine’s action. A recent case report from France found that two doses of the drug were associated with a marked improvement in symptoms of one COVID-19 patient, and trials of tocilizumab for the disease are happening now in multiple countries. 
Another possibility is anakinra, a drug for rheumatoid arthritis and a condition known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease that blocks receptors for the cytokine IL-1. Along with other drugs, anakinra is now being trialed as a COVID-19 treatment in separate studies in Greece, Belgium, and Italy. Baricitinib, a drug for rheumatoid arthritis that blocks enzymes that lead to cytokine release, is another drug for which multiple trials are planned.
Dousing the flames of fiery cell death
As clinicians try existing cytokine-blocking drugs against COVID-19, other researchers are looking for potential targets that would head off cytokine storms before they begin, says Dela Cruz. One candidate is a process known as pyroptosis (Greek for “fiery falling”), a form of cell death that often occurs as a result of infection and spurs cytokine production. 
Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale who sometimes collaborates with Dela Cruz, says the heightened levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) some studies have reported in the blood of COVID-19 patients points toward pyroptosis as core to the disease. LDH is an enzyme common in the body that converts lactate to pyruvate and is released from cells during pyroptosis, or from tissue damage in general. In addition, she says, pyroptosis would explain elevated levels of two cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, that have been associated with severe cases. “I’m just thinking this kind of smoldering, fiery death that’s happening inside the person is initiating the downstream cascade . . . that leads to [a] cytokine storm,” she says.
Unlike apoptosis, in which cells typically die quietly without inciting an immune response, pyroptosis is distinguished by the activation of protein complexes known as inflammasomes by pathogens, says Kate Fitzgerald, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center who studies inflammasomes. That activation sets off a chain of events that includes processing of IL-1 and other cytokines for release from the cell, and the formation of pores in the cell membrane that let out “danger signals” such as the cytokines and LDH. Eventually, the cell ruptures and dies. “It’s thought that this pyroptotic cell death is particularly important for exposing intracellular niches of bacteria,” she says, allowing those bacteria to be destroyed. 
Based on the clinical evidence she’s seen, Fitzgerald says she thinks it may well be the case that pyroptosis gone awry could help explain severe COVID-19 cases, but it’s not yet proven. LDH, she notes, seems to be a nonspecific marker of tissue damage, so may not by itself point to pyroptosis. But inflammasome activation has been found during infections from other RNA viruses, such as influenza, and overall, “I think there’s a really good rationale to think that these pathways could be dysregulated in this disease,” she says.
Another piece of evidence that may point to pyroptosis in severe cases of COVID-19 comes from previous work on SARS-CoV-2’s close relative SARS-CoV, the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. Two years ago, John Kehrl’s group at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases reported that a genetic region called open reading frame 3a is critical for SARS-CoV’s ability to kill mice, and that the protein it codes for triggers the assembly of a type of inflammasome known as NLRP3, indicating that the protein may induce pyroptosis. 
Working in shifts, one person to a room, his team is now working to understand SARS-CoV-2’s arsenal, including whether the protein from its open reading frame 3a acts in the same way as SARS-CoV’s does. “We would be surprised if it’s not doing many of the same things [in SARS-CoV-2] that that open reading frame did in the SARS virus,” he says. “But we obviously want to test that.”
There is an existing drug, disulfiram, that’s thought to inhibit the pore formation that occurs during pyroptosis. Although its approved use is to curb alcohol abuse, it’s also shown up in screens for drugs that could inhibit a key SARS-CoV-2 protein, and it’s been proposed for use in COVID-19 clinical trials. In addition, Fitzgerald notes, several companies have been developing inhibitors of the inflammasome NLRP3 with the goal of halting aberrant pyroptosis in other conditions, and she expects such drugs will be tried for COVID-19. “When you have too much production of inflammatory mediators, that leads to tissue damage, damage to the lung in particular,” she says. “And maybe if you can reverse that with patients who were really in these more severe stages of disease, you could improve their outcomes.”
Furloughs and Pay Cuts Announced for U of Arizona Employees/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WELLESENTERPRISES
F
aculty and staff at the University of Arizona will be subject to temporary furloughs and pay cuts through June 30, 2021 due to the financial strains of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a statement released by the university’s department of human resources on Friday (April 17). Like many institutions, the university had previously moved all spring classes online and canceled or rescheduled its events. It is also weathering increased technology costs and a projected decline in tuition revenue. The press release states that the changes in employee compensation, set to begin on May 11, are necessary because of an “extreme financial crisis resulting from the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The furlough program for 2020 and 2021 will be implemented based on salary range. Employees who earn up to $44,499 will take 13 furlough days totaling 104 hours; those who earn between $44,500 and $75,000 will take 26 furlough days totaling 208 hours; and employees earning between $75,000 and $150,000 will take 39 furlough days totaling 312 hours, the press release states. Equivalent pay reductions are 5 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. 
In lieu of furloughs, highly-compensated employees will have their pay reduced. Those earning between $150,000 and $199,999 will receive a 17 percent reduction, while those earning over $200,000 will receive a 20 percent reduction in pay.
According to Career Onestop, the University of Arizona is the state’s largest employer with nearly 15,000 workers, reports KGUN 9 in Tucson.
University president Robert Robbins confirmed in an email that employees would keep all benefits throughout the furlough and pay cut period, including health insurance.
Models predict a $250 million loss in the university’s budget due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he writes, with $66 million lost by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.
Robbins said during a conference call on Wednesday that “40% of our students are from outside of Arizona, and about 15% of those are international students,” reports Tucson.com. “Our net tuition revenue is derived greatly from out-of-state and international students,” he said, “so we’re going to have significant shortfalls in the projections of what we’re going to have from tuition revenue.”
Pam Scott, University of Arizona spokeswoman, tells AZ Central that the university has issued “substantial” refunds for housing, meals, and parking, and that other revenue sources have been “severely reduced,” including recreation centers, bookstores, and ticketed events. The technology expenses associated with moving 45,000 students to online learning have further strained the budget, according to Scott, as have cleaning expenses during the pandemic.
The employee compensation measures, applied during a 15-month period, are intended to save $93 million, according to Robbins’ email, a figure that covers less than 40 percent of the shortfall projected through June 30, 2021. 
The university has also issued a hiring freeze and delayed plans for merit increases, which is projected to save $26 million, the email states. Robbins and other senior vice presidents took pay cuts in March, he writes, and the university is scaling back new construction and FY20 strategic plan funding, with a projected savings of $29 million.

CDC Lab Contamination Delayed Coronavirus Testing/-/ABOVE:  © ISTOCK.COM, SELIMAKSAN
T
he US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention violated its own manufacturing standards, which led to contamination of the country’s first coronavirus tests, rendering them ineffective, The Washington Post reported Saturday (April 18). 
Problems with the tests were reported not long after the first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was announced in late January in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent Timothy Stenzel, the agency’s director of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health, to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta to identify the source of the problem.
According to The New York Times, Stenzel found that no one was in charge of the entire test-manufacturing process, and those working on the tests didn’t have much expertise in commercial manufacturing. He also observed several opportunities for contamination, including test kit assembly in the same room with coronavirus material.
The CDC made its test in a lab, rather than in its manufacturing facilities, an FDA spokesperson tells CNN. “CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol.”
The part of the test exposed to contamination was not necessary for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the Post reports. Yet, it took several weeks to eliminate that part from the kits, adding to delays in testing across the country. 
Many federal officials, including CDC Director Robert Redfield, have said that contamination in the agency’s labs might have been what made the tests ineffective. A spokesperson for the agency told the Times that contamination was a just possibility, then provided a statement that “C.D.C. implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing the issue moving forward.”
Even with improved tests from the CDC, and now from other commercial companies as well, availability is still limited. Testing is not yet widespread enough to reopen the country, health experts tell the Times.

s COVID-19 spread in the US and test kits were in short supply, several hospitals reached out to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in search of viral transport solution, which “ensure[s] that the virus collected from patients doesn’t break down before we’re able to test it,” explains Michael Daley of the university’s Cell Culture Core Facility in a video.
Researchers there sprung into action. Barbara Osborne, an immunologist in the department of veterinary and animal sciences, said she had stockpiles of the needed media, Daley explains in the video. Daley’s lab had a number of the reagents, and after they recruited a few other labs, it took them only a week to make a batch of the solution, test it, and distribute it to local hospitals.
The process has now been streamlined, Daley says in the video, and Osborne tells The Scientist in an email that they made 12,000 tubes last week and further increased their production this week.

N95 Respirators Can Be Decontaminated from SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JOE CICAK
A
mid a worldwide shortage of N95 respirators that help protect healthcare workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new study conducted by federal scientists found that the masks can be effectively decontaminated from SARS-CoV-2 exposure and reused up to three times. While the research, published on April 15, has not been peer-reviewed, it offers multiple methods for extending the life of N95 respirators, which are designed for single use.          
Coauthor Vincent Munster of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases tells The New York Times that the research relied upon more than a decade of studies on decontamination. “We showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,” and is also effective against bacteria, he says.
The investigators tested different decontamination methods on small sections of filter fabric from N95 respirators that had been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), 70 °C dry heat, ultraviolet light, and 70 percent ethanol spray, according to a press release. While all four methods were found to eliminate the virus, the authors concluded that the VHP method was most effective because it required only a 10-minute treatment, while UV and dry heat require at least 60-minute treatments.
Volunteer employees wore clean respirators that had been decontaminated with all four methods in order to test whether the masks maintained a proper fit and seal over the face, which is crucial for reducing exposure to airborne pathogens. Ethanol damaged the mask after two decontamination sessions, and for that reason is not recommended by the authors, according to the statement.
Even if the decontamination was successful but the mask fit was compromised, Munster tells the Times, “then obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.”
UV and dry heat–treated masks held up for two cycles of decontamination but began to fail after three, suggesting that they could potentially be reused twice. VHP–treated masks were unaffected, which means they may possibly be used three times. 
“Vaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that’s available,” Munster tells the Times. Nursing homes may not have access to VPH, he says, but the dry heat procedure could basically be carried out in an oven. 
Lynn Goldman of George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health says in remarks to the Times that the new study is an “excellent contribution” and that it’s “helpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.”
Another preprint published by researchers in Canada on April 8 found that masks of varying brands were still effective after 10 rounds of VHP decontamination, reports the Times.
The US Food and Drug Administration had previously issued emergency use authorizations for a number of mask decontamination methods, including one VHP system that could potentially decontaminate 4 million masks per day, reports Healio, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published guidelines on both extended use and limited reuse of N95 respirators.
On April 13, the Pentagon announced a $415 million contract for 60 units of the Battelle Decontamination System, each of which can decontaminate up to 80,000 respirators per day. 
DNA Could Hold Clues to Varying Severity of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KRUIUA

mong the many mysteries that remain about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is why it hits some people harder than others. Millions of people have been infected, but many never get sick. Those who do can experience an ever-expanding array of symptoms, including loss of smell or taste, pink eye, digestive issues, fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Although the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, and men are most likely to suffer severe complications, hundreds of young and previously healthy people have died from the disease in the US alone.
In recent weeks, researchers have begun asking whether genetics could influence the severity of symptoms. 
So far, they know “basically nothing,” Wendy Chung, a clinical geneticist and physician at Columbia University, tells The Scientist. She is one of hundreds of scientists launching studies to interrogate the human genome for answers. Chung and her team are racing to “recycle” and bank nasal swabs and other clinical samples from COVID-19 patients across the New York-Presbyterian Hospital System, currently in the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.  
The researchers plan to extract the patients’ DNA and scan the genomes for tiny sequence variations associated with symptoms listed in their electronic health records. 
Prior research has uncovered gene variants that can alter a person’s chances of contracting an infectious disease. The most famous example is a mutation in the CCR5 gene, which offers protection against HIV. 
Other variants can affect what happens once the virus is inside the human body, leading to strikingly disparate outcomes from one person to the next, says Priya Duggal, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University. Duggal has previously shown that variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which influence the body’s immune response, may explain why some people spontaneously clear hepatitis C infection whereas others are left with chronic disease. 
Duggal says understanding how genetic background affects people’s responses to infection may give scientists proteins or pathways to target to boost the immune response with a vaccine. That’s the reason she recently expanded her lab’s research from HIV, hepatitis, and other pathogens to look at the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. She is planning a study of younger people who have been hospitalized after contracting the virus to see if there is a genetic basis for their more serious disease, though she hesitates to guess what might come up in her search. 
“I think we’re so bad at predicting [which genes matter]. We’ve been terrible in the past and I think a lot of it is because we don’t fully understand everything that’s going on in the immune system,” she says. One of the reasons COVID-19 can be so fatal to some people is because of their bodies elicit an overzealous immune response called a cytokine storm, which may originate in their DNA. A small study of patients who died from the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak found that many carried mutations that triggered this self-destructive flood of cytokine molecules.
Results from studies on the genetics of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are beginning to trickle in. One study suggests that variants in the HLA genes likely play a role. Others point to differences in the ABO blood type, as well as variants in the ACE2 gene, which codes for the protein SARS-CoV-2 latches onto to infect human cells. But the findings are all preliminary, and require follow-up with larger datasets.
See “Why Some COVID-19 Cases Are Worse than Others”
Andrea Ganna, a biostatistician at the University of Helsinki, is leading a major effort to pool data from genomics projects around the globe. The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative includes 117 studies on its website, and more than 439 scientists on its Slack channel. Ganna says several big biobanks have agreed to share the DNA data they have been gathering since before the pandemic, including the Penn Medicine Biobank, which has 60,000 participants; FinnGen, which has collected DNA from 5 percent of Finland’s entire population; and the UK Biobank, one of the world’s largest with samples from 500,000 volunteers. 
“I’m quite confident when these big players come on board, we can grow our databases exponentially in the next month and that we will find something,” says Ganna, who is hoping to identify gene variants associated with COVID-19 outcomes. 
Earlier this month, the personal genomics company 23andMe announced it would be tapping its database of more than 10 million customers for clues. Joyce Tung, 23andMe’s vice president of research, says her group plans to roll out surveys to the more than 80 percent of customers who have consented to be part of research. They hope to get hundreds of thousands of volunteers to enroll in the study, which will ask questions about their social distancing measures, symptoms, and COVID-19 test results. 
Unique challenges of collecting genomic data during the pandemic
Every new positive case of COVID-19 provides another valuable data point for genomic studies. But if the pandemic wanes significantly, it is possible some studies may never be completed. “In some ways we’re playing a weird game, because the best scenario would be if we can’t get enough data because there weren’t enough cases,” says Tung.    
For now, the rapidly moving nature of the pandemic, and the infection itself, poses unique challenges. For their study, Chung’s and her colleagues have already identified thousands of positive cases, which they are consenting remotely. Several times, coordinators have called potential study subjects after they’ve been discharged, only to find out they’ve died. 
Chung, who pivoted her own work on rare diseases to contribute to COVID-19 research, says she feels a tremendous sense of urgency. “We think about what we can learn in two weeks, not what we can learn in two years,” says Chung. “Literally, my teams are working seven days a week, 16 hours a day.”
The same issue that has hampered efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus—the lack of widespread testing—is also complicating research to understand its biology. For instance, just this week, New York City added more than 3,700 people to its death toll who were presumed to have died of the coronavirus but had never tested positive. “If we don’t have widespread testing, then I can’t rely on that to tell me that someone was positive or not,” says Duggal. 
If scientists are successful in identifying genes that presage the infection’s most devastating effects, they could more effectively triage the patients who need medical attention. If they get lucky, they might even uncover genes that make some people resistant, granting them the return to normalcy that so many people crave. So far, there’s no evidence for this. 
“I’m not convinced this is going to be the last one of these infectious disease crises,” Chung says. “I think what we’re trying to do is learn what we can for this one condition . . . and gain a better understanding of the immune response and generally how we fight infections.”
With Humans Indoors, Animals Go Wild/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ANNASALLING
A
s humans are remaining indoors in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it appears that wildlife around the world took notice of our absence. There seems to be a never-ending list of animals becoming emboldened during this time to explore areas that are typically heavily populated: Buffalo have taken to the deserted highways in India. Mountain lions have rested in trees in Boulder, Colorado. Wild boar walk the streets of Barcelona while peacocks strut along open streets in Brazil. 
Rats in New York City have somehow become even more confident in their quest for food. And a groundhog appeared to stare down two dogs watching through a window while eating a piece of pizza, which probably doesn’t have anything to do with the lockdown, but was a welcome distraction on social media nonetheless.
The Washington Post reports that a tribe of goats overtook the streets of Wales. Video taken by resident Andrew Stuart shows the animals nonchalantly roaming the empty streets and helping themselves to a meal of hedges and flower gardens. 
Goats take to the streets of Wales during lockdown.
THE GUARDIAN
According to SFGate, an employee from Yosemite National Park claims that since the park closed to the public in late March, the sightings of large animals including bears, bobcats, and coyotes have gone up fourfold. 
“It’s not like [bears] aren’t usually here,” Yosemite employee Dane Peterson tells SFGate, “it’s that they usually hang back at the edges, or move in the shadows.”
In Mexico, crocodiles that generally stay hidden in lagoons near the beaches in La Ventanilla, Oaxaca, have been coming out in the open since the beaches were closed to the public about two weeks ago, Mexico News Daily reports.
Endangered sea turtles have also taken advantage of empty beaches to nest in Brazil and Florida. It’s too early to tell how lockdown measures will affect sea turtle numbers when it is time for the eggs to hatch. Decreased traffic could create less artificial light to confuse the hatchlings about which direction to go, Shanon Gann, the program manager at Brevard Zoo Sea Turtle Healing Center in Florida, tells weather.com.
A mixed bag for animals that depend on humans
In urban areas where wildlife is, for better or worse, dependent on human activity, the lockdown brings new challenges. The New York Times describes scenes in Thailand, where macaques have come to rely on humans for food. Their populations have become so dense in these areas because of that food supply that people staying home has quickly created a scarcity of resources, leading to aggressive behavior. 
The same goes for duck ponds, ecologist Becky Thomas of Royal Holloway in London writes for The Conversation. Although feeding bread to ducks is harmful to their health and the water around them, there will be an adjustment as they compete for healthier resources. 
Thomas notes that decreased traffic will lead to less hedgehog roadkill as well as reduced noise pollution that negatively affects the ability of bats, birds, and other animals to communicate.
See "EPA Protections Relaxed During Coronavirus Pandemic"
The lack of human presence hasn’t benefited all animals, as the Times reports, particularly animals in African nature preserves. With fewer tourists around, poachers are killing rhinos with an increased frequency in Botswana and South Africa. 
“We’re in a situation of zero income, and our expenses are actually going up all the time just trying to fight off the poachers and protect the reserve,” Lynne MacTavish, operations manager at Mankwe Wildlife Reserve in South Africa, tells the Times. “To say it’s desperate is an understatement. We’re really in crisis here.”
Some of the earliest widely shared reports of wildlife emerging in populated areas turned out to be false, according to National Geographic’s debunking of some of the more common untruths. One such tale says baby elephants in China got drunk on corn wine and passed out in a tea field, which might be very relatable during these times, but never happened. The absence of boats in the canals of Venice brought claims of dolphins appearing for the first time in decades, but the images were from the island of Sardinia, nearly 500 miles away. 
There may not be dolphins in Venice, but the waters have gotten astonishingly clear, as the lack of gondolas and other boats on the water haven’t been stirring up sediment, CNBC reports.
Right now, it isn’t clear what the long-term effects of this lockdown will be on nature, primarily because this is occurring when many species in the Northern Hemisphere are mating, giving birth, or coming out of hibernation. Air pollution in some areas has been cut in half since the lockdowns began, Forbes reports, due to the lack of emissions from vehicles and factories. Some cities notorious for smoggy skies, including Los Angeles and Beijing, are enjoying some of the cleanest air they’ve experienced in decades. While the tolls of air pollution on human health are widely known, animals are also at risk, according to the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
As many are still sheltering-in-places as we approach the 50th annual Earth Day, this resurgence of wildlife is giving some cause for hope that this evidence will ultimately lead to better policies to protect the environment and create a new normal.
“I am hopeful,” anthropologist Jane Goodall tells the Post. “I am. I lived through World War II. By the time you get to 86, you realize that we can overcome these things. One day we will be better people, more responsible in our attitudes toward nature.”
Opinion: Public Health Trumps Privacy in a Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, HENADZI PECHAN
W
e propose an “ethical precautionary principle” in response to how governments should restart the economy from this pandemic. We define an ethical precautionary principle as a strategy used when approaching potential ethical harm under conditions where extensive scientific knowledge and data are lacking. In this situation, we propose an antibody certification process to identify those individuals who could safely return to work even though this process may violate ethical rights of privacy and confidentiality. Those with low or no titers of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will not be allowed to return to work until there is herd immunity or they are vaccinated.
Presumably, there will be extensive diagnostic testing of our population to establish who has sufficient protective antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. In the short term, an in vitro test that measures neutralizing anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be sufficient to estimate what levels of antibody titers are protective. Measuring neutralizing antibodies in patients takes time and is expensive. Therefore, we can assume, like with measles titer diagnostics, that people who exhibit high levels of polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will also have sufficient neutralizing antibodies. The medical challenge here is to develop a standardized antibody titer test that is accessible to all and is scientifically accurate. This will take months to develop.
We advocate for antibody identification and certification using a voluntary app with the understanding and acceptance that we give up some of our rights to privacy.
As our nation starts to ease quarantines and stimulates the economy, we face ethical threats to valued rights of privacy and confidentiality. Privacy refers to the individual’s ability to control personal information that belongs solely to that individual. Confidentiality is the obligation that professionals owe to the individual to maintain and protect their information. The right to privacy is a highly protected ethical mandate that is used in many landmark decisions, such as patient-physician relationships (HIPAA) and Roe v. Wade. How then do privacy rights apply to the COVID-19 crisis? How would society enforce that only antibody-protected workers can return to the workplace?
Technology such as contact tracking can be extended to include the identification of antibody-protected individuals. (Contact tracing, in contrast, is an invasive process that involves identifying and following all contacts of an exposed or infected person.) Antibody positive or negative test results could be linked to cell phones via an app that can be tracked. One could envision that employers could gain access to this information to ensure that only protected workers who are ID-tagged can return to their jobs. Now, the question is, should this information also be accessible to the general public? For example, before entering a supermarket, one could check whether this public area is a “safe” zone (that is, all the people alongside you are immune) or an unsafe danger zone, where there are people nearby who have no antibody certificate or who are antibody negative.
See “What Do Antibody Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?”
Does revealing antibody protection information violate personal privacy issues? Is knowing that your co-worker and a neighbor do not have high anti–SARS-CoV-2 titers infringe on their privacy? The duty to maintain confidentiality is not absolute and can be loosened under circumscribed conditions, such as when protecting one person’s confidentiality endangers another’s welfare or public health.
Decisions to breach confidentiality must be tempered by restraint in public health ethics. Health providers and government officials should always employ the least invasive, least coercive means necessary to achieve a vital public health goal. In general, we believe that diminishing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a vital health objective that should trump respecting privacy and confidentiality, if necessary.
It must be noted that minority populations are less likely to be antibody tested, even if they contracted SARS-CoV-2 and were symptomatic, because there are limitations and barriers to their access to testing. It will be unfortunate and an unintended consequence if minorities will not have the documentation that allows them to return to work. This will further exacerbate the disparities confronting our society. It is unethical to create a two-tiered society of the haves and have nots. People will accept the privacy right infringement if there is equal access to testing for all.
We are not advocating contact tracing for COVID-19, though it is of proven benefit for mitigating the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola, because it is much more invasive of privacy rights. Rather, we advocate for antibody identification and certification using a voluntary app with the understanding and acceptance that we give up some of our rights to privacy.
In fact, our annual flu vaccination protocols also involve giving up some of our rights to privacy. At major hospitals around the country, hospital workers are usually mandated to receive yearly flu vaccinations and on each of their ID badges a sticker is placed indicating that they have been vaccinated. Those who choose not to be vaccinated are required to wear protective masks when entering the hospital. Moreover, many airports use temperature monitoring systems to screen passengers who may carry a transmittable flu-like disease.
The proposed concept of an “ethical precautionary principle” is not a panacea. Given our current crisis, the ethical precautionary principle allows us to violate certain ethical principles such as privacy and confidentiality to facilitate our ability to return to some degree of economic and social stability before a COVID-19 vaccine is in place.
Making a special case for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers to be openly accessible might induce additional anxiety among our citizens. Therefore, it is critical that public health officials and political leaders provide a transparent, well-supported rationale for antibody testing as we enter the recovery stage of COVID-19. In this crisis, our precautionary principle states that the need to promote the general physical, mental, and economic health of society outweighs the valued ethical rights to protect privacy and maintain confidentiality.

Opinion: Redefining Productivity in the Age of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: The empty Jarvis lab on the day it closed
ERICH JARVIS
I
t is Wednesday afternoon, March 18, 2020, a beautiful day hinting at spring, the cherry blossoms beginning to bloom. The city that never sleeps is restless, with many of its 8.6 million residents either incredulous about the growing urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic or fully committed to preparing for quarantined life indoors, a seeming impossibility here where domestic life typically spills out onto front stoops and into city parks and crowded restaurants. In Manhattan, one sacrifice among the millions that residents are making unfolds. One of us (EDJ) tweets, “The first time I have to close my lab in 22 years. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting us all in many ways. Let’s all be part of the solution.” Our institution, the Rockefeller University, officially closed that day.
The decree by our university and city to shut down all non-essential operations became a necessary inevitability. The university leadership, like that of many other institutions, delivered a positive tone among the adversity in an email communication to the campus about its commitment to “protect and sustain our community with the goal of being as productive as possible while off-campus to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position to return to normal operations at the earliest opportunity.” But we soon discovered that the new normal of being as productive as possible from our homes with no laboratory was more of a challenge than we could imagine.
Our lab studies the neural and genetic mechanisms of vocal learning in species that can imitate sounds, such as songbirds and parrots, as a model for how humans learn spoken language. The most important aspect of temporarily shutting down with an abbreviated timeline of three days was to quickly and safely transition laboratory members to working remotely and to ensure the welfare of our research animals. Our lab manager, Samara Brown, in coordination with multiple administrative and resource departments, led the efforts to ensure the preservation and maintenance of unique reagents, animals, data, and critical and non-essential equipment.
This conflict between being productive in our scientific endeavors and surviving a global pandemic can lead to guilt and fear.
Many students, postdocs, and staff scientists transitioned their focus to the conceptualizing and analyzing aspects of science that are as relevant as the data collection itself, including accessing all data on university servers and in lab notebooks, running computer programs, and writing manuscripts for publication. Accessing data online was especially necessary for those who left the city to quarantine with family or friends in other towns of the United States or other countries. For students who had not yet collected enough data as well as rotation students, in addition to reading assignments, we tasked them to help others analyze data.
For the basic scientist, the bench is the foundation of our work. Pausing experiments for an indeterminate period of time, especially for projects that have been ongoing for months to years, is also a moratorium on one’s purpose. And no one was prepared for life in lockdown, given that the last worldwide viral pandemic of a similar magnitude, the 1917-1918 flu, was more than 100 years ago.
Four weeks after our laboratory closed and with no end date in sight, we find ourselves in the epicenter of this pandemic in the United States. Finding the balance between scholarly productivity and remaining sane while physically distancing in our homes is a daily, sometimes hourly, endeavor for most lab members. It is not surprising that the ability to concentrate on being scientifically productive is challenging given the constant news on COVID-19, the hundreds to thousands of people who are sick and dying on a daily basis in this city and elsewhere, the constant ambulance sirens, and the young children at home. Additionally, with working at home and no requirement to be in the lab, no work schedule accountability, and no bench experiments to conduct, it can be hard to find the motivation to do anything other than sleep and eat, and maybe exercise. Laboratory members want to be productive, but day-to-day activities under the cloud of COVID-19 can be overwhelming.
This conflict between being productive in our scientific endeavors and surviving a global pandemic can lead to guilt and fear. Some laboratory members feel aware of their tremendous encumbrance not only when their colleagues or classmates manage to submit a scientific paper for publication during the pandemic but also when scrolling down their Twitter feed to read about the great things Shakespeare and Newton accomplished during their respective pandemics. We feel it is expected that one will accomplish less of your normal work during a pandemic. But that does not mean we are idly standing by.
As scientists, we are receiving inquiries from friends and family, asking if reported new discoveries are real or fake. Not being experts in virology, but being trained in scientific thinking, we can at least give partially well-informed answers, but this can also feel burdensome. Finding a balance of normal work and informing those around us and the public is being productive.
Our ability to respond with meaningful participation in the local and worldwide efforts is also being productive.
Connecting virtually through the many available video conference platforms is also productive because it allows us to engage as we work from home, albeit requiring us to navigate a world of new social norms. How can we speak without interrupting? Is it rude to turn your video off so you can eat your lunch, run to the bathroom, have your child sit on your lap, or kiss a loved one goodbye? Is there an expected dress code? Additionally, the increasing intersection between professional and personal boundaries does not necessarily translate to an equally increasing desire to connect virtually, introducing another aspect of defining balance between work and home life.
One prevailing aspect that has been instrumental in retaining a sense of self and normalcy is redirecting our skills and resources to the pandemic; this is also productive. When local New York City hospitals put out an urgent call for supplies, members of our lab collected our disposable gloves, masks, gowns, and other personal protective equipment to donate to the cause. Our graduate student César Vargas, who co-chairs the Rockefeller Inclusive Science Initiative (RiSI), with many other students in the organization, helped organize efforts to ensure that contracted custodial staff would continue to receive pay during the university shutdown. Our Vertebrate Genome Lab, in collaboration with the international Vertebrate Genomes Project, is now being redirected to produce and compare high-quality genome assemblies of species that are vulnerable versus resistant to COVID-19, including those that harbor and transmit the virus to humans. Our hope is that this research will allow scientists to engineer drugs for resistance to the virus and to identify humans who may have natural resistance. Our ability to respond with meaningful participation in the local and worldwide efforts is also being productive.
It is likely that future funding for our non-COVID-19 research will be a continuing challenge. Pre-COVID-19, our current national administration has continuously shown its lack of support for science. Post-COVID-19, the global economic landscape will be vastly different, with a focus on overall economic recovery to avoid a worldwide economic depression. We argue that supporting science, both COVID and non-COVID research, will be a key factor necessary for that recovery.
Even though we know that this global pandemic will be over one day, our work culture and climate has undergone a profound paradigm shift that will continue to metamorphose. Living in the age of COVID-19 has already changed the scientific, medical, and cultural landscapes. The city landscape itself is changing. The Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort has docked in Manhattan, and the East Meadow in Central Park has been transformed into to an emergency field hospital. Every evening at 19:00, the city, like others around the world, comes alive for a minute to clap hands, bang pots, and shout to emotionally support the health care soldiers on the front line; we also like to think they are thanking the scientist soldiers working to find the causes and cures of COVID-19 for all humans. We are making plans for reopening the lab, to be ready to spring forward, but in the back of our minds, we also worry about when that day comes: will everyone we know be alive, will we, the authors of this article, be alive? We look forward to the day when another tweet will be sent: “The first time I am opening my lab after COVID-19. The pandemic affected us all in many ways. We became part of the solution and helped beat it.”

Trump Suspends WHO Funds, Alleges a Poor COVID-19 Response/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MSEIDELCH
P
resident Donald Trump announced yesterday (April 14) that he is halting funding for the World Health Organization, pending a formal review of the global body’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, reports STAT.
“America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions,” Trump said in prepared remarks, according to STAT. “If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals.”
Devi Sridhar, a global health expert at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, tells Science, “This is a short-sighted decision which will be disastrous for the agency. We need the WHO more than ever to support all countries, especially low and middle income ones.” 
Trump said in his speech that the global health agency is responsible for “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,” reports Science. The President criticized the WHO for failing to investigate early credible reports of the coronavirus out of Wuhan, China, according to The Guardian, and told reporters on Tuesday, “Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human to human transmission happening, despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary.”
His criticism conflicts with the fact that the WHO warned the US and other countries as early as January 10 that there was a risk of human-to-human transmission. 
Trump also called the WHO’s decision to oppose travel bans “disastrous,” and claimed that his February 2 prohibition on foreign nationals from China entering the US has saved “thousands and thousands of lives,” reports Science.
Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, tells Science that Trump’s decision “leaves the U.S. and the world less safe” and is “a transparent attempt to shift blame for the U.S. administration’s own failings.”
The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, tweeted this morning, “The WHO’s singular focus is on working to serve all people to save lives and stop the COVID19 pandemic.”
The US was the WHO’s largest single donor in the agency’s 2018–2019 budget cycle, contributing nearly $900 million of the $5.6 billion budget, reports Science.
Bill Gates, whose foundation also funds the WHO, said in a tweet today that Trump’s move was “as dangerous as it sounds.”
O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law director Lawrence Gostin warns in remarks to Science, “If WHO is ensnared in a political and funding crisis, it simply won't be able to provide the leadership that is so urgently needed in this unique time in human history.”
According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the United States is now the country with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases—610,774 as of today.
What Do Antibody Tests For SARS-CoV-2 Tell Us About Immunity?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KOTO_FEJA
I
t’s months into the coronavirus pandemic and public health officials still don’t know how many people have actually contracted the culprit, SARS-CoV-2. In many countries testing capacity has lagged behind the spread of the virus. Large numbers of people have developed COVID-19 symptoms but have not been tested, and the vast majority of people who had the virus but never developed symptoms and therefore were not tested, are not reflected in official statistics.
Federal and state governments, companies, and research groups are now racing to develop antibody tests to shine a light on the true spread of SARS-CoV-2. While PCR tests currently used to diagnose cases detect the virus’s genetic material, antibody tests can screen for virus-attacking antibodies that are formed shortly after an initial infection. Those antibodies usually linger in the blood long after the virus is gone. One such antibody, or serological, test was given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration in early April, and a number of other groups are making more tests, and in some cases even deploying them.
The National Institutes of Health has launched a study to detect antibodies in order to gather data for epidemiological models. And a recent survey of residents in a German town was one of the first to use an antibody test among the public, reporting that 14 percent of people there were likely to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the presence of antibodies.
It’s not clear yet whether milder or asymptomatic cases will develop antibodies.
Policymakers have another reason to scramble to deploy antibody tests: they could indicate whether someone is immune to SARS-CoV-2. With around 3 billion people globally under lockdown, pressure is mounting to re-open national economies. In recent weeks, several politicians have proposed the idea of “immunity passports” or “immunity certificates” to identify people who have had the virus and therefore gained immunity to it and could re-enter the workforce again. Officials in Germany, the UK, Italy, and the US are already discussing such proposals.
The success of such a program hinges on whether everyone who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 actually develops antibodies, whether those antibodies protect against secondary infections, and if so, how long the antibodies hang around in the body. So far, scientists don’t have firm answers to any of these questions. Although antibody surveys of communities around the world could yield information that is crucial to understanding the spread of the pathogen, some consider the idea of “immunity passports” premature.
“People understand that [it] would be very powerful, if we could say, ‘you’re immune now, and you can return to work,’ or, ‘you could safely return to your family if you’re a healthcare worker,’” notes Stanford University and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub immunologist Taia Wang. But there are a lot of unknowns, she cautions. “To get to that point where we’ll know with some certainty what the antibody response means, we just have to collect [more] data.”
The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2
There is solid evidence emerging that COVID-19 patients are developing antibodies to the virus, as the human body does for most infectious pathogens. Kara Lynch, a clinical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have been testing around 500 serum samples from roughly 100 COVID-19 patients who were treated at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where Lynch co-directs a clinical chemistry laboratory. The team is using an assay that was applied to samples from patients in China and picks out antibodies that target a protein-binding site of the virus’s spike protein.
“What we’re seeing is that patients are [developing antibodies] anywhere from two to about fifteen days” after developing symptoms, Lynch says. In most patients, the antibody response is broadly reminiscent of the typical reaction to many other pathogens: first, a flush of IgM, a generic type of antibody, followed later by the longer-lasting and more-specific IgG antibodies. Other studies have yielded similar results and suggest that antibodies circulate in the blood of COVID-19 patients for at least two weeks.
The data are skewed toward severe cases, however, as most of the subjects that Lynch’s group tested had been hospitalized, and it’s not clear yet whether milder or asymptomatic cases will develop antibodies, Lynch notes. “I’m optimistic [but] I’m still a little bit cautious.”
Recently, researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai examined the plasma from 175 COVID-19 patients who recovered after mild symptoms. The vast majority of patients developed antibodies that targeted the spike protein around 10 to 15 days after symptom onset, the scientists reported in preprint. The report generated some concern on social media because the researchers couldn’t detect antibodies in 10 of the patients. That could have been a fluke, notes Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. It’s possible that that the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was a false positive, and those people in fact had a different respiratory infection.
It’s also possible that some patients simply don’t develop antibodies. 
While years ago, “pretty much everybody infected with SARS made an antibody response,” Crotty says, that did not hold true for MERS. Some studies on MERS have found that PCR-positive mild or asymptomatic infections can cause varied immune responses that are undetectable in antibody assays. Lynch points out that in her cohort, there are three patients who have not yet developed antibodies even though it’s been 17 days or more since their symptoms started. Some of those patients were immunocompromised, “but there are examples of healthy individuals that did not generate antibodies,” she writes in an email to The Scientist.
In many viral infections, “the magnitude of an antibody response correlates well with how big the infection was,” Crotty notes. In other words, severe infections are more memorable to the immune system. Interestingly, the preprint on COVID-19 patients in China also reported a positive correlation between the patients’ antibody levels and their age, which in turn, is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. If it were the case that milder SARS-CoV-2 infections are less likely to produce a detectable antibody response, that may reduce the usefulness of antibody tests in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases.
Are the antibodies actually protective?
Overall, Crotty says he finds the data from the Chinese study robust and encouraging, noting that the researchers had extracted the patients’ antibodies and conducted in vitro experiments to see if they prevented SARS-CoV-2 from entering human host cells. “They tested 175 people and almost all of them had really nice antibody responses and really nice neutralizing responses,” he says. This is consistent with a recent study in macaques, and some other studies that have extracted antibodies from COVID-19 survivors and also found those antibodies were neutralizing, that is, capable of binding to the virus and its blocking entry into host cells.
Those experiments are important, and the results encouraging, but it’s still a mystery whether neutralizing activity in vitro correlates with protection in vivo for SARS-CoV-2, Wang notes. And even if antibodies aren’t neutralizing—and don’t physically stop the virus from entering host cells—they can still play important roles in immunity by recruiting other components of the immune system. “In vivo, there are many more cells that come into play to clear virus, to clear infected cells,” says Wang. It may well be that other components of the immune system—such as helper T cells or killer T cells—also play important roles in protecting against SARS-CoV-2.
On the whole, Wang finds it too early to say what the role of antibodies is for SARS-CoV-2. “We have no idea if production of antibodies during a primary infection, for example, has any role in clearing virus during that infection, or for that matter, we don’t have any good data on whether antibodies produced during an infection are protective against a second infection,” she says. And even if they were protective, they may not be protective for everyone. “Antibody responses can vary tremendously from person to person.”
How long will antibody levels last?
Ideally, the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 would mirror that to measles. A single exposure is enough to generate robust, neutralizing IgG antibodies that circulate in the blood throughout life and provide lifelong protection, Crotty notes.
But immune responses to coronaviruses appear to differ. Studies of survivors of the 2003 SARS epidemic suggest that concentrations of neutralizing antibodies lasted for up to three years. Although, a recent yet-to-be-peer-reviewed preprint reports to have found neutralizing antibodies in SARS survivors 17 years after the epidemic.
At this point, all the antibody tests are really just functioning to help us gather data. And then at a certain point, I think the numbers will be large enough that we’ll be able to do a risk assessment.

In MERS, the levels of neutralizing antibodies have been observed to fade after three years. For the less deadly, cold-causing coronaviruses, neutralizing antibody levels also fall off in that two-to-three-year range. One 1990 study of fewer than a dozen volunteers found that people exposed twice to the coronavirus 229E developed much milder symptoms compared with people getting exposed the first time, suggesting that re-infection could occur, but with reduced symptoms.
Antibody levels for coronaviruses might be fading over time because the antibody-supplying cells “are not maintained for decades like with other pathogens,” notes Vineet Menachery of the University of Texas Medical Branch in a recent Twitter thread. However, how long those cells or the antibodies they produce persist in the blood is not a surefast indicator of how long someone is immune to secondary infection, he stresses.
That’s because an initial encounter with a pathogen not only prompts the antibody-supplying cells, called plasmablasts, in the blood to turn into plasma cells that generate specific antibodies. It also stimulates memory B cells. These memory B cells can last decades, hiding out in lymph nodes, the spleen, bone marrow, and the lung, while some circulate in the blood. Upon re-infection by the same pathogen, they swing back into action, taking two-to-four days to differentiate into cells that secrete neutralizing antibodies, Menachery explains. He speculates that one might be able to acquire a second SARS-CoV-2 infection once the initial burst of neutralizing antibodies fades—which he reckons might be after one or two years—but the second infection will be milder thanks to immune memory.
Memory B cells could serve as an alternative indicator of immunity, in addition to antibody levels, but memory B cells are harder to isolate. In one 2011 study, researchers did manage to isolate memory B cells from recovered SARS patients six years after the Hong Kong epidemic. Interestingly, the team found that the memory B cells did not react to proteins from the live virus, but memory T cells from 60 percent of the recovered patients did.
“Different parts of the immune system are more important in protection from different diseases,” Crotty says. For many infectious diseases, antibodies as well as T cells can contribute. “If you have a person who makes a lousy antibody response, but they made a good [T helper cell] and [T killer cell] response, they’d probably be okay. And vice versa.”
What this means for immunity passports
Many researchers, including the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, say they think that based on what’s known from most other infectious diseases, it’s likely that people will have at least some form of short-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Fauci told The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah in March that he’d be “willing to bet anything that people who recover are really protected against reinfection.” It helps matters that SARS-CoV-2’s RNA genome appears to be relatively stable, meaning that the immune system may have a better chance of developing longer-lasting immunity compared to frequently-mutating influenza viruses, for instance, which require researchers to design new vaccines every year.
However, the question is whether antibodies alone will suffice in assessing immunity, and form the basis of “immunity passports” that determine who gets to leave quarantine and go back to work. “There’s nothing perfect about the decisions people are having to make. I’d guess that governments and large organizations are just going to have to make decisions about what is ‘good enough,’ and try and be clear to people [what the tests mean],” Crotty says.
Although it may be true that most first-time exposures to dangerous pathogens will result in protective immunity, it’s scientifically difficult to make the claim that any given person will be immune to the virus if they reach a certain score on an antibody test—not to mention, such predictions carry various legal and ethical issues. It could also encourage dangerous behavior, such as refusal to wear masks or intentionally trying to get sick in order to re-enter normal life, he says.
Regardless of immunity, “with most diseases, if you get exposed to enough virus, you’re going to get sick,” Crotty says—something that is supported by animal studies. And even if someone is immune to the virus, it’s not clear if that means they do or don’t still carry some amount of virus that could be spread to other people, Menachery notes. “In theory, a person could get infected, [and] spread [the] virus before their immune system stops the virus. This is less likely if you have high [neutralizing antibody levels] in your blood,” Menachery writes to The Scientist in an email. “We can’t rule out that immune people might carry virus, but the load of virus would be expected to be lower.”
There are other factors that govern whether the antibody tests will be a reliable proxy of whether someone is immune, such as the accuracy of the tests. It will take some time to get answers. Part of what takes time, Lynch notes, is “monitoring patients long term to see if the people who were previously positive or have antibodies get re-infected or not.”
The results of plasma therapies—which extract antibodies from recovered patients and administer them to patients battling severe forms of COVID-19—may offer some clues as to whether antibodies are protective, at least in the short term. One small study in China has yielded tentatively positive results.
Wang adds that she expects solid answers to come from large-scale epidemiological studies that investigate whether people who carry high levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood are actually less likely to contract the virus again. “At this point, all the antibody tests are really just functioning to help us gather data. And then at a certain point, I think the numbers will be large enough that we’ll be able to do a risk assessment,” she says. That could then lead to answers for the most pressing questions: “Does the presence of IgG antibodies, for example, change your risk for infection? Does your risk go up, or does it go down? That’s the fundamental question that needs to be answered in order to know whether antibodies are going to be protective.”
Crowdsourced Protein Simulation Exceeds Supercomputers’ Power/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GRAFISSIMO
A
two-decade-old effort to predict protein folding based on an amino acid sequence using a network of computers and gaming consoles has crossed a threshold of computational power known as the exaFLOP barrier, project organizers announced on Twitter March 25. This is due in part to a burst in users in recent months responding to the need to understand SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the coronavirus pandemic. The project, Folding@Home, can now perform more than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations per second—multiple times more than the world’s most powerful supercomputer.
Folding@Home began when then–Stanford University chemistry professor Vijay Pande began to enlist users of computers and gaming consoles to add their machines to a network that enabled them to perform computations for the project when not otherwise in use. Over the years, the crowdsourced endeavor has led to 223 publications on protein structures, according to the project’s website, including investigations of disease-related proteins.
See “Scientists Use Online Game to Research COVID-19 Treatment”
The number of Folding@Home participants surged from 30,000 in February of this year to 400,000 in March, and has since increased by a further 300,000, Ars Technica reports, and it now has a peak performance of 1.5 exaFLOPS, making it seven times faster than the world’s most powerful supercomputer. 
A simulation generated by Folding@Home shows how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein opens up to allow binding to host cells’ ACE2 receptor.
FOLDING@HOME
A top current priority for Folding@Home is discerning the dynamics of proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2. That includes the workings of its spike protein, which binds to the ACE2 receptor in human cells to initiate infection. 
“It is well established that the spike must undergo a dramatic opening motion to reveal the interface that ultimately binds a human cell. Understanding how the spike opens up . . . could be extremely useful. Every step along the way could potentially be targeted with therapeutics,” Greg Bowman, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a former student of Pande who’s involved in the project, tells The Guardian.

“I hope people will stick around once we get this virus under control and help us get control over diseases like cancer and Ebola,” Bowman tells Ars Technica. “We’re looking to learn why this is so much more infectious. For the foreseeable future, I think we will be quite busy with this.” 
Discovered: Metabolic Mechanism of Cytokine Storms/-/ABOVE: Influenza A virus particles

A
study of influenza infection shows that glucose metabolism is a driving force underlying the development of the often deadly inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm, according to a report in Science Advances today (April 15). The results, which identify potential drug targets for future treatments, may partly explain why patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of serious complications and death from influenza and other infections. Preliminary data indicate this appears to be the case for COVID-19 as well.
“It’s a nice piece of work building on previous observations from influenza and other viral systems,” says immunologist Paul Thomas of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital who was not a member of the research team. “It really drills down to the molecular mechanism of . . . this metabolic regulation of inflammation and viral replication.”
During an infection, the body’s immune system ramps up the release of molecules called cytokines, which circulate in the blood stream like messengers calling upon immune cells to come and join the fight. In some patients, for largely inexplicable reasons, this battle cry continues even after the invading pathogen begins to retreat.
“The initial point of this inflammatory response is to counteract infection,” says Haitao Wen, who is an infection and immunity researcher at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and was not involved in the study, “but if it is not well controlled, then at the later stage it will cause collateral damage to tissues, especially lung tissue.” Such a sustained excessive cytokine release, or storm, is the cause of death in a variety of infectious diseases including the flu, COVID-19, Ebola, and sepsis.
Little is known about what instigates the uncontrolled surge in cytokine secretion, but there are clues. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is critical for pro-inflammatory cytokine production and, if it is genetically deleted in mice, the animals are protected against influenza-induced cytokine storms. The inflammatory response to influenza infections is also known to drive up glucose metabolism, in part so that immune cells have the necessary energy to mount a strong response, and also because the virus needs the sugar to replicate, explains Thomas.
Shi Liu of the State Key Laboratory of Virology at Wuhan University and colleagues now link these threads, identifying a specific glucose metabolism pathway that is required for activating IRF5-induced cytokine production in cells and mice. This so-called hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, a well-known metabolic process, is also required for viral replication, they show.
Hexosamine biosynthesis starts with glucose and results in an end product called uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)—pronounced UDP-GlickNack. This nucleotide sugar is sometimes added to proteins—a process called O-GlcNAcylation—to modify their activity. Liu’s team now shows that O-GlcNAcylation of IRF5 is necessary for the transcription factor’s cytokine-producing activity.
Genetically deleting the enzyme that performs O-GlcNAcylation, called OGT, or IRF5 itself inhibited inflammatory cytokine production as well as viral replication in mice and cells. The knockouts also improved the animals’ survival of infection, suggesting the two factors may be targets for future therapies.
The team also showed that patients infected with influenza have higher blood glucose levels and more O-GlcNacylation of IRF5 than healthy controls. Furthermore, blood glucose levels correlated tightly with levels of inflammatory cytokines.
Pathway from influenza infection of a cell to production of cytokines
SHI LIU
The results show that “there is a connection [between] influenza virus infection, enhanced glucose metabolism and cytokine storm, all linked through O-GlcNAcylation of IFR-5,” Mengji Lu, a virologist at the University Hospital Essen and a coauthor of the study, writes in an email to The Scientist.
Although the study focused on influenza, cytokine storms are also a common cause of death in COVID-19, and patients with metabolic disorders including diabetes seem to be more at risk of such severe complications. In a Science Advances press release, Liu says, “We believe that glucose metabolism contributes to various COVID-19 outcomes since both influenza and COVID-19 can induce a cytokine storm, and since COVID-19 patients with diabetes have shown higher mortality.”
For influenza and COVID-19, “mortality rate is definitely higher in patients with diabetes” says Wen. But, he adds, the explanation for this may be more complicated than simply an abundance of glucose providing fuel to the inflammatory fire. It’s more likely to do with how glucose metabolism is dysregulated in such people, he says.
Even without diabetes or other apparent underlying conditions, a patient can succumb to a cytokine storm. So the work is “broadly relevant,” says John Teijaro, an immunologist and microbiologist at the Scripps Research Institute who was not involved in the study. It also “opens up a couple of different potential drug targets for cytokine storms,” he says, such as OGT and IRF5. And because inhibiting these factors prevented both cytokine production and viral replication, drugs against these molecules may suppress inflammation “without compromising host immunity and viral control,” Teijaro says, “which is really the holy grail.”

First Saliva Test for COVID-19 Approved for Emergency Use by FDA/-/ABOVE: PHOTO COURTESY OF SPECTRUM SOLUTIONS
T
here are now more options for COVID-19 testing as the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization on April 13 for a saliva-based test, providing an alternative to the swab testing currently performed.
“You want to be in all types of situations with all types of options so that we can have as much testing as possible in whatever form is suitable,” Amesh Adalja, who works on infectious disease and pandemic preparedness at Johns Hopkins University and is not involved with the development of the test, tells the Associated Press.
Currently, testing for COVID-19 involves a healthcare professional inserting a swab into each nostril, one at a time, to the nasopharynx at the back of the nasal cavity, gently scraping the tissue to collect material, and sending off for analysis, according to UC Davis Health. This method is cumbersome as it needs to be done by a qualified worker wearing fresh gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE), which are in short supply. Additionally, many areas are experiencing a lack of tests available or a large backlog of samples to process.
The collection of a saliva sample requires spitting into a tube, resulting in a much less invasive procedure without tying up large amounts of PPE. Per the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) instructions, the testing would still occur in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a qualified professional.
See “Logistical Hurdles Leave COVID-19 Test Kits Unused” 
“Saliva testing will help with the global shortage of swabs for sampling and increase testing of patients, and it will not require health care professionals to be put at risk to collect samples,” Andrew Brooks, the chief operating officer of RUCDR Infinite Biologics, a biorepository backed by Rutgers University that developed the spit test, explains in a statement. 
The saliva test builds on the existing TaqPath SARS-CoV-2 Assay used in existing COVID-19 testing to identify RNA from the virus.
Brooks explains that in addition to identifying carriers of the virus, this form of testing could also make it easier to re-test people who have recovered so they can end their isolation.  
According to validation results provided to the FDA, 60 patient samples taken from saliva and swab tests were in agreement as to the presence of the coronavirus. The agency notes that independent testing by the New Jersey State Health Department of 10 samples agreed with RUCDR’s findings.
USA Today reports that the saliva tests could be given to patients as soon as April 15. Until further notice, the tests can only be administered by RUCDR in New Jersey.

round the world, bench scientists other than those actively studying the pandemic have largely been forced to scale back or even shut down their experiments out of COVID-19 precautions. But that doesn’t mean their skills and expertise can’t contribute to the worldwide effort to address the disease.
In March, a postdoc at Harvard University created a national database where scientists can list their skills as well as available equipment in hopes of being matched with other scientists who could use their support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of scientists have signed up, and there are many other ways to help as well, from donating supplies to reviewing literature to answering questions about the virus submitted by members of the general public.
Things scientists can do from anywhere
Review and comment on preprints related to COVID-19  
Review literature on strategies to decontaminate N95 face masks
Develop tools to mine COVID-19 data for important insights.
Design and develop efficient and inexpensive ventilators
Design and build useful technologies and equipment such as hardware, software, and masks

U
niversity labs in the US that have been certified to test for the coronavirus and are ready to collaborate with clinics and hospitals are facing regulatory and logistical obstacles to distributing their tests, reports Nature. As a result, some labs are operating at half capacity or less, despite the demands for COVID-19 tests. 
Human geneticist Stacey Gabriel of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard says that her lab could be analyzing 2,000 tests per day. “But we aren’t doing that many,” she tells Nature. “Yesterday was around 1,000. What is holding us back? That is the question.”
Several academic laboratories, including the Broad Institute, have invested in adapting their facilities so that they can use PCR to test for SARS-CoV-2, rapidly changing their scientific protocols and meeting federal regulations, as it became clear in late February that tests issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in short supply, according to Nature.
See “Locally Made COVID-19 Tests Help Meet Demands”
Scientists report that the barriers to making those tests available are formidable. “There is a misconception that you only need a PCR machine and a PhD—that is 10% of what you need,” says Fyodor Urnov of the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, in remarks to Nature. On March 30, Urnov’s facility launched its testing operation after facing weeks of challenges. “My life is waking up at 3 in the morning, and thinking of the 24 things that will go wrong today,” he says.
The difficulties arise from the bureaucracy of the US health care system, where hospitals use different platforms for electronic health records and also face daunting administrative obstacles when setting up new accounts with labs, according to Nature. Researchers say this is why many hospitals chose to remain working with the same commercial labs despite a shortage of tests kits during the pandemic.
“The business of American medicine and the way it is organized is astonishingly unprepared for this,” Urnov tells Nature. He says that hospitals rejected 20,000 free tests from his lab, after which his team contacted Lifelong Medical Care, a nonprofit that has now sent the lab samples from homeless individuals. 
Researchers across the country have been forced to come up with their own solutions in order to clear similar hurdles. George Murphy, a stem cell biologist at Boston University School of Medicine, tells Nature that a graduate student in his lab wrote a special computer script that allows patients’ test results to be sent directly to the hospital’s electronic health record system. “The hospital said, normally, this would take six months,” Murphy tells Nature. He has since shared the code online for other academic labs to use.
A representative from the Sutter Health hospital system in northern California tells Nature that the organization requires an “electronic interface between the lab provider and Sutter Health,” and has plans to develop its own internal testing rather than partnering with academic labs.
Nature reports that it obtained a letter to the White House in which scientists described the bottlenecks involving COVID-19 testing kits and offered a plan to help make more tests available nationwide.
Epidemiologist Patrick Ayscue, who investigates biosecurity for the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, tells Nature that testing will become even more crucial as social distancing decreases, and that what the US needs is “a national framework for states to make decisions on testing.”

The Effects of Physical Isolation on the Pandemic Quantified/-/ABOVE: A playground in Maumee, Ohio, where the governor’s stay-at-home order went into effect March 23
SHAWNA WILLIAMS
I
n July 2008, some 400 young people from the Solomon Islands visited Sydney, Australia, for a Catholic youth festival. Short on accommodations—the week-long event drew 223,000 pilgrims from across the world—the Solomon Islanders bedded down in the cavernous gym of a local school. Within days, a spate of fever, headaches, and coughing fits signaled to organizers that they had a serious problem. An influenza outbreak had ripped through the closely quartered group, eventually making more than one-fourth of them unwell.
A large group of Australians were also staying at the school and passing around the virus. But far fewer of them became ill—just 27 of the 255. What protected them?
In turned out the Australians had slept in groups of eight, each isolated in their own classroom.
Health officials treated everyone and mopped up the Sydney outbreak within a week or so. But that limited incident had a lasting impact on the infectious disease community. Written up as a study three years later in an obscure Australian government journal called Communicable Disease Intelligence, it’s one of the few proven examples of the benefits that social and physical distancing measures can have against a contagious virus. As such, it’s a key part of what researchers at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford admit is “limited” evidence available to support social-distancing measures as a response to the ongoing pandemic. Alongside studies of how different cities dealt with the 1918 flu pandemic that killed millions of people around the world, all those sick worshippers camped out in a school are part of the reason you are in lockdown.
Google data from smart phone users show that visits to shops, museums, and cafes in the UK have fallen by 85 percent.
Social distancing worked then. So how is it working now to contain the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic? The answer comes down to two questions: Are people behaving as they are expected to? And do those behavioral changes subsequently reduce transmission of the disease as predicted?
On the first, Mirco Tonin, an economist at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy, has asked nearly 900 people in the country about their lockdown behavior in recent weeks. His results indicate most people are complying with requests to stay at home. Or at least about half the people who responded to the survey say that’s what they are doing. Although Tonin is usually suspicious of data from self-reported surveys on wrong-doing, in this case, he tends to believe the respondents.
“If you ask people about tax evasion you get zero and that’s clearly not true. If you ask if they cheat on their husbands or wives, then they don’t like to admit it,” he tells The Scientist. “But here we were asking, are you meeting your friends, are you meeting your relatives, and those are behaviors that are socially acceptable. So people were probably more likely to admit they were doing it.”
Stefan Pfattheicher, a psychologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, surveyed more than 2,000 people across the UK, US, and Germany in mid-March and got similar results. “More than 50 percent of all participants say they do the maximum asked of them,” he says. And questionnaires in China show that citizens of Wuhan and Shanghai reported between seven and nine times fewer daily contacts with other people than was typical.
Other data support the conclusion that people are staying at home. Earlier this month, Google released location data harvested (and anonymized) from smart phone users across the world. They show, for example, that visits to shops, museums, and cafes in the UK have fallen by 85 percent. In the US, such activity has dropped by 47 percent.
The second question—how much does all this social distancing reduce transmission—is harder to answer with real data. That’s because there’s typically a three-week lag between infection and people dying, which, without comprehensive testing, remains the most reliable indicator of disease spread.
Researchers in Hong Kong have tried to address this dearth of data using a statistical trick called “nowcasting” to estimate a real-time measure of how the virus is spreading. Called effective reproduction number (Rt), it’s a variation on the much-discussed R0 (basic reproduction number) used to indicate on average how many people will catch the disease from an infected individual.
Gabriel Leung, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, says Rt is a more reliable measure than R0 because it varies according to control measures that are put in place to drive down transmission such as social distancing. R0 is an average of recorded case data, which shows previous infections rather than what’s happening now, as Rt attempts to do. Data published by his group shows that the Rt in Hong Kong has dropped to about 0.7 after hovering closer to 1 for much of March. If sustained, that would indicate the epidemic there is in decline. “It coincides with the much stricter physical distancing measures that Hong Kong has put in place,” Leung said at a media briefing in London this week.
Developing a new lifestyle with more distance is a challenge we’re going to have to face.
—Sung-il Cho, Seoul National University
Other researchers have used computer models to show that early introduction of social distancing can explain lower infection and death rates now seen in places such as China. Among the harshest restrictions in place across the world, the Chinese authorities banned people in some regions from leaving their homes, even to buy food and medicine.
Marco Ajelli, an infectious-disease expert at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy, who was a member of the team that carried out the surveys in Shanghai and Wuhan, says his team’s model shows that “the social distancing measures adopted in China were sufficient to control the epidemic.” The results of other models, including one from researchers in Germany published in Science this week, support that conclusion.
Strict lockdown measures are also credited with helping Australia and New Zealand to suppress the spread of the virus so far, aided by both countries shutting their borders to international visitors early on.
There is more uncertainty over the effect of closing schools. Ajelli says his model showed that “school closures alone are not enough to contain the epidemic. Additional stricter measures, similar to those implemented in China, are needed.” Separate research from University College London also concludes that the evidence to support the closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is “very weak.”
See “Study Questions if School Closures Limit the Spread of COVID-19”
As the weeks drag on, such studies are vital to determine when locked-down communities could be allowed out again—and with what restrictions. “We now have a real challenge for social distancing because people are getting really tired of it,” Sung-il Cho, an epidemiologist at Seoul National University in South Korea, said during the London briefing. “Any weakening of the social distancing could mean a new surge [in infection] because in Korea the regular lifestyle is pretty close. Developing a new lifestyle with more distance is a challenge we’re going to have to face.”

Scientists Scan for Weaknesses in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TRAFFIC_ANALYZER
C
oronaviruses’ visual hallmarks, those nubby protrusions sticking out in every direction, are the keys they use to enter cells. These so-called spike proteins bind to cells—in the case of SARS-CoV-2, human cells—to launch infection. To prevent that from happening, scientists around the world are focusing on the spike to reveal how it works, and find potential weaknesses to exploit. 
The spike structure itself is actually made up of three proteins. At the top lies the point at which the viral particle grasps an enzyme on the surface of human cells known as the ACE2 receptor.

This point must be in an “open” or “up” position, flexed and ready to attach itself to the host cell receptor, says Rommie Amaro, a biophysical chemist at the University of California, San Diego. An animation posted online by Greg Bowman, a biophysicist at Washington University School of Medicine, reveals that this looks like a creature opening its jaws.
But in many illustrations that have been made so far of the SARS-CoV-2 spike structure, an important feature is largely missing, says Amaro. 
The structure is covered in sugars known as glycans. They’re thought to disguise the virus to the human immune system, making it seem just like a harmless cell, given that these are also often coated in sugars. In diagrams and 3-D models of the coronavirus’s spike structure, the glycans are usually represented as small, stubby nodules, but they’re actually fuzzier and more obstructive than that, says Amaro. 
“They protect it literally like a physical shield,” she explains. The glycans are so protective, in fact, that the spike protein might have to flex up and out simply to reach through them and bind to ACE2 on human cells. Any antibody targeting the spike structure will have to slot in between the glycans and attach to the spike protein itself.

“If you know where the holes are, that’s where you want to target,” says Amaro.
In order to model what sort of defensive coating glycans give to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, Amaro has used mass spectrometry data on the spike protein, which was recently published in a preprint published on bioRxiv March 28. This revealed the location of the glycans in more detail than was previously available.
An animation Amaro posted online recently shows how the glycans coat the spike itself and also jiggle, which may further affect their ability to keep antibodies off the structure. In the video, the spike sticks up from the virus’s lipid membrane, shown in pink.
Similar work is being carried out by Chris Oostenbrink, an expert in molecular modeling at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. He explains that his method involves using a database of glycan shapes and matching them to what is known about the shape of the coronavirus’s spike structure—a molecular jigsaw puzzle.
“Basically, we put them all on, we look at which ones fit and we take the best-fitting model as a representative example,” he says. An illustration by his graduate student, Jan Walther Perthold, shows the glycans as fuzzy pink blobs covering the spike structure. Like Amaro’s model, this reveals just how prevalent the glycans are and that they present a serious obstacle to any antibody that might otherwise bind with the spike. 
By mapping the glycan shield, scientists should find it easier to find the right antibody peg to slots through the holes in it, says Amaro. A vaccine could be designed, for example, to provoke a person’s immune system into generating antibodies that would successfully latch on to the spike structure and disrupt its opening mechanism or otherwise prevent it from attaching to ACE2. Think of it like jamming a wrench into a machine to stop it working as intended, suggests Amaro.

A study published in Science on April 3 reveals that a particular antibody, CR3022, can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This antibody was isolated back in 2006 from a patient who had recovered from SARS and is much better able to target the SARS-CoV virus, which caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, instead.
In lab tests, the researchers mixed the antibody with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antibody failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting it doesn’t bind as well to the new virus. It’s an older weapon, after all, not specifically adapted to the SARS-CoV-2 target. 
The authors of the Science paper write that they think the antibody might still be effective against the new coronavirus in vivo but more experiments are needed to show that.
It’s interesting work, says Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent who was not involved in the study. He notes that the data show how the CR3022 antibody binds at a location slightly below the point where the SARS-CoV spike protein binds to host cells. This means it clearly does not function by physically blocking binding.
“It’s not one-hundred percent clear how this antibody neutralizes and stops the virus,” he adds.
More promising, perhaps, is work from researchers who found that antibodies isolated from a llama could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro when those antibodies were fused together with human antibodies—a sort of two-pronged attack. In a preprint published on bioRxiv March 28, the team behind the work write that the specially engineered dual antibody works by grabbing hold of the binding site at the tip of the spike structure that targets host cells, effectively blocking it from infecting them. 
The authors also propose that a treatment could be administered via a spray for patients to inhale. That way, the antibodies could be inhaled “directly to the site of infection.”
There are yet other approaches. A number of pharmaceutical firms have launched projects to develop laboratory-cloned antibodies. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, is using antibodies isolated from a SARS patient to find out if they could be effective against COVID-19.
Antibodies or other molecules could also hamper SARS-CoV-2 in other ways that target the spike structure. They could, for example, prevent the protein furin in the human body from interacting with the virus. This would be useful because researchers have suggested that furin helps the spike structure’s two subunits to separate from one another—a process that allows the virus to break open and enter host cells. Furin happens to be abundant in the human body, meaning that we provide an ideal environment for SARS-CoV-2 to infect us. A molecule that separates furin from the virus could stop the pathogen in its tracks and some teams are currently evaluating whether a furin inhibitor could do this.
Whatever we use to target the spike protein, we need to be careful, says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale School of Medicine. Scientists must determine which antibodies bind to the spike structure but also ensure that they don’t also trigger a negative immune response. She points to a paper published in JCI Insight last year that showed how antibodies in macaques infected with SARS-CoV, the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, could sometimes exacerbate the disease rather than quell it.
In the macaques, an anti-spike antibody stimulated blood cells called macrophages to cause inflammation in the primates’ lungs. The authors noted that patients who died from SARS had similarly inflamed lungs.
“I fear that might be what’s going on [with SARS-CoV-2],” says Iwasaki. “The real bad types of disease don’t occur for about two weeks. That’s when the antibodies come up.”
If scientists identify antibodies that don’t trigger a dangerous immune reaction, it might be possible to provide them to infected patients to help them overcome COVID-19, says Rossman. But it would be even better if we could find, for example, a peptide that prompts the production of such antibodies to immunize individuals before they catch the disease.

Journal Publisher Concerned over Hydroxychloroquine Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LILIBOAS
Update (April 13): Elsevier, copublisher of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, issued a statement on April 11 that “additional independent peer review is ongoing to ascertain whether concerns about the research content of the paper have merit.”
W
ith little evidence to back him, President Donald Trump has championed an anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His endorsement has led to hoarding and shortages for lupus patients who rely on the medicine. 
While it may turn out to be an effective drug—and a number of clinical trials are aiming to find out—the clinical data so far are preliminary and, it turns out, possibly problematic.
According to a statement issued April 3 by the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC), the vanguard study cited by Trump and others in their endorsement of hydroxychloroquine “does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.” 
The ISAC publishes the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, where Didier Raoult of Aix-Marseille Université and colleagues reported their findings on a trial of three dozen patients, 20 of whom took hydroxychloroquine (six of these patients also received an antibiotic). The statement from ISAC notes that the journal’s editor in chief is in agreement with the society’s concern, although the society defends the peer review process that the paper went through. “Although ISAC recognises it is important to help the scientific community by publishing new data fast, this cannot be at the cost of reducing scientific scrutiny and best practices,” the statement adds.
See “Chloroquine for COVID-19: Cutting Through the Hype”
Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist who works to improve the quality of the scientific literature, noted in a blog post a number of issues with the study after it first appeared as a preprint, including confounders, a lack of randomization, and reported data that did not match the plan outlined in a clinical trial registry.
Another preprint by Raoult’s group of 80 COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin similarly received criticism for a lack of control group, the inclusion of asymptomatic carriers, and questionable results. For instance, Derek Lowe points out in his blog that 10 patients went from a positive to negative nasal swab test between the first and second day of treatment. “That seems hard to believe, unless they were already close to the cutoff, but here’s a big problem with the preprint: we do not have individual patient data,” he writes.
Retraction Watch notes that ISAC does not appear to be taking further action beyond publicising its concerns.
On March 28, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine phosphate, for COVID-19 patients, and numerous clinical trials are underway around the globe to assess the drugs’ efficacy. Science reports that a number of former agency leaders disagreed with the move on the grounds that it “undermines FDA’s scientific authority because it appeared to be a response not to scientific evidence, but to fervent advocacy of the drugs by Trump and other political figures.”
While the chloroquine drugs have been used for years for other conditions, they are not without risks. One hospital in France trialing hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus had to stop giving the treatment to a patient because of cardiac side effects. 
Are Mesenchymal Stem Cells a Promising Treatment for COVID-19?/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, VSHIVKOVA
A
recent pilot study in China in which seven COVID-19 patients received intravenous infusions of donor mesenchymal stem cells—multipotent cells thought to have immunomodulatory capacities—indicates that the intervention was safe, and that the approach may improve patient outcomes. While all seven patients recovered, scientists are mixed in their opinions on the logic behind the approach and how well it truly performed.
On Sunday (April 5) the US Food and Drug Administraton approved mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatments for use in the very sickest COVID-19 patients under what’s known as expanded access compassionate use.
“The rationale for [the China] study is not clear [and] the results are . . . inconclusive in terms of how effective it is,” says developmental biologist and stem cell researcher Christine Mummery of Leiden University, who has no conflicts of interest to declare. “One should view it with a certain amount of healthy skepticism.”
Regenerative medicine researcher Ashok Shetty of Texas A&M University College of Medicine disagrees. The results of the study in China “demonstrate that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia,” he writes in an email to The Scientist. “However, studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate these benefits.” Shetty was not involved with the study and says he does “not have any conflicts of interest with companies providing MSCs for therapy,” but has previously received project funding from CellTex—a company involved in MSC-based therapies—for unrelated work on Alzheimer’s disease.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can have vastly different outcomes—some infected individuals are symptom-free, others have a mild, flu-like illness, a smaller number of patients become critically ill with severe pneumonia, and some die. Global deaths currently stand at over 92,000.
Cytokine release syndrome
For the sickest patients, there appears to be a frequently observed pathology—an uncontrolled ramping up of the immune response, of the sort observed in sepsis, known as cytokine release syndrome or, more colloquially, as a cytokine storm.
Cytokines are small proteins released by immune cells that orchestrate the attack-and-destroy mode of the host’s immune system when faced with a foreign invader. But if levels of these proteins surge wildly, and the immune system goes into overdrive, the patient’s own tissues and organs can be damaged—often fatally.
The rationale for the Chinese pilot study was that MSCs may help to combat a cytokine storm. MSCs are multipotent cells found in various locations in the body including bone marrow, placenta, and umbilical cord that are reported to have immunodulatory abilities. Indeed, on the basis of this ability, MSCs isolated from donors and expanded in culture are infused into patients as experimental treatments for a number of different diseases. For example, there are trials underway examining the use of MSCs for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—a build up of fluid on the lungs that results in severe oxygen deprivation. ARDS is a common manifestation of cytokine storms, and the cause of death in many COVID-19 patients.
But the evidence for effective immune response modulation “is not that strong,” says Mummery. “Many of [the trials] have turned out not to be significant in terms of clinical outcome.” There’s also a great deal of variability in terms of the source tissue of the MSCs and therefore the type or types of cells that are being injected, she says. And the mechanism of action isn’t clear. As to whether they work, she says, “you have believers and disbelievers.”
See “Call to Stop Using the Term ‘Mesenchymal Stem Cell’”
An expert in cytokine storms, Randy Cron of the University of Alabama at Birmingham points out that there are other drugs in trials for tackling cytokine storms that are already available, including tocilizumab, which was recently approved in China and the US for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases. MSCs, which are more “experimental,” he says, therefore “wouldn’t be the first thing that comes to my mind [for COVID-19 treatment],” but, “if it works, it works.” Cron has links to certain pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for treating cytokine storms.
In Japan, MSCs have been approved to treat another form of cytokine storm called graft-versus-host disease, and are pending such approval in the US. There are also a number of clinical trials starting to test the benefits of MSCs for treating COVID-19.
“There’s a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests [MSCs] should work . . . in this realm,” says Martin Grumet, a stem cell researcher at Rutgers University and the chief scientific officer of CytoStormRx, a company developing technologies for MSC therapies. Grumet, who did not participate in the Chinese study, adds that the data look promising.
The clinical results of MSCs for COVID-19
In the Chinese study, which was reported in Aging and Disease last month, seven COVID-19 patients—one critically ill, four severely ill and two with milder symptoms—were given intravenous infusions of MSCs and, in all cases, the patients recovered with some being discharged from the hospital by the end of the 14-day observation period. In contrast, of the three patients in the placebo control group, all of whom had severe disease, one died, one developed ARDS, and one achieved a stable condition.
The two patients with the worst outcomes (death and ARDS), were about 10 years older than the oldest subjects in the test group, points out Daniel O’Toole of the National University of Ireland who was not involved in the research. “It’s very well established that the mortality rate [of COVID-19 patients] is probably more connected to age than anything,” he says, indicating this may have skewed the results. O’Toole has no conflicts of interest to declare.
In addition to these seven patients, a 65-year-old female COVID-19 patient received MSC therapy in a separate case study reported in a paper submitted to the preprint site ChinaXiv at the end of February. Her condition also improved, but, says Cron, “the patient, at least by many of the lab markers, was getting better . . . before the mesenchymal stem cell [treatment].” So the result is “not compelling,” he says.
“We understand that it is only a small number of cases,” says Kunlin Jin of the University of North Texas Health Science Center who is an author of the Aging and Disease paper. But from the results, he says, “we can see that MSCs are a very promising approach for treatment of COVID-19 patients.”
Stem cell biologist Paul Knoepfler of the University of California, Davis, writes in an email to The Scientist that he is “not convinced at all.” The disease is so variable and the study numbers so small that, “they don’t have the power from a few patients to say anything about efficacy.” They don’t even really show that the approach is safe, he adds. Because MSCs are thought to suppress immunity, “there are also risks . . . that MSCs could weaken the overall immune response to the novel coronavirus,” he adds. Knoepfler has no conflicts of interest to declare.
“It’s a great relief that [following] injection of MSCs into these patients, they didn’t suddenly all die,” says Mummery. But she agrees with Knoepfler that it’s too early to determine safety. While MSCs are generally considered safe and well tolerated by patients, “we don’t know in this particular group of patients what the safety record is.”
Doctors are likely to get more data on safety and efficacy soon. Lin tells The Scientist that his team now has unpublished data from a further 24 MSC-treated patients—all of whom, he claims, have improved. And the FDA’s recent approval of the treatment (for extreme cases and trials) together with the recruitment of COVID-19 patients to existing MSC trials for ARDS around the world, mean data will likely come in fast. “Unfortunately,” says O’Toole, “my suspicion is there will be large numbers coming soon, because there probably won’t be anything else in the ICUs except for COVID-19 ARDS patients.”

Opinion: Lab Work Under Isolation/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, TONAQUATIC
M
y lab focuses on synthetic biology research, specifically, building synthetic cells for studying modern terrestrial life and for investigating the possibilities for life elsewhere in the Solar System. Our work is not directly applicable to detection, prevention, or treatment of viral diseases, so there’s nothing immediately useful for the COVID-19 effort that we could be doing in the lab. Thus, for everyone’s safety our lab has been working remotely since the middle of March as a result of first a campus-wide non-essential operation shutdown order, followed by a state-wide shelter in place order a couple days later. 
Not being able to do lab work means we cannot make much progress on any of our experimental projects. This doesn’t mean we cannot get any work done, though. I share our experiences here with the hope that they may be useful to other researchers during the current shutdown, or in planning for the possibility of future disruptions.
Shutting down for COVID-19 precautions
Thanks to effective communications from our university in early March, our lab had several days to prepare for a possible shutdown before we received the official order to begin working remotely. During that time, we limited long-term experiments and froze all reagents that we were not using in the last few days of work. 
Most of the time, bacteria freeze well in glycerol. If you’re worried about the stability of glycerol stocks, try stab cultures. Those agar-filled tubes, stabbed with pipette tip containing bacteria culture, are good in the fridge for a few months.  
A new microscope was delivered to Adamala's lab the day before the shutdown.

Every group has its own persnickety specimens that always cause problems. For our lab, they are cyanobacteria. The green bacteria grow very slowly, and there is no good method of storage. We decided to hedge our bets, splitting cultures between dark fridge stocks and 4 °C incubators that cycle between light and dark. 
We also have large (and expensive) amounts of purified fragile reagents, including ribozymes and tRNA. There is nothing special we can do to preserve those, beyond the usual storage at -80 °C. We also culture mycoplasma bacteria (ours are mostly goat parasites), but, thankfully, those and our mammalian cells freeze well in regular media. For some cell lines we add cryoprotectants such as DMSO.
On our last day in the lab, we scrambled to remember small things, like moving ethanol bottles from benches to the fume hood. We inventoried all buffers and stocks that need to be prepared fresh, made a list of solutions we will have to make from scratch first thing when we get back to the lab, and threw away anything with less than a month of shelf life. We also made sure all freezers are plugged into outlets that will be supplied with emergency power should the electricity go out—although this was mainly for peace of mind. 
Members of the lab were allowed to bring computer equipment from their desks, including monitors and peripherals, home for the time being. This will help us to set up temporary home offices without spending additional money. 
To help us smoothly resume operations after time away from the bench, I asked everyone in my group to write a brief summary of their current activities, a snapshot of where all their projects are, and what immediate next steps they plan on taking. 
A few people in every lab at our university are designated as emergency personnel, and those of us in this role will be going in a couple of times a week to make sure nothing leaks or needs immediate attention. We will try not to forget watering the lab plants, but eventually we may become a succulent community. 
Luckily, my lab has no long-term incubation experiments, and no animals. Groups working on vertebrates will likely suffer the biggest setbacks in the current shutdown, especially given that some will need time to rebuild colonies once lab work resumes. 
See “Animal Facilities Make Tough Decisions as Pandemic Closes Labs”
Staying productive during the pandemic
Most of my lab members will spend their time away from the lab writing papers. We have plenty of data that need to be analyzed, and we’re working on a few reviews and perspectives. In addition, students still have classes and preliminary exams to study for, and postdocs can take time to review fellowship options and start writing their applications. 
This is also a good time to do things that we have always been putting off, such as lab documentation and the backup and cataloging duties all groups procrastinate on. For example, are all plasmids in your lab cataloged? If you don’t have a master list, this could be a great time to start one. My lab uses a free online database. At a minimum, each plasmid has the name, source, promoter, insert, and antibiotic resistance information. Are all plasmid maps available to everyone? If not, I suggest having people pull map files from the depths of their notebooks and emails and make a shared plasmid info repository. 
Reagents are another candidate for cataloging. Our lab stays on top of this particular task by keeping all the orders in a database, which gives easy access to information about location and how much we have. If you haven’t done that, there is free software to use. You could get a head start on lab inventory by plugging in a few months of recent orders at home. 
Are manuals for instruments, and their most common error codes, accessible to all lab members? There’s a lot of knowhow that gets passed down in the lab lore—for example, which plate reader is accurate for short reads but should not be used overnight, or which incubator cools reliably below room temperature. Organizing that information will help new lab members, and also might help in making informed decisions about which misbehaving pieces of equipment need to be replaced. 
It’s unavoidable that experimental research all over the world will suffer significant losses of productivity this year. However, right now our priority is the health and safety of our groups and making sure we remain as productive as possible so that we are ready to resume experimental research once the pandemic is under control. Our group has learned a lot about how to shut down lab operations in an orderly way, and we’re building skill sets for staying productive as experimental researchers without a lab. I hope we never have to use those skills again.

Opinion: Ethically Accessing Experimental Therapies for COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SUDOK1
N
ormally, it takes about eight years to move a drug through clinical trials and approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the current pandemic, patients don’t have this time to wait for COVID-19 therapies. How can we responsibly speed innovation, access to experimental medicines, and FDA approvals during this public health emergency?
There is no shortage of calls to act more quickly in response to this pandemic. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the health emergencies program at the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, urged everyone at a press conference this week: “Be fast. Have no regrets. . . . The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly. . . . If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. . . . Everyone is afraid of the consequence of error. But the greatest error is not to move. The greatest error is to be paralyzed by the fear of failure.”
Putting aside the ethics of acting without due caution or data, it’s worth noting that the US has been accelerating the drug approval process and approving drugs with less evidence for years. FDA drug reviews now take less than one year, and just 53 percent of drugs are approved based on at least two pivotal trials, in contrast to 81 percent in the past. It is also no longer uncommon to see a drug approved largely on Phase 2 data, without a completed Phase 3 trial, particularly in oncology. 
See “Picking Up the Pace”
Still, this acceleration isn’t enough in this pandemic. Undertaking clinical trials is usually the best way to advance drug development and get experimental drugs to patients, but their timelines and strict inclusion criteria leave a lot of patients without drug access for many years. 
There is a chance that doctors intubate COVID-19 patients earlier than normal to qualify them for the group expanded access program. 
A next best option can be expanded access programs, designed to provide experimental medicines to patients with serious conditions who cannot enroll in a trial. They allow for drug safety and efficacy data collection, thus aiming to support both drug development and access. Ultimately, each drug’s manufacturer must agree to provide drug access and have sufficient supply to meet requests. The question is: What is the likelihood that expanded access programs can work in the face of this pandemic? 
Take Gilead’s remdesivir, a promising COVID-19 drug according to the WHO, as an example. Aside from severely ill children, pregnant women, and Department of Defense workers, patients seeking access to remdesivir for COVID-19 must enroll in a clinical trial or Gilead’s expanded access program. The expanded access program is for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus patients who are hospitalized and require mechanical ventilation. Typically, doctors can also request expanded access to experimental drugs for individual patients outside of group programs. However, Gilead suspended individual requests in late March. 
See “Remdesivir Works Against Coronaviruses in the Lab”
The ethics of suspending individual expanded access requests are challenging. On the positive side, group programs save time. Individual requests require time-consuming reviews by several parties—a taxing prospect when thousands of requests flood a system within a short period of time during a pandemic. However, there is a chance that doctors intubate COVID-19 patients earlier than normal to qualify them for the group expanded access program. There is anecdotal evidence of this happening. In these cases, doctors likely determine that the risks of early intubation are offset by the potential benefits of gaining access to remdesivir, despite the lack of final clinical trial data. Access then can become a function of how well and willing a doctor is to work around the expanded access system for their patient, yielding an inherently unequal system.
In mass critical-care events, such as the current pandemic, bioethics generally gives way to public health ethics. Whereas bioethics traditionally focuses on the health and interests of individual patients and the private doctor-patient interaction, public health ethics focuses on groups and decisions by authorities responsible for large numbers of people. Bioethics tends to be guided by principles such as respect for an individual’s autonomy, while public health ethics on social justice and the just distribution of social resources.
This shift in ethics orientation is seen as critical to saving the most lives. In pandemic triage, for example, we usually prioritize those most in need and most likely to benefit. Additionally, we see who will benefit the fastest, with the least resources. If you can save two people in the time that it would take to save one, the choice is clear. This isn’t good news for the one patient. 
Today, physicians at the front lines of this pandemic face challenging issues. Should they remain patient centered, working around systems to get their COVID-19 patients access to experimental drugs and other interventions? If so, they aren’t necessarily thinking about other patients or the big picture, but they are thinking about the health of their patient right in front of them. In this scenario, a doctor remains a patient advocate while a company, such as Gilead, focuses on population health outcomes. This may not maximize lives saved and it may exacerbate inequalities. And it could very well influence doctors’ decisions, such as intubating sooner to give their patients access to an experimental treatment. But it may also protect doctors from feeling like they abandoned their patients. These are hard choices. Hospital ethics committees and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should provide guidelines—ideally with stakeholder input, including the patient voice—to help make these ethical decisions. 
The FDA is working closely with innovators to expedite their efforts, leveraging scientific information about the virus and about ongoing clinical trials around the world. We are confident that these efforts will have a major positive effect on this pandemic.

European Research Council President Resigns/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, VANDERWOLF-IMAGES
T
he president of the European Research Council, nanoscientist Mauro Ferrari, has resigned from his post after becoming frustrated that his proposals for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic were rejected, according to a statement released today (April 8) by the Financial Times.
“I have been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19,” Ferrari writes in the statement, “for what pertains to the complete absence of coordination of health care policies among member states, the recurrent opposition to cohesive financial support initiatives, the pervasive one-sided border closures, and the marginal scale of synergistic scientific initiatives.”
Ferrari submitted his resignation, which was effective immediately, on Tuesday (April 7), reports the Associated Press.
“The commission regrets the resignation of Professor Ferrari at this early stage in his mandate . . . and at these times of unprecedented crisis in which the role of EU research is key,” European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke tells the AP.
Ferrari claims that he wanted to establish a special program to combat COVID-19, which he understood as “a tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions,” according to the statement. “I thought that at a time like this,” he writes, “the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic, with new drugs, new vaccines, new diagnostic tools, new behavioral dynamic approaches based on science, to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders.”
But the ERC governing body unanimously rejected his proposal, Ferrari says in his statement, leaving him “clearly disappointed, and deeply disturbed.” 
Ferrari writes in the statement that he later collaborated with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on another plan for addressing the pandemic, but when that proposal was passed along to the administration, it seems to have “disintegrated upon impact.” 
Christian Ehler, Member of the European Parliament who serves on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, says in a statement that Ferrari’s ideas failed to align with the legal mandate of the ERC. “Mr Ferrari’s recent proposal to deviate from the ERC’s researcher-driven approach was seen more as a window-dressing public relations stand on the coronavirus crisis,” he writes, “and it was a contradiction to the legal basis of the ERC, which can and does in many ways contribute to the fight against COVID-19.”
The ERC Scientific Council issued its own statement today (April 8), in which it claimed that “Professor Ferrari displayed a complete lack of appreciation for the raison-d’être of the ERC to support excellent frontier science, designed and implemented by the best researchers in Europe.” 
Ferrari also missed many important ERC meetings, attempted to promote his own ideas through personal initiatives with the commission, and was involved in academic and commercial projects that competed with his ERC workload, according to the ERC’s statement.
Ferrari’s resignation followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence on March 27 by active members of the ERC, the ERC states. Regarding the rejected proposal that Ferrari described, the ERC counters in its response that “we did not support a special initiative because that is not our remit and the Commission's Research and Innovation Directorate General, with which we are connected, was already very active in developing new programmes to support this research through the appropriate channels.” There are more than 50 ongoing or completed ERC projects totaling roughly €100 million in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the ERC statement. 
In the conclusion of his statement, Ferrari says that “the times require decisive, focused, and committed actions” and that he will “return to the frontier, to the frontlines of the fight against Covid-19, with real resources and responsibilities, away from offices in Brussels, where my political skills are clearly inadequate, and again at the true service of those who need new medical solutions.”
Clarification (April 9): The article’s title was adjusted so as not to suggest the ERC didn’t want him to resign.

abraham Institute Director Michael Wakelam died on March 31 due to respiratory complications from a suspected COVID-19 infection, according to the Babraham Institute. He was 64 years old.
Over the course of his research career, Wakelam investigated cell signaling and communication with a focus on the physiological functions of lipids, according to the Babraham Institute, where he had served as director since 2007. His lab pioneered high-sensitivity liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology that allowed researchers to measure lipid levels in different types of cells, tissues, and tumors, and sought to understand the role that lipids play in cell function during the process of aging.
Wakelam earned an undergraduate degree in medical biochemistry in 1977 and a PhD in biochemistry in 1980, both from the University of Birmingham, according to the Babraham Institute. He then completed postdocs at the University of Konstanz in Germany and Imperial College London. In 1985, Wakelam accepted a lectureship at Glasgow University in biochemistry, and returned to the University of Birmingham in 1993 as a professor of molecular pharmacology at the Institute for Cancer Studies. 
According to the website for Wakelam’s laboratory, the lipidome on which his research focused is a complex structure composed of hundreds to perhaps thousands of different types of lipids. He and his collaborators investigated how these different lipid species function during aging, including how they regulate cellular signaling processes, and how enzymes that affect lipidome composition are regulated based on environmental changes.
David Adams, the head of the College of Medical and Dental Sciences at the University of Birmingham, says in a university press release that Wakelam will be remembered “not only as a superb scientist but also as a warm, supportive and highly collaborative colleague.”
In addition to his work at the Babraham Institute, Wakelam was an honorary professor at the Cambridge University Clinical School and the University of Birmingham, as well as a visiting professor at King’s College London, states the institute’s obituary. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Biology and a member of the Academia Europaea. Wakelam represented the Babraham Institute as part of the EU-LIFE alliance of research institutes and was awarded the Morton Lectureship from the Biochemical Society in 2018.
He is survived by his wife and two sons.
Study Questions if School Closures Limit the Spread of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MORSA IMAGES
P
reliminary data indicate that closing schools completely may only have a small effect on limiting the spread of COVID-19, researchers reported yesterday (April 6) in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.
“Data on the benefit of school closures in the coronavirus outbreak is limited, but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small,” one of the study coauthors, Russell Viner, a professor of adolescent health at University College London, tells the BBC. The team notes that more research needed to be done to confirm the result.
To draw this conclusion, Viner and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of 16 studies, nine of them peer-reviewed publications and seven of them preprints. The papers reported on school closures as part of containment measures against the first SARS outbreak in 2003 or against COVID-19, modeled the transmission of SARS, and analyzed the effect of class cancellations on the transmission of other human coronaviruses during wintertime.
In one study that analyzed data from the first SARS outbreak in China, the researchers found that students attending school did not play a substantial role in the transmission of the virus to the broader community and that school closures did not contribute to controlling infections. Modeling studies of that outbreak generated mixed results, with one arguing school closures might have played an important role in reducing transmission and another finding the spread of SARS-CoV in classrooms was low. 
For COVID-19, there’s similar disagreement in results, with two studies claiming school closures as part of larger containment measures helped tamp down the spread of the disease. At the same time, a modeling study looking at the effect of school closure alone on COVID-19 cases in the UK predicted the containment measure might reduce deaths in the country by only 2–4 percent. That team concluded that individual containment strategies, such as case isolation, would be more effective, and that a combination of containment strategies including school closures would be most effective.
Although the results did not seem to suggest school closings played a substantial role in preventing the transmission of infection, the authors pointed out caveats with their meta-analysis. Only one of the studies “was designed to specifically examine the effectiveness of school distancing measures,” they note in their report. “Thus, data provided on the effect of school measures were of relatively low quality.”
Still, the team argues in the article that it is concerned that the benefits of school closures, which might be low, don’t outweigh the economic costs, if they prevent parents from working, and the mental and physical tolls, if students lose large amounts of class and social time.
With school closures, “children’s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most,” Viner tells The Guardian. 
“This is an important study that confirms what many of us suspected, namely that the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families,” Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, tells the BBC. “It also underlines how the assumptions used in modeling the pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could, and should, begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through.”
Imperial College London’s Neil Ferguson, one of the authors of the UK modeling study used in the meta-analysis, is more cautious in interpreting the collective results. “While school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling COVID-19 transmission,” he tells The Guardian, “when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines.”
Viner and colleagues admit that their meta-analysis is inconclusive on what to do about school closures other than to argue for additional data collection and analysis. “More research,” they write, “is urgently needed on the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices to inform policies related to COVID-19.”

n early March 2020, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci stated that it would take at least a year to a year and a half to get a COVID-19 vaccine approved for use in the US, and that estimate may be optimistic, according to some experts. There are many unknowns this early in the game. How the early candidates will perform, which will be advanced to later stages of clinical development, what safety issues might arise, and how a successful vaccine will be mass produced are among the questions that are now getting attention and funding.
See “Newer Vaccine Technologies Deployed to Develop COVID-19 Shot”
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a nonprofit dedicated to the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, was an early source of cash for this endeavor and has continued to pour money into vaccine development. Another early bolus of funds came from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to two top vaccine candidates: one made by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division and another developed by Moderna in collaboration with the US government. The US government’s Operation Warp Speed has also invested heavily, giving more than $1 billion each to Novavax and to AstraZeneca, which is collaborating on a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, early on in the pandemic, and investing a total of more than $11 billion (including through BARDA) by the end of September, according to Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

Below, The Scientist rounds up those vaccine candidates that appear to be furthest along. But there are many more in preclinical development. “Nobody knows which vaccines are going to work,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel told Science in March.

Four RNA vaccine candidates are being tested in parallel.
Results from a Phase 3 trial published in December 2020 point to 95 percent fewer symptomatic COVID-19 cases among vaccinated individuals compared with placebo-injected controls. In vitro studies published in February 2021 found that the vaccine was effective against mutations in new variants including B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, and B.1.1.7, first spotted in the UK. Other findings that month from a nationwide vaccination program in Israel indicate that the vaccine was 46 percent effective at preventing disease 14 to 20 days after the first dose and 92 percent effective at 7 days after the second shot. In March 2021, the company announced results from its Phase 3 trial indicating that the vaccine is 100 percent effective in children aged 12–15.
Late stage trials are ongoing in the US, Germany, Brazil, South Africa, China, and other countries. In March 2021, the company announced that a Phase 1/2/3 trial is underway to test the vaccine in children aged 6 months to 11 years. On February 18, 2021, the company announced that a Phase 2/3 trial in pregnant women has commenced in the US. In December 2020, the UK, Bahrain, Canada, the US, Mexico, and the EU approved the vaccine for emergency use, while Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Brazil have given it full approval. Also in December, the World Health Organization granted the vaccine WHO’s first emergency use validation. In early 2021, Australia’s, Hong Kong’s, and Japan’s regulatory agencies also greenlighted the vaccine. On February 25, 2021, the company announced that participants from the Phase 1 trial will be offered a booster shot as part of study to determine the effectiveness of a third dose against virus variants. In addition, the company says it is working on developing a modified mRNA vaccine aimed at variants.

Preliminary results from studies on older adults and those under age 55 suggest that the vaccine is safe and elicits higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than does infection with the virus, and data from the Phase 3 trial suggest that it is nearly 95 percent protective, the company announced at the end of November. A third study finds that vaccinated monkeys quickly cleared the virus. Moderna is developing similar vaccines against Zika and other viruses, but to date, no vaccine of this type has been approved for use.
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials are underway across the US, and in December, 2020, the company announced that it would begin to test the vaccine on adolescents 12 years and older. In December, 2020, the FDA green-lighted the vaccine’s emergency use. Less than a week later, Canada’s regulatory agency did the same. In January, 2021, the EU, the UK, Israel, and Switzerland also followed suit. On February 24, 2021, the company announced it has commenced Phase 1 trials to test the effectiveness of three different types of booster shots against new virus variants. In March 2021, the company announced a Phase 2/3 trial is underway in the US and Canada to test the vaccine in children aged 6 months to 12 years.

Nonreplicating adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector carrying the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is injected into the arm. 
Preliminary results from the Phase 2 trial published in The Lancet in July suggest that the vaccine is safe and elicits an immune response, either a T cell response or an antibody response. Adenoviruses are well-established vaccine vectors, and CanSino produced an Ebola vaccine (approved in China in 2017) using the same Ad5 platform. 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are underway in Wuhan, China. A Phase 1/2 study is underway in Canada, while Phase 3 trials are ongoing in Saudi Arabia as well as in Mexico, Chile, Russia, Pakistan, and Argentina. In June 2020, following positive Phase 1 data published in The Lancet in May, China’s Central Military Commission approved the vaccine’s use by the country’s military for a year. In February 2021, the country approved it for widespread use, as did Mexico and Pakistan. In March 2021, Hungary approved the vaccine for emergency use.

A chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1) carrying the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is injected into the arm.
Preliminary results from the Phase 1/2 trial of people up to 55 years old published in The Lancet in July 2020 suggest that the vaccine is safe and elicits strong antibody and T cell immune responses, and preliminary results from a Phase 2 study published in The Lancet in November finds similar results for older individuals. Preliminary results from the Phase 3 study showed the vaccine to be 70 percent effective on average, according to results published in December in The Lancet, with one and a half doses being more effective than two doses. According to a study published in The Lancet in February 2021 summarizing data on subsets of participants, a single dose is 76 percent effective for up to three months post-vaccination, and a second dose given three months or more after the first dose boosts that efficacy to more than 82 percent. The vaccine appears to be far less effective against the B.1.351 variant circulating in South Africa, according to a yet-to-be-published analysis released on February 7, 2021. A Phase 1 trial using the same adenovirus vector to target MERS is ongoing in Saudi Arabia. 
Clinical trials at various stages are underway around the globe, with expansion to more countries expected. Researchers in the UK will also test an inhaled form in an early-stage trial. In February 2021, the developers announced that they would begin a Phase 2 trial to test children as young as six years old. At the end of December 2020, the UK, Argentina, El Salvador, Kenya, and the Dominican Republic approved the vaccine’s emergency use. In January 2021, India’s, Mexico’s, Nepal’s, Morocco’s, Thailand’s, and the EU’s regulatory agencies did the same. South Africa had also greenlighted the vaccine but announced that it was halting its rollout after the results in early February suggested limited efficacy against the B.1.351 variant. In mid-February 2021, the World Health Organization granted the vaccine emergency use validation. In March 2021, Canada and Brazil approved the vaccine, Germany approved it for those over the age of 65, and Hungary approved CoviShield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca shot, for emergency use. In early March 2021, the vaccine was suspended in several European countries due to concerns over blood clots, but resumed again after health authorities ruled the vaccine was safe. Later that month, Germany and Canada suspended the vaccine for use in people under age 60 and 55, respectively.

Results from the Phase 1/2 trial published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in November 2020 suggest that the vaccine is safe and elicits an antibody-based immune response, although antibody levels were lower than in patients who have been infected and recovered. In January 2021, officials in Brazil announced results suggesting that the vaccine is 78 percent effective, though updated findings released the following week pointed to an efficacy rate of closer to 50 percent, The New York Times reports. Phase 3 trials indicate that the vaccine is 83.5 percent effective at preventing disease, a revision from an earlier finding of 91.25 percent, Reuters reports. In March 2021, the company announced preliminary results that the vaccine is safe for children as young as three years old, according to the AP. Sinovac had used a similar platform to develop a vaccine against SARS in 2004 that showed promising results in early-stage human trials.
A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is underway in China, and Phase 3 trials are ongoing in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey. A trial is also underway in Brazil. China approved the vaccine’s emergency use for high-risk individuals in July, and for widespread application in February, following regulatory greenlights in Indonesia and Turkey. As of March, the vaccine has received emergency use authorization in at least a dozen countries.

Preliminary results from the early stage trial published in September in The Lancet point to the Sputnik V vaccine candidate’s safety and ability to elicit an antibody response. In January, also in The Lancet, Gamaleya published preliminary results from the ongoing Phase 3 trial that suggest the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective—a statistic that attracted criticism after it was first announced in November. 
Phase 1/2 clinical trials are underway in Russia to test liquid and powder forms of the vaccine, while additional trials are being conducted in Belarus, Venezuela, UAE, and India. In August, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the country approved the vaccine ahead of a Phase 3 trial. Since late December, the Russian Direct Investment Fund has stated that more than four dozen other countries have also okayed its use.

In late September 2020, the company posted a preprint with preliminary results from an early-stage trial that showed a single dose of the vaccine to be safe and to elicit neutralizing antibodies in nearly all study participants. In January 2021, the company announced results from its Phase 3 study showing that the vaccine is 66 percent effective overall, including participants in the US, Latin America, and South Africa (where the B.1.351 variant is widely circulating). The company is also developing other Ad26-based vaccine candidates, including its Ebola vaccine that was deployed in Democratic Republic of Congo in November 2019.
Early stage clinical trials are underway in the US, Belgium, and Japan, and a Phase 2 trial is ongoing in Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, an international Phase 3 trial is underway in the US, Mexico, several South American countries, the Philippines, South Africa, and Ukraine. In mid-November, the company announced a second global Phase 3 trial that would test two doses of the vaccine instead of one. Bahrain, Canada, the US, the European Union, and Thailand have approved the vaccine for emergency use. In March 2021, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization also granted the vaccine emergency use approval.

In 2012, the company started development on a SARS vaccine that served as the basis for its new SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. Data from the Phase 1/2 trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine in early September 2020 show the vaccine candidate, known as NVX-CoV2373, to be safe and elicit neutralizing antibody levels greater than those provided by treatment with COVID-19 convalescent serum. In March 2021, the company announced results from Phase 3 trials in the UK and South Africa. UK results indicate that the vaccine is more than 96 percent effective at preventing mild and severe disease against earlier strains of the virus, but it is about 86.3 percent effective against preventing disease from the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant. The South African trial found that it was only about 46.3 percent effective at preventing disease from the B.1.351 variant. In both countries, it was 100 percent effective at preventing severe disease.

Scientists Around the Globe Pivot Their Research to SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: Virologist Timothy Carroll (left) and staff research associate Lourdes Adamson (right) in the BSL-3 lab at the University of California, Davis’s Center for Infectious Disease and Immunology

arlier this year, Mirko Cortese, a postdoc at Heidelberg University in Germany, was busy investigating how the flaviviruses dengue and Zika create cellular environments that support their replication. But as he watched the number of COVID-19 cases climb around the world, including in his home country of Italy, his attention was increasingly diverted to the virus behind the disease: SARS-CoV-2. Cortese and his colleagues had both tools and knowledge necessarily for tackling the coronavirus—so they decided to rapidly shift the focus of their work to address the deepening global crisis. “We basically put aside [our] research projects and focused the majority of our efforts to support the diagnostic team and the clinic,” Cortese says.
Now, Cortese is spending most of his days conducting cell culture studies with SARS-CoV-2 in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) lab—a space specially designed for studying infectious agents that can cause serious illness. He is part of a team that includes researchers across three institutions, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the University Hospitals of Heidelberg and Mannheim. The group, which mobilized over the last few weeks, is working on developing diagnostic tests and vaccines for the coronavirus and pinpointing why some people develop more serious disease than others. There are currently around 50 ongoing projects with approximately one group assigned to each, according to Ralf Bartenschlager, a virologist at DKFZ. “There was a huge wave of support. Many people volunteered to provide their expertise.”
In virology you have to be nimble. If the universe sends you a pandemic, you better worry on that virus rather than one that you think you need to worry about.
—Chris Miller, University of California, Davis
The German team is one of numerous groups around the world that have diverted their skills and resources to help stop the pandemic. While the majority of research at academic institutions grinds to a halt, some labs have kept their lights on to conduct coronavirus-related experiments. These scientists have been working long hours to rapidly apply for grants, design experiments, coordinate virtual teams, and, in some cases, prepare to work in containment laboratories on locked-down campuses. Funding agencies around the world have pledged millions to help more investigators join the global effort.
Rapid action to launch SARS-CoV-2 studies
In early March, Chris Miller, a virologist at the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis (UCD), received a call for help from someone at UCD’s clinical laboratory. “They were having trouble getting the diagnostic tests to work and wanted us to grow the virus and provide the RNA so they could use it for assay development and positive controls,” Miller tells The Scientist. “As soon as he said that, it became clear that we had to move into working with the virus as quickly as possible.”
Within the span of a week, Miller and his team filed for and received regulatory approval, began training staff to work in a BSL-3 lab, obtained a patient sample, and isolated the virus. At the same time, the group was winding down its research projects on influenza and HIV using monkeys, to comply with campus shutdowns, prevent the spread of COVID-19 to monkeys, and limit the use of personal protective equipment such as masks, which is in short supply.
See “Some Coronavirus Researchers are Running Low on Masks”
Right now, the group is focused on cell culture work, but Miller says the team is hoping to receive funding from the National Institutes of Health to develop a monkey model of COVID-19 in order to test interventions for the disease. “There’s this window when we can actually make an impact on patient care and the severity of the pandemic,” he adds. “We think we can make a difference, so we’re definitely pushing really hard.”
Nearby, at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology in San Francisco, virologist Melanie Ott has also been working with her colleagues to hastily get SARS-CoV-2 research up and running. Their current efforts involve adapting a CRISPR-based diagnostic assay to detect the coronavirus in patient samples and using previously established lung organoids to test the both the effects of the virus on the tissue and potential drugs to stop them. In just a few weeks, Ott and her colleagues have set up a BSL-3 lab at Gladstone, and their experiments are now beginning to come online.
Funding agencies, too, are working at breakneck speeds. Joanne Lemieux, a structural biologist at the University of Alberta, recently received a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to examine whether a protease inhibitor her group had developed for the original SARS virus could be altered to treat SARS-CoV-2. “This was probably the fastest funding turnaround [on a grant application] that I’ve experienced in my research career,” Lemieux says. “There was a seven-day deadline to get your team together, determine what aspect you wanted to study, and to write up the research grant.”
Prioritizing coronavirus projects
Biomedical engineer Sam Sia and his team at Columbia University are working on rapid diagnostic tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples and the antibodies left behind after an infection. His lab is in New York City, an epicenter of the pandemic. In addition to taking all the recommended precautions such as social distancing and hand-washing, members of the group are encouraged to stay at home whenever possible. “There is some consternation about going out and about here, which is why I think what we’re doing is important,” Sia says. “But there’s nothing more important than the lab members’ safety, and so people don’t need to be in lab more than they really need to be.”
Like Sia, investigators conducting coronavirus studies are trying to limit the number people who come into the lab, given that leaving home to go to work during a pandemic offers opportunities to help the virus spread. Luckily, most tasks—such as reading the literature, analyzing data, writing papers, and coordinating teams—can all be done virtually. “My lab essentially is at a diminished capacity, but we have sufficient personnel to carry out the research that we need to do,” Lemieux says. “We really want to ensure that all lab members stay healthy.”
Social distancing restrictions mean the number of SARS-CoV-2 questions that researchers can tackle in parallel is limited. “The basic research questions about the pathogen are interesting, for example, how the virus replicates with the cells,” Cortese says. “At the moment we are more [focused] on the supporting diagnostics and the clinic . . . but of course, [those questions] should come later because we need a clear vision of how this pathogen works.”
Campus lockdowns—and an urgent need to tackle the coronavirus—have meant some important non-coronavirus-related projects have been put on hold indefinitely. Miller’s team, for example, pressed pause on a monkey study of an influenza vaccine. “I think flu is still the virus that’s going to be the bigger problem in the history of the world,” Miller says. “But in virology you have to be nimble. If the universe sends you a pandemic, you better worry on that virus rather than one that you think you need to worry about. You’ve just got to be able to move on.” 
The COVID-19 Coronavirus May Travel in Aerosols/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DZONSLI
A
report from the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released on April 1 states that based on current research, SARS-CoV-2 may be spread through aerosols. The letter cites a recent study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center that found “widespread evidence of viral RNA in isolation rooms where patients with SARS-CoV-2 were receiving care” in air and surface samples. Even air collectors that were more than six feet away from patients detected the RNA, calling into question whether current social distancing guidelines are sufficient to prevent the spread of the disease.
To date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that larger respiratory droplets expelled when infected people cough or sneeze are the primary means of transmitting the coronavirus, reports Science, but the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be airborne implies that recommendations about mask wearing in public may need to be revised.
“In the mind of scientists working on this, there’s absolutely no doubt that the virus spreads in the air,” aerosol scientist Lidia Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia tells Nature. “This is a no-brainer.”
A study from the University of Hong Kong that has not yet been peer-reviewed detected rhinovirus, influenza, and human coronaviruses (not including SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory droplets and aerosols, and found that surgical masks worn by sick patients reduced the detection of coronavirus RNA in both transmission forms, according to the NASEM report. Another preprint conducted in two Wuhan, China, hospitals indicates that staff movement, floor cleaning, and the removal of personal protective equipment could transmit the virus through the re-suspension of virus-contaminated aerosols.
“[I’m] relieved to see aerosolization is accepted,” says Kimberly Prather, an aerosol chemist at the University of California, San Diego, in remarks to Science. “This added airborne pathway helps explain why it is spreading so fast.”
Virologist Leo Poon of the University of Hong Kong tells Nature that evidence for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 isn’t yet sufficient, and Nature reports that a study from an outbreak center in Singapore found no evidence of the virus in air samples.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that airborne transmission may be possible during certain medical procedures such as intubation or open suctioning, but cautions that a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that used a high-powered nebulizer to generate aerosols is not the same as real-life situations of people coughing. “Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 virus in air samples from patient rooms where no procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are ongoing.”
Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, tells Nature that definitive research on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may take years, and that we shouldn’t “let perfect be the enemy of convincing.” 
Despite the uncertainty regarding the transmission of the coronavirus, public policy appears to be shifting. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted today that residents should wear face coverings made of bandanas, scarves, or other fabric, and Science reports that the CDC may be preparing to recommend that all people in the United States wear cloth facemasks in public. 
Cats, Ferrets Susceptible to SARS-CoV-2: Study/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, FOTOJAGODKA
Update (April 8): The study described in this article has now been published in Science.
C
ats and ferrets can both be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and can pass the infection on to other members of the same species, researchers reported in a study preprint on March 31. The study indicates that ferrets may be a suitable laboratory model for studying the disease (indeed, researchers are already using ferrets in their SARS-CoV-2 studies), but experts say it doesn’t reveal whether pets could transmit the infection to people.
In the study, which has not undergone peer review, researchers put viral particles into the noses of a small number of cats. They euthanized a few of the animals four days later and tested their organs for SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. They found viral RNA in the cats’ noses, soft palates, and tonsils, but not in their lungs. Other exposed animals were housed in cages near unexposed animals. The researchers later detected viral RNA in one of the three cats that had been housed near an infected cat.
The team, led by Zhigao Bu of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, also ran tests on ferrets, dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, and found viral RNA in the ferrets after their exposure. Two of the five exposed dogs had viral RNA in a rectal swab, but not an oronasal swab, two days after infection, while none of the pigs or fowl tested positive for viral RNA at any of the time periods tested.
Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham in the UK, tells The Guardian that cats had similarly been found to be susceptible to infection with the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, which is related to SARS-CoV-2. “However, it should be remembered that cats are not playing much, if any, role in the spread of this virus,” he says. “Human to human transmission is clearly the main driver, so there is no need to panic about cats as an important source of virus. Obviously, if you think you have Covid-19 and share a house with a cat, then it would be sensible to limit close interactions with your furry friend until you are better.”
Virologist Linda Saif of the Ohio State University notes in an interview with Nature that none of the infected cats showed symptoms of illness, and that only one out of the three felines housed near infected cats caught the virus. “This suggests the virus may not be highly transmissible in cats,” she says. 
Blood Pressure Meds Point the Way to Possible COVID-19 Treatment/-/ABOVE: A coronavirus spike protein (red) binds to an ACE2 receptor (blue) in this illustration.

F
or the past few weeks, research journals have been publishing reports on the connection between medications that reduce high blood pressure and COVID-19. The concern is that the medications might increase the abundance of the receptor that SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—uses to enter cells. Boosting levels of these ACE2 receptors on lung and heart cells could give the virus more cellular entry points to target and potentially make symptoms of the disease more severe. 
It’s a hypothesis that is important to test, notes Carlos Ferrario, a professor of general surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine who specializes in research on antihypertensive drugs. 
So far, the data supporting the connection between blood pressure medications—specifically, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)—and COVID-19 are scant. Yet media coverage of the connection has led patients prescribed the drugs to call their doctors asking if they should stop taking them. In response, several medical associations—including the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the European Society of Cardiology—have issued guidelines saying patients should not stop taking the antihypertensive drugs because there’s no evidence to support the claim that they cause more-severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
In support of that recommendation, Ankit Patel, a clinical and research fellow focusing on the kidneys at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and his Brigham colleague Ashish Verma dug into the literature to address the confusion and reported March 24 in JAMA that there’s no definitive evidence to suggest ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the severity of COVID-19. Another team of doctors, writing in the March 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, came to the same conclusion.  
Instead of making COVID-19 symptoms worse, some antihypertensive drugs may actually reduce the severity of infections, and could therefore be used to treat the disease, both sets of doctors say. A closer look at the underlying mechanisms of the medications has also buoyed another idea for how to treat COVID-19—give patients the enzyme ACE2 as a decoy to direct SARS-CoV-2 away from their cells. A biotech company developing such an approach using recombinant ACE2 received regulatory approval today (April 2) to start clinical trials on COVID-19 patients.
“It’s a very interesting idea,” David Kass, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine tells The Scientist. “Obviously, if the virus binds to this form of ACE2 that’s floating around in the bloodstream and not attached to a cell, it won’t be able to multiply and damage the cells.”
How ACE2 acts in the body
The ACE2 decoy idea can be traced back to early work on the receptor by Josef Penninger, a molecular immunologist at the University of British Columbia. Roughly 20 years ago, he was working as a researcher at the Ontario Cancer Institute when he cloned ACE2 and started probing what it does. 
A senior investigator in the lab thought the work was a waste of time, Penninger recalls, telling him that scientists already knew everything they needed to know about the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance. The senior researcher added that ACE2, which is associated with the system, was so boring Penninger should stop working on it before he ruined his career. At the time, it was a painful comment to hear, but it made Penninger even more determined to understand ACE2’s biological function. “It’s funny now,” he says. 
The antihypertension drugs called ARBs disrupt the pathway that leads to blood vessel constriction by preventing angiotensin II from binding to the AT1 receptor. This now-available angiotensin is then processed by ACE2 (not shown) into the form that leads to blood vessel dilation. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the production of angiotensin II.

Over time, he and others started to unravel how ACE2 operates within the renin–angiotensin system. The system starts with a hormone secreted by the kidneys called renin that cleaves the peptide hormone angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. That cleavage product is then converted into a version of angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin-converting enzyme. That version binds to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, on the surface of blood vessels, lung, and heart cells among other cells in the body. Where those molecules meet, blood vessels constrict and blood pressure rises, which can contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
This is where ACE2 comes in. The enzyme cleaves an amino acid off angiotensin II to create angiotensin 1-7, which dilates blood vessels, reduces inflammation, and inactivates angiotensin II  before it gets to a cell’s AT1 receptor.
“Whenever there is a hormone that has a certain interaction in the body, there’s often another hormone to counteract it,” Patel says. ACE2 counterbalances ACE, and “the body tries to maintain those two in balance to keep things in check.” 
Doctors prescribe ACE inhibitors to people with high blood pressure and other heart problems to prevent ACE from converting angiotensin I into the form of angiotensin II that constricts blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure. ARBs prevent angiotensin II from binding to AT1 receptors so ACE2 metabolizes it, also lowering blood pressure.
“We actually know a lot about ACE2 and its biology,” Penninger says. “We should follow the data.”
An ACE2 boost might distract the coronavirus
Penninger published his work on ACE2 biology in 2002, just before the outbreak of SARS in 2003. After the virus infected humans and started to spread, a team from Boston published the first clues to how SARS-CoV targets ACE2 to gain entry into human cells. There were other receptors proposed as entry points at that time, but the mention of ACE2 caught Penninger’s attention. 
He started a study in mice, and in 2005 published the first definitive evidence that SARS-CoV uses ACE2 to infect its host’s cells. In the same study, Penninger and his colleagues showed that the virus reduces ACE2 abundance, which results in ramped-up angiotensin II levels, in turn causing acute lung failure. The work revealed what made SARS-CoV so deadly, he says.
Based on the data, Penninger’s team argued that administering a recombinant ACE2 protein could trick the virus into binding with it, rather than actual ACE2 receptors. This could then protect endogenous receptors and allow them to continue to function in counterbalancing ACE, and, ideally, protect the lung and heart from damage during a viral infection. 
Penninger has been working on developing a recombinant ACE2 protein therapy for 15 years. He first tested it in mice after they’d inhaled acid; treatment with ACE2 prevented the animals from developing acute lung injury. Other studies showed the recombinant proteins could be used to treat heart failure, and eventually the research led to clinical trials to test ACE2’s safety in humans. 
So far, early clinical trials of the drug have shown it does not have any harmful side effects in healthy humans or in patients with lung failure. (Penninger was not involved in conducting the clinical trial). 
The next step is to see if the recombinant enzyme can intervene in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a study published today in Cell, Penninger’s group shows the drug can reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in experimental models by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000. Today, Apeiron Biologics, the biotech company Penninger founded in 2005, was also awarded regulatory approval to start clinical trials to test the drug in patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, which, he says, could happen as early as the end of next week.
Ramping up ACE2 using ARBs instead
Penninger’s early work on SARS-CoV is part of what prompted the discussion among physicians about the safety of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which regulate levels of angiotensin II directly or via its cell receptor. Another study related to the antihypertensive drugs that got the doctors’ attention was one done by Ferrario more than a decade ago. Administering ACE inhibitors or ARBs to rats led to increased ACE2 activity in the animals’ hearts, exactly where scientists and physicians wouldn’t want more ACE2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2 to target. Or at least, that’s what one might think.
But Penninger’s preliminary work from 2005 implies that increasing ACE2 levels through antihypertensive drugs might treat symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with ARBs showing more promise than ACE inhibitors.
ACE inhibitors lower levels of angiotensin II, and when they do, there’s less substrate for ACE2 to metabolize, which could leave the enzyme idle and therefore open to attack by SARS-CoV-2. That’s part of the argument some researchers were making about ACE inhibitors contributing to COVID-19 infection. However, there are no data to show that happens, Penninger says. Still, he argues, the way ACE inhibitors work in the body, freeing up ACE2 on cells for viral targeting rules them out as potential COVID-19 treatments.
Unfortunately for the country, we’re going to have lots of COVID-19 cases. Groups are now trying to get these epidemiological studies started so we can get answers.

Using ARBs to combat the virus is a more promising approach. As Penninger’s team showed, SARS-CoV reduced the abundance of ACE2, causing hypertension and lung failure in mice. If ARBs boost ACE2 expression, that might counteract the effects of the infection. The hypothesis is preliminary at this point, says David Gurwitz, a geneticist with a background in pharmacology at Tel Aviv University. He described the idea, which seems paradoxical, March 4 in a review article published in Drug Development Research. The main difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs is that the former just frees up existing ACE2 receptors, while the latter leads to an increase in the number of receptors, allowing more angiotensin II to be converted to angiotensin 1-7. That would dilate blood vessels and reduce inflammation, countering any hypertensive state caused by a viral infection.
In clinical analyses designed to ensure that ARBs don’t harm COVID-19 patients, researchers in China have published preliminary data on medRxiv supporting the hypothesis. In the study, the team tracked the health outcomes of 511 patients taking medications for heart conditions who then became infected with SARS-CoV-2. The patients took either ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or other drugs that lowered their blood pressure. The results showed that patients over age 65 taking ARBs were at a lower risk of developing severe lung damage than age-matched patients not taking the medications, but there weren’t enough data to do a similar analysis for ACE inhibitors. The work reveals there was no hazard for ARBs, and there may be benefits, but as always, more data are needed, Kass says.
One way to collect those data on a larger scale, Gurwitz explains, would be to analyze many more COVID-19 patients’ health records to see if they’ve been taking ARBs prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, then comparing the severity of infection in those patients and how well they recovered with the symptoms of COVID-19 patients not taking the medications.
Gurwitz also recommends researchers compare the percentage of people chronically medicated with different antihypertensive medications in the general population with the percentage of them among hospital admissions for COVID-19. These types of analyses could also be done with many other approved drugs, he notes, not just ARBs. 
Already, physicians at University Hospital Zurich have begun a patient registry to do these types of health informatics analyses, and physicians and researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and other public health schools in the US have been discussing the feasibility of starting these studies.
“Unfortunately for the country, we’re going to have lots of COVID-19 cases,” Kass says. “Groups are now trying to get these epidemiological studies started so we can get answers.”
US Selects Two COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates for Huge Investments/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ROMAN VALIEV
T
he US government has announced collaborations with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna to simultaneously support clinical testing and the development of production infrastructure for COVID-19 vaccines, according to a statement from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
“Delivering a safe and effective vaccine for a rapidly spreading disease like COVID-19 requires accelerated action with parallel development streams,” says Rick Bright, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), in the statement. “The rapid progress we are making with industry partners clearly demonstrates a commitment to protecting people at home and abroad.”
Johnson & Johnson announced on Monday (March 30) a joint investment with the US government of $1 billion intended to create the capacity to manufacture more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine, reports Reuters, and the efforts will be funded in part by roughly $420 million from BARDA. The funding will support non-clinical studies, according to the statement, as well as a Phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26 SARS-CoV-2, an investigational vaccine for COVID-19 developed by Janssen, a pharmaceutical subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Ad26 SARS-CoV-2 uses the same technology as Janssen’s investigational Ebola vaccine, according to Science, which was  made available in the Democratic Republic of Congo in November 2019. The clinical trial for Ad26 SARS-CoV-2 is set to begin no later than this coming fall, and could produce a vaccine available for emergency use in the US in early 2021.
The agency will also support Moderna to get Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273, ready to go as soon as the Phase 1 trial is complete, according to the statement. The Phase 1 study for the vaccine, developed in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, got underway earlier this month.
See “Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Vaccine Begins in Seattle”
Bright tells Reuters that BARDA intends to support five to six vaccine candidates, out of which two or three may be ultimately be successful, and that the goal is to work  “as quickly as possible and manufacture enough of [a vaccine] for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.”
Choosing which experimental vaccines to invest in is a bit of a gamble, according to Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), who tells Reuters, “What you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those.”
Berkley adds that deciding earlier on which vaccines to support helps to organize manufacturing processes, but that doing so also decreases confidence in whether they will work. 
Johnson & Johnson’s chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels confirms in an interview with Science that his company and BARDA are both investing in the research and development phase of the experimental vaccine as well as in manufacturing to create additional capacity. “Of course, it’s step by step—it has to work—but there’s no hesitation now to do everything in parallel,” he says. “When we have clinical data, we will have the capacity to scale up to very large quantities.”
Some Coronavirus Researchers are Running Low on Masks/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LILIBOAS

irologist Benjamin tenOever and his colleagues at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York are racing to find drugs that work against SARS-CoV-2. The lab, which until recently focused on a large-scale research project studying transmission of influenza virus between ferrets, is now using the animals to see if already-approved drugs show promise in stalling coronavirus replication or improving symptoms of infected animals. Should any treatment show signs of working, it’ll be considered for use in patients battling COVID-19.
Work with the live virus has to be conducted in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) labs, carefully regulated facilities where workers are required to wear a suite of gear to protect themselves and people who come into contact with them. Facial protection typically comes in two forms: the preferred choice is a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR)—a reusable device that pumps filtered air into a face mask that covers the entire head. The second, sometimes used for less-demanding BSL-3 work, is the N95 respirator, a single-use mask that seals tightly around the nose and mouth and filters out microbes and particles, which some coronavirus researchers wear with a disposable face shield for additional protection.
TenOever has enough PAPRs for the two researchers in his lab doing the animal experiments. But over the last few weeks, he’s found himself low on both N95s and disposable face shields, which the other six lab members need to do the less-risky work of pre-screening drugs in monkey cells and human organoid models before they’re administered to ferrets. His major suppliers are backordered by months. After appeals on social media, he is soon to receive some equipment donations from other researchers who had surplus supplies, as well as a batch of 1,000 masks bought back from online price gougers with funds raised through a GoFundMe page.
The protective equipment is the rate-limiting step for us to get going.
—Melanie Ott, Gladstone Institutes
“Everybody is really trying to help in any way they can. That’s really great to see,” says a relieved tenOever. Without those donations, he wouldn’t have been able to continue research. He had reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is involved in distributing personal protective equipment on behalf of the government, but didn’t hear back. “I’m now okay. Not because FEMA or anything the government did for me, but because of a grassroots movement and simply buying them all back on eBay.”
Respirators appear to be hardest hit by equipment supply shortages. That’s likely the result of mass purchasing for healthcare workers across the country who are now working in contaminated settings, thereby rapidly draining a limited supply that is usually reserved for researchers working in biosafety labs. The situation may also have been exacerbated through panic buying sprees of N95 masks by the public. Although there are signs that supply is catching up with demand, for now, the shortages are a major challenge for some labs, particularly at a time when many researchers are trying to scale up coronavirus research to deliver urgently-needed answers about the virus and find drugs against it.
“It is a difficult and unfortunate situation that is unnecessary,” says Melanie Ott, a virologist at the San Francisco–based Gladstone Institutes. “If [only] we had a bit more foresight . . . we would have been better prepared.”
Dwindling respirator supplies an impediment to research

TenOever says he saw online stock of respirators sold by scientific distributors begin to vanish once cases surfaced in Iran and Italy roughly a month ago, hinting at a mass purchasing of protective equipment. Soon, equipment was backordered by months.
For some labs looking to launch new research projects, the shortages have been prohibitive. In February, Ott, who studies influenza and blood-borne pathogens, decided to start several projects on SARS-CoV-2. One, for instance, will be to develop a CRISPR-based diagnostic test in collaboration with genome editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and others. That meant moving into a BSL-3 lab. Luckily, the Gladstone Institutes had one that wasn’t being actively used, so Ott rushed to get it certified and inspected.
To start her experiments, she still needs protective equipment for herself and her colleagues, but PAPR respirators, full-body Tyvek suits, and other gear are in short supply, she says. “I would say that the protective equipment is the rate-limiting step for us to get going. And so we are waiting and trying to get equipment wherever we can get it.” For the moment, she’s working in a different BSL-3 lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where she is a professor, and where existing supplies of protective gear are limited. “The worry is that we have to basically ration the work because we’re not sure how far we can go with all the equipment that we [currently] have.”
Unconventional options for personal protection
Others are testing unconventional types of protective gear to avoid shortages. Gary Whittaker’s lab at Cornell University received samples of SARS-CoV-2 a few weeks ago and together with other labs, is in the process of launching a number of mouse experiments to study the mechanisms of virus infection, alongside testing drugs and improving diagnostic tools. The team has been sharing four PAPRs between five researchers, disinfecting them between swaps, says virologist Javier Jaimes, a postdoc in Whittaker’s lab. But because another two people will be joining the lab soon to help ramp up research, the team anticipates that there soon won’t be enough equipment for everyone.
Because supplies of N95 masks—a possible alternative to PAPRs—were dwindling across campus, the lab decided to test a new respirator type, called an elastomeric half-facepiece respirator, which is reusable and is thought to offer the same protection as a PAPR, but not an ideal choice because it doesn’t cover the whole face, and it’s uncomfortable to wear, Jaimes says. “The filters are heavy and you have to tie them really tight to prevent anything to get into your nose, into your mouth.”
Once new researchers arrive, the lab will reserve the PAPRs for those who are doing critical experiments, and the rest will be using the half-facepiece respirators. Jaimes says he doesn’t think those stocks will last for long, either. “I think they will also be in shortage soon because everybody that is facing the problem with the PAPRs is going to switch to N95s. If they cannot find N95s they of course will switch to another system like the one that we are testing now,” he says.
Some have suggested treating N95 masks with virus-killing gamma radiation so they could be reused, but that would require bringing a radiation machine to the lab because used masks can’t be taken outside of it. Others are looking into 3-D printing the disposable face shields, but it’s not yet clear if such products would be allowed in the BSL-3 lab, tenOever says. Luckily, he’s not yet had to resort to such options. With the donations, his lab is now well-stocked for another few months—“hopefully until the end of this pandemic.”
Stocking up on protective gear
Some other labs say they’re well-stocked for the time being, such as virologist Matthew Frieman of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, microbiologist Vineet Menachery of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and University of Iowa virologist Stanley Perlman, who is currently developing animal models to study the pathology of the virus and immune responses to it. “To conserve equipment and avoid shortages in the future, we are minimizing the number of personnel who enter the lab on a given day and being judicious in our choice of experiments. We also modestly changed our protocols to decrease [equipment] usage,” Perlman tells The Scientist in an email.
Lisa Gralinski, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says that when her group began ramping up SARS-CoV-2 research in January, they started to build backup supplies of gloves, Tyvek layers, and extra hoods for their team’s PAPRs. For now, they’re still well-stocked. “That being said, we are working at an unprecedented pace and can only hope that what we have on hand and on order is enough to maintain work in the months ahead,” she writes in an email.
Chris Toomes, who manages UTMB’s equipment supplies, says they started stocking up in January while the virus was still confined to China, knowing that “our teams were going to be doing some research on this,” he says. Toomes is making backup plans, should UTMB be affected by shortages in the future, he says, stocking up on reusable gear, such as PAPRs, and redistributing protective equipment supplies from labs currently slowing down on research to those studying SARS-CoV-2.
A supply chain problem
Toomes says he’s “cautiously optimistic” that supply chains are slowly beginning to catch up with the burgeoning demand, largely driven by the needs of healthcare workers at the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re starting to see people that are actually able to ship and provide stuff to folks from across the country [and] from across the globe,” he says.
3M, which makes N95 respiratory masks as well as PAPRs, announced in late March it will be working together with Ford to manufacture more PAPRs and is also ramping up production of N95 masks. Possibly also easing demand, several state governors have managed to procure equipment through the US Strategic National Stockpile, which harbored around 13 million N95 respiratory masks before the pandemic. “But some governors reported receiving less protective gear than they requested,” according to the The New York Times, and The Washington Post reports today that the national stockpile is nearly depleted.
In a statement sent to The Scientist, a FEMA spokesperson writes that together with other agencies, FEMA is “working to meet demands for personal protective equipment (PPE) through new acquisition, DOD allocation, or Strategic National Stockpile sources.” The National Institutes of Health, which is funding much of the research on SARS-CoV-2, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.
With insufficient PAPRs and N95s to go around to both protect doctors and nurses treating COVID-19 patients as well as the researchers trying to study the virus and identify potentially life-saving treatments, this raises the difficult question of who takes priority. “I’m a little torn by the fact that equipment and masks and stuff would probably be better served to give to the people on the medical front lines. It’s not to say I don’t think what we’re doing is important,” says tenOever. “It’s just a really hard line for me to draw ethically.”
Toomes, who manages the supplies both of UTMB’s healthcare providers and infectious disease researchers, says he hopes he never has to make that call. “Nobody can tell exactly what’s going to happen in the future, but we are doing everything possible to ensure that we never have to get to that to that point,” he says. “Research people need to have their gear, they need to be able to focus on fixing this problem at a research level and . . . I have every faith that our researchers are going to [help] do that. We just need to provide them with the gear they need and take that off the plate for them.” 
HIV Researcher Gita Ramjee Dies of Complications Tied to COVID-19/-/ABOVE: COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SUNDERLAND ALUMNI ASSOCIATION AND GITA RAMJEE’S FAMILY
G
ita Ramjee, a South African scientist renowned for her work to expand women’s access to HIV treatment and prevention, died yesterday (March 31) from complications related to COVID-19. Ramjee was the chief scientific officer of the Aurum Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Johannesburg that focuses on HIV and tuberculosis research, and had just returned from a symposium in the UK when she became ill with the virus. She was 64 years old.
“Gita was a vibrant person, a real fighter,” the Aurum Institute’s CEO, Gavin Churchyard, tells the BBC. “That will be my lasting memory of her—how she fought with everything to advance access to healthcare for women in disadvantaged communities.”
Ramjee grew up in Uganda. After the military dictator Idi Amin came to power in the early 1970s, she moved with her family to India and later to the UK. In 1980, she obtained a degree in chemistry and physiology from the University of Sunderland in northeast England, and then relocated again, this time to South Africa with her husband in 1981.
She obtained a PhD in pediatrics from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 1994—a feat that she described in an interview with The Guardian in 2007 as a balancing act between studying and caring for the two sons she had by that point. “I used to get up at six in the morning,” she said, “prepare food, wake my children, send them off to school, do a half day of practical work, come back, pick my sons up from school, help them do their homework and send them to sleep”—and then get up at 2 A.M. to work on her thesis.
It was after her PhD that she became involved in research with women at risk of HIV infection. She went on to head the South African Medical Research Council’s HIV prevention research unit in Durban where she oversaw many trials on HIV prevention tools, including vaginal microbicides, products that could help women protect themselves against HIV infection. She also held honorary professorships at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the University of Washington in Seattle, among others.
“Gita was an inspirational role model for young scientists including women scientists in South Africa and beyond,” reads a statement from the LSHTM. “LSHTM is proud to have been associated with her and we send our deep condolences to her family and friends all over the world.”
LSHTM director Peter Piot says in the statement that he is “deeply saddened” to hear of her death. “I have known Gita for many years,” he adds, “and it is hard to overstate her ground-breaking scientific contributions and unwavering commitment to HIV prevention, particularly for women and girls in Africa.”

Ramjee received the Outstanding Female Scientist award from the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership in 2018 in recognition of her work on HIV prevention. Speaking to the University of Sunderland alumni association shortly after receiving the award, she noted “a need for [a] more holistic approach to HIV prevention, which should include reproductive health care for women” in developing countries.
“I will continue to work with international donors to set the global health agenda,” she told the association, “and prioritize areas of research which will have the greatest impact on the lives of young women, and on public health in general.”
Cells’ Response to SARS-CoV-2 Different from Flu, RSV/-/ABOVE: Like in human cells, ferrets’ transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection lack an upregulation of certain antiviral genes.

ARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, seems to provoke a muted antiviral reaction in human cells and in ferrets, according to a study posted to bioRxiv on March 24. The authors of the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, propose that this distinctive transcriptional response may be responsible for the coronavirus’s high fatality rate. 
“The value of really looking at how the host is responding to this virus is obviously very high and can inform [future work on] drugs,” says Carolina Lopez, who studies how viruses stimulate the immune system at University of Pennsylvania and who did not participate in the study.
Benjamin tenOever, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, and his group were already studying respiratory viruses when SARS-CoV-2 hit the scene, so they incorporated it into their ongoing work. To compare the coronavirus to seasonal respiratory viruses, they infected a lung cancer cell line with influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced RNA from infected cells. They found that, like IAV and RSV, SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in the cells, and that the coronavirus exhibited a transcriptional response that was similar in magnitude to IAV and less robust than RSV.
When they looked at which genes were upregulated in response to viral infection, they found that SARS-CoV-2 spurred the expression of a suite of host genes that was more similar to RSV’s transcriptional program than to IAV’s. But SARS-CoV-2 didn’t appear to induce two important antiviral genes that both RSV and IAV do: those that code for type I and type III interferons, which are part of the gene program that acts as a call to arms to alert a cell’s neighbors to the presence of a viral intruder. The coronavirus did boost the expression of two unique cytokines, secreted factors that have been previously shown to be associated with inflammation in the lungs.
The researchers hypothesized that the modest response in the lung cancer cell line could be because these cells do not express the main receptor, known as ACE2, that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get in, so they tried infecting primary human lung cells, which do have ACE2, and sequencing RNA to assess gene expression in infected and mock-infected cells. The primary human lung cells had a similar transcriptional response as the lung cancer cells, including undetectable levels of type I and III interferon transcripts.
At this point, they wanted to try an animal model. Mouse were out, tenOever explains, because they don’t have a compatible ACE2 receptor. But his group and their collaborators in Randy Albrecht’s lab at Mount Sinai already had a lot of data on flu in ferrets, which provided a ready comparison. Ferrets are “the gold standard for influenza experimentation . . . because they get very similar symptoms. They get a fever; they get a runny nose. They feel a little malaise, and then they recover,” tenOever says. Plus, a report that a COVID-19–positive patient passed the virus to her dog indicated that the ACE2 receptor present in the order Carnivora, which includes both dogs and ferrets, was probably compatible with SARS-CoV-2.
When the researchers infected ferrets with SARS-CoV-2, they saw that the ferrets did get sick with a fever and shed viral particles, meaning that the virus was capable of replicating. They compared the genes expressed in cells collected by squirting a little saline up the animals’ noses after SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections and found that the coronavirus antiviral response was diminished compared to the response to IAV.
“It’s a very underwhelming response,” says tenOever.
Since they posted the preprint, the authors have continued to monitor the antiviral response in the ferrets, and they see the similar transcriptional responses over time. “The ones that are there are consistent. The ones that are absent that should be there are consistent, and it’s unclear whether or not the virus is actively blocking certain arms of that response.” That’s possible, he adds, because there are host shut-off mechanisms that the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV, uses, and SARS-CoV-2 may do the same thing.
“I’m curious how this corresponds to the other zoonotic coronaviruses. That’s really the big question,” says Emma Loveday, who studies viral infections at Montana State University and did not participate in the work. The next step would be to compare SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome to determine whether this muted response is a unique aspect of the novel coronavirus or something that’s seen with all of them, she adds.
tenOever theorizes that the snapshot of what they’ve seen in cells and animals may explain why older people seem to have more severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It’s already known that the immune system becomes less effective with age. People under 50 probably have a pretty strong immune system, he says, so even if they only mount half the response that would be expected to a respiratory virus, that’s probably sufficient to neutralize the virus.
The most interesting thing is that “there are some genes that they identify that they don’t see in the other viruses,” Lopez says. She cautions that it can be complicated to compare the magnitude of host transcriptional reactions to different viruses that are like “pears and apples” side by side, but when it comes to SARS-CoV-2, she says, “everything that comes out right now is valuable. It’s informative in one way or another.”

FDA Gives Abbott Emergency Use of Five-Minute Coronavirus Test/-/ABOVE: ABBOTT
T
he US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization of Abbott’s newest coronavirus test, which can read out positive results within 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes. The portable ID NOW machine, which will run the SARS-CoV-2 test, can be used in doctor’s offices, expanding the availability of testing beyond hospital and laboratory settings, and the company aims to produce 50,000 tests daily starting next week.
The FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to other point-of-care coronavirus tests, namely, Cepheid’s 45-minute assay and Mesa Biotech’s 30-minute test. As STAT reported, Cepheid’s test would be applied in urgent situations, say, to help with triaging patients, rather than in doctor’s offices. Mesa’s instrument, like Abbott’s, can be used in doctor’s offices, nursing facilities, and elsewhere.
COVID-19 diagnoses have topped 140,000 in the US and deaths have surpassed 2,400, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The US has been slow to ramp up testing, and the FDA has worked to expedite emergency approvals to get more products to healthcare facilities. EUA is a “relaxed standard” that requires fewer data supporting the product, according to a statement from the FDA, and so far the agency has granted 20 coronavirus tests emergency use.
See “Locally Made COVID-19 Tests Help Meet Demands”
“We know how important it is to get point-of-care tests out in the field quickly,” FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn says in a statement to USA Today. “These tests that can give results quickly can be a game changer in diagnosing COVID-19.”
The ID NOW instrument has been in use for years to test patients for influenza, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus. A spokesperson for Abbott tells Business Insider the COVID-19 tests will become available April 1. According to US Today, there are roughly 18,000 ID Now devices in use, and it’s not clear whether more instruments will be produced in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 tests.

Africa Contributes SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing to COVID-19 Tracking/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GILNATURE

hree days after the confirmation of Nigeria’s first COVID-19 case, the genome sequencing results of the SARS-CoV-2 specimen were announced on March 1. The sputum samples, taken from an Italian consultant who entered Nigeria through Lagos on February 27 before traveling to the neighboring Ogun State, were analyzed at the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) at Redeemer University. They became the first analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa, signaling the continent’s contribution to the growing global body of evidence to understand the virus’s behavior outside China.
“We have moved from being spectators to contributors and players in the field of infectious disease genomics,” Christian Happi, ACEGID director in Ede, Nigeria, who led the sequencing effort, tells The Scientist.
Whether the tool is used for disease outbreaks or routine surveillance, we now have the capacity to perform in-country sequencing, which has traditionally been done through collaborations with laboratories outside the countries.

Nigeria’s demonstration of rapid sequencing during a health emergency shows that African countries have capacities to monitor the progression of an infectious disease outbreak in real time to understand transmission patterns, says Chikwe Ihekweazu, the director general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control based in Abuja. 
Africa’s ability to sequence its own COVID-19 cases demonstrates that countries in the region have invested in diagnostic capabilities, says Ihekweazu. “Whether the tool is used for disease outbreaks or routine surveillance, we now have the capacity to perform in-country sequencing, which has traditionally been done through collaborations with laboratories outside the countries,” he tells The Scientist. 
The Africa Center for Disease Control (CDC) is encouraging countries that have the ability to sequence their own samples to do so, while those that cannot should send their samples to institutions such as ACEGID, Sofonias Kifle Tessema, the head of the genomic sequencing program at Africa CDC, tells The Scientist.
Africa CDC says 4,871 total COVID-19 cases have been reported in 46 African countries with a total of 152 deaths and 340 recoveries as of March 30. ACEGID has enough expertise and equipment to sequence all confirmed cases from Africa so far, but would need more reagents and additional staff to support bigger outbreaks, says Happi. Each sequencing costs about $600 US.
The center got its first equipment and staff in January 2014 from a World Bank investment of $8 million US that was part of a $165 million package for 19 higher education institutions specializing in STEM initiatives in eight West African nations. 
The need to enable Africa to contribute to the genomics revolution, and to reduce the knowledge and economic gaps between the rest of the world and Africa, prompted this investment, Happi says. “I wanted to use genomics technologies and to address health problems in Africa, especially infectious disease and facilitate outbreak response,” he says.  
Long before the coronavirus epidemic struck, in 2014, ACEGID sequencing gave the first accurate diagnosis of the Ebola virus in Nigeria. 
The ability to conduct genomic sequencing locally will contribute to the global fight against COVID-19, says Denis Chopera, the program executive manager of the Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence at the Africa Research Institute (SANTHE) in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. “Viruses can easily change form to adapt to the environment and evade recognition by the immune system and drugs so it is crucial to understand all these aspects of this virus,” says Chopera. “Remember, it is a new virus and very little is known about it,” he adds. SANTHE has the expertise and resources for sequencing, but is not actively working on coronavirus samples as all laboratory tests are being conducted by the South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases.
The World Health Organization has been supporting African governments with early detection by providing thousands of COVID-19 testing kits to countries, training dozens of health workers, and strengthening surveillance in communities, resulting in 46 countries being able test for COVID-19. So far, the number of cases in Africa is dwarfed by those on other continents.
The initial cases detected in Africa were from travelers coming from countries with widespread outbreaks. “The Nigeria virus is similar to the viruses recently circulating in Europe, which is consistent with the travel history of the COVID-19 patient,” Ihekweazu says of the first case.
“I do not think that the sequence can tell us why there are few cases in Africa at this point as it is highly likely that the climate in Africa is the reason. However, we will know whether the virus is changing to adapt to the climate, which is a possibility and this could result in more cases on the African continent,” Chopera tells The Scientist. 
Ihekweazu says a number of different factors can be contributing to the limited number of cases detected, and sequencing will provide evidence to show if SARS-CoV-2 is changing, if it’s acquired during hospitalization, and if importations from other countries are still causing outbreaks or if community transmission is driving numbers upward. 
For Akebe Luther King Abia, a Cameroonian environmental microbiologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, the biggest contribution African scientists can bring are their experiences with previous outbreaks such as Ebola. After the first SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003, scientists within the continent started looking for other members of the coronavirus family in bats and developing methods to detect them, for instance. Medical personnel were trained and health infrastructure was improved to handle future emergencies. Following the previous SARS and Ebola outbreaks, Nigeria created the Nigerian Center for Disease Control and established a network of laboratories within the country for rapid identification of cases.
“It is no doubt that most countries on the continent do not have sophisticated equipment, but the fact that they have been exposed to numerous diseases outbreaks has made most of them to be ready with what they have,” Abia tells The Scientist.

COVID-19 Vaccine Developers Gain Enhanced Access to Supercomputers/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, CASARSAGURU
E
arlier this week, the White House announced the creation of the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a coalition of federal agencies, academic institutions, and partners in industry to provide researchers working on vaccine development access to supercomputers, with an aim to expedite the end of the current pandemic.
There are currently three research institutions in the consortium: MIT, the University of California, San Diego, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York. They are joined by federal agencies including the National Science Foundation, NASA, and laboratories within the Department of Energy along with industry juggernauts IBM, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Hewlett Packard.
The announcement of this consortium comes on the coattails of the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Database, an open-access project from the National Institutes of Health that provides data from more than 44,000 articles about SARS-CoV-2 available for AI analysis.
“Something we’ve seen as this pandemic has taken hold is the entire research community is ready, willing and eager to help assist the American people in this time of crisis,” US Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios tells The Wall Street Journal.
The 16 supercomputers in the network represent 330 petaflops, 775,000 CPU cores, and 34,000 graphics processing units. As a comparison, it would take nearly 100,000 new MacBook Pros working at peak performance to match the results of the supercomputers. Researchers can apply for access to the computers to run AI-assisted simulations of specific molecules related to vaccine development and new therapies. The simulations can help predict mutations and evolution of the virus, which are typically difficult for ordinary computers because of the number of variables that need to be considered.
Another supercomputer collective that is taking on COVID-19 is the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI), uniting the eponymous artificial intelligence company C3.ai with various academic institutions and private companies. The institute is planning on investing more than $365 million into grants during the first five years of operation to advance AI techniques for use in the public and private sector, but in these early days, the focus will be on containing COVID-19.
C3.ai DTI is co-directed by S. Shankar Sastry, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and Rayadurgam Srikant, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Both of them have extensive experience with the supercomputers at their respective institutions, according to The New York Times.
“The probability of something good not coming out of this is zero,” Thomas Siebel, CEO and co-founder of C3.ai, explains to the Times.
Applications for access to the supercomputer network are now being accepted. C3.ai DTI anticipates providing 26 grants worth up to $500,000 each year. Results of projects that make use of the computers are required to provide public access to the results. To apply for a grant, the principal investigator of the project must be at one of the partnering universities, but team members can be brought aboard from any location.
“Ultimately, we need a cure. To be able to tackle that, we need to accelerate science,” Dario Gil, director of IBM Research, tells the WSJ. “We do have an extreme sense of urgency.”
EPA Protections Relaxed During Coronavirus Pandemic/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SKYHOBO
T
he Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday (March 26) that it will not penalize companies for failing to meet a range of environmental standards during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The Hill. The temporary policy marks a “sweeping suspension” of the laws currently in place, The Hill reports, and has no set end date. 
Earlier this week, the American Petroleum Institute asked the EPA for the rules governing the repair of leaky equipment and the monitoring of water pollution to be suspended, reports The Hill. Additional industries effectively asked for an extension on deadlines to meet a number of other environmental goals.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler says in a statement that the agency “is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements.”
The statement specifies that during the outbreak, the EPA will focus on acute risks and imminent threats to both public health and the environment.
“This EPA statement is essentially a nationwide waiver of environmental rules for the indefinite future,” Cynthia Giles, the former head of the agency’s Office of Enforcement during President Barack Obama’s administration, says in remarks to The Hill. “It tells companies across the country that they will not face enforcement even if they emit unlawful air and water pollution in violation of environmental laws, so long as they claim that those failures are in some way ‘caused’ by the virus pandemic. And it allows them an out on monitoring too, so we may never know how bad the violating pollution was.”
Eric Schaeffer, a former director of civil enforcement at the EPA and currently the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, tells The Hill, “It is not clear why refineries, chemical plants, and other facilities that continue to operate and keep their employees on the production line will no longer have the staff or time they need to comply with environmental laws.”
The EPA memo states that companies should “make every effort to comply with their environmental compliance obligations,” and when that isn’t possible, they should “minimize the effects and duration” of their noncompliance.
“During this extraordinary time, EPA believes that it is more important for facilities to ensure that their pollution control equipment remains up and running and the facilities are operating safely, than to carry out routine sampling and reporting,” EPA spokeswoman Andrea Woods tells The Hill.
Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA during the Obama administration and is now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, tells the Associated Press that the new policy is “an open license to pollute,” and that the current administration is “taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.”
Animal Facilities Make Tough Decisions as Pandemic Closes Labs/-/ABOVE: ©ISTOCK.COM,

icole Ward, who studies inflammatory skin diseases at Case Western Reserve University, was all set to ship the last six mice in a cohort to a collaborator at the University of Michigan for analysis next week. But then she got word that the University of Michigan would no longer accept any animals, as the university scaled back operations to only essential research to limit the number of people on campus and protect the community from COVID-19. Case Western followed with similar reductions in in-person research activities.
“We’re lucky,” Ward says. “What we’ve been told is: don’t start any new experiments, but you’re allowed to continue the experiments that you have ongoing.”
That’s not the case everywhere. About three weeks ago, Sarah Gaffen, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told her lab members to start shutting down experiments out of concern for their safety as the virus spread. On March 18, that reduction was formalized in a message from administrators at Pitt mandating that non-essential research stop two days later. “We are basically shuttered. We stopped everything except for minimal mouse maintenance,” she says. “We’re not allowed to buy them. We’re not allowed to breed them up.”
Bianca Coleman, Gaffen’s lab manager, continues to report to work to care for the mouse colonies. But she is also taking steps to shrink the population, so that if she or the university’s animal care workers get sick, the mice that remain can be supervised by fewer people. Since the cut backs started, she’s reduced the colonies by about 80 cages, which might each have a handful of mice, and still expects to make further reductions of the 300–400 cages she typically oversees, she tells The Scientist in an email.
“Right now, it’s hard sorting out who needs to go and who should stay to keep the colonies afloat,” Coleman writes. “Almost all of our colonies are unique strains and crosses that aren’t available commercially, so if we lose the line that means years of work and thousands of dollars lost.”
I predict that we have lost at least a year on our mouse-based projects. This is devastating for everyone.
—Kathleen Millen, Seattle Children’s Hospital Research Institute
The mental strain of euthanizing animals takes a toll, as does the physical distancing she’s practicing to make sure she avoids getting sick and can keep showing up to work, she adds. “I love my job, and while these times can be very uncertain and a little scary, I don't mind going into work to make sure that my animals are properly taken care of, and my duties are continually being done.”
That uncertainty is also on the mind of Gregory Lawson, a veterinarian and the director of the office of laboratory animal care at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). He tells The Scientist that he’s trying to keep things running as usual, meaning researchers haven’t needed to reduce their colonies, although the university has asked people not to start any new experiments and to suspend on-campus research as much as possible. He’s developed a system of shift work for the animal care staff to limit their contact and minimize the chances for viral transmission. “So far it’s working really well,” he says, but he has contingency plans in place for “minor, moderate, and severe loss of employees based on illness.”
If there were a major drop in employees due to the virus, Lawson says, animal care would focus on the basics: food, water, health, and cage cleanliness. If necessary, they’d move to cleaning individual cages on an as-needed basis, rather than switching all the cages on a rack at once for clean ones with fresh bedding, and his team is preparing instructional videos in case they need to enlist the help of researchers who aren’t as well-versed in mouse care.  
 “I don’t want investigators to lose animals if they don’t need to,” he says. “If we can make a healthy employee group, then we are going to be fine, even in the long term.” 
See “Bay Area Researchers Close Labs Under New Restrictions”
Ramifications to last longer than any shutdowns
Lawson’s planning and management is much appreciated by Daniela Kaufer, who studies brain plasticity at UCB, but keeping her colonies intact does not mean that Kaufer and other rodent researchers won’t see ramifications of stopping work for however long the shutdowns last. Because her team’s experiments span the lifespan, they often have mice with perfectly timed pregnancies destined for one suite of experiments, animals that have been trained to participate in investigations of their behavior, or aging mice that are kept alive for upwards of two years, she explains. 
“It’s already a big undertaking to do this kind of research on animals, and then if something like this comes where you’re in the middle of experiments and you can’t use them at the right age or if we have to cull animals that are aged, this is pretty devastating,” she says.
The shutdowns are “going to set us back a year easily because realistically I don’t think we’re going to be back [in lab] for several months minimum. Then you have to ramp up,” says Gaffen. “This is going to have an impact, particularly on junior faculty. It’s going to cause huge losses of momentum for them.”
Junior faculty and trainees will be disproportionately affected, agrees Kathleen Millen, a neuroscientist at Seattle Children’s Hospital Research Institute, in an email to The Scientist. There, researchers have also reduced mouse colony sizes and put experiments on hold. Even if work starts again before the two or three months that they’re anticipating being shut down, it will take months to regenerate mouse colonies, expand breeding, and revive strains from frozen stocks, she writes. “Mouse suppliers are certain to be swamped with orders for common strains, which will also cause delays. I predict that we have lost at least a year on our mouse-based projects. This is devastating for everyone.”
But even though they knew it would be devastating, people stopped experiments and the animal care staff stepped up to continue essential duties, she adds. “We all need to remember: people are more important than projects. Our safety and that of our broader community is more important than our individual lab’s work right now.”

Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19/-/ABOVE: Brown University, one of dozens of institutions that have issued hiring freezes

H
eather Ray, a developmental biology postdoc at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who studies the genetics of birth defects, received an email on March 24 from the search committee for a faculty job to which she had applied. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting hiring freeze at the university, Ray says the email read, the search and position had been canceled.
“I hadn’t even thought that this might happen,” she says. 
A few minutes later, Ray received an email from a search committee in her own department that had been interviewing applicants for two open positions. Three candidates had completed in-person interviews for those positions, and all three had been invited back to campus for a second round of interviews. The University of Alabama at Birmingham had recently announced that it too was suspending hiring for individuals who did not have a documented offer, which meant that the search in Ray’s department was also called off. 
“All of the work that they did, that’s just gone away,” she says, because when the job is posted again in the fall, or the following year, the search committee “will have to start all over.”
A day earlier, on March 23, Brown University announced the suspension of all new hiring for the current year and for the fiscal year starting on July 1. “At the same time that supporting our community’s health and safety remain a top priority,” reads the university’s press release, “the financial consequences resulting from the increased expenditures and the dramatic reductions in revenue provoked by the current pandemic demand prompt attention.”
Numerous other universities have made similar announcements about the suspension of hiring, including Miami University of Ohio, Wright State University, Villanova University, the University of Nevada, Reno, Indiana University, and the University of Auckland in New Zealand, which cites the travel ban affecting Chinese students as one of the main causes of its freeze. The Professor Is In, a website and consulting service for applicants on the academic job market, posted yesterday an unofficial list of 58 universities that had issued some form of a hiring freeze. Comments in response to that post point to additional universities that have also scaled back hiring to various degrees.
James McGrath, a postdoc in digital public humanities at Brown University, tweeted about Brown’s announcement on Tuesday, eliciting responses from students and academics in various disciplines.
I am struggling to write applications through the fog of depression that has settled on me and I just feel...stupid? Like, will anyone even look at these? Good luck to you in this difficult time!
— Dr. Erin Spampinato (@spampinato_erin) March 23, 2020
“The worry is with an institution like Brown that has the endowment that it has and the resources that it has,” McGrath tells The Scientist. “If they’re making this decision, you can only wonder . . . what kinds of decisions [institutions with fewer resources] are going to be making.” He says the hiring freezes in response to the coronavirus pandemic are “a sign that the whole higher ed job market, which is already in bad shape, is heading for darker times.”
A summary from the Senate Appropriations Committee released yesterday specified that the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by the Senate Wednesday (March 25) and currently being considered by the House would include at least $1.25 billion for federal research agencies working on the coronavirus, as well as $14.25 billion for universities that have been forced to shut down during the pandemic, which may funnel aid to labs whose work has been disrupted, Science reports. 
But how that stimulus package may affect those currently searching for academic positions remains unclear.
“It’s definitely scary as someone who is looking for another postdoc or potentially applying to faculty jobs to have this looming situation,” says Kishana Taylor, a postdoc in microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of California, Davis. “If universities are going along the same lines as Brown,” Taylor says, “essentially, there won’t be any applications to put in in the fall.” She notes that the job market is always competitive, especially in the biomedical sciences, and that the hiring freezes will only increase that competition. 
Ray agrees, adding that if the current situation persists, universities may experience a bottleneck where “two or three years’ worth of applicants [are] all trying for the same number of positions at one time.”
Julie Craft Van De Weghe, a cellular biology postdoc at the University of Washington whose research focuses on primary cilia and Joubert syndrome, says she wonders whether the terms of her K99 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institutes of Health will be adjusted if the current lack of hiring in academia persists. The grant is supposed to cover two years of a postdoc and the first three years of a faculty position, according to Craft Van De Weghe, but she is unsure what would happen if she’s unable to secure an academic job in the coming year. “I will be reevaluating my contingency plans,” she says.
The hiring freezes and their effects on the larger scientific community also concern Craft Van De Weghe. Although universities are producing researchers “well-trained to contribute to humanity’s knowledge of how science works,” she says, “we’ll lose a ton of good people who could have made substantial contributions.”
Roughly two weeks ago, Ray signed an offer letter from a university, completing her extended search for a faculty position that began in June of last year, and had pulled her application from the university that later notified her of its hiring freeze. The timing had been perfect, she says, because she was able to travel for an in-person interview and negotiate her contract before universities starting closing their campuses. But on the morning of March 25, a day after she had received the emails about hiring freezes and canceled searches, Ray learned that the university where she had accepted an offer had issued its own hiring freeze. She immediately emailed the committee chair asking whether her position was under threat.
“I wasn’t left waiting too long,” Ray says, “but it was a brief moment of almost panic.” Her new job, she reports, is secure.

FDA to Allow for Plasma Therapy for COVID-19 Patients/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, P_WEI
A
mong the myriad clinical trials for vaccines to prevent COVID-19 and drugs to treat infections, doctors are looking to survivors’ plasma for a possible therapy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a statement on Tuesday (March 24) stating that investigators can request to use plasma from COVID-19 survivors to deliver antibodies to seriously ill patients, under an emergency investigational new drug (IND) protocol.
Convalescent plasma treatment, as it is known, has roots stretching back over 100 years. It is based on the premise that because a survivor developed antibodies throughout the course of their own infection, blood donations to those who became recently ill would give the recipients’ immune systems a leg up, reducing the severity of the disease and increasing the likelihood of survival. During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the rate of mortality decreased by as much as 50 percent among the patients who received the convalescent treatment, according to a meta-analysis of medical records available at that time and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2006.
To bring the treatment up to modern standards, plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 infection would be processed and purified, creating a serum to transfuse into critically ill patients.
“Deployment of this option requires no research or development,” Arturo Casadevall, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says in a statement. “It could be deployed within a couple of weeks since it relies on standard blood-banking practices.” 
In January, Casadevall and Liise-anne Pirofski of New York’s Montefiore Health System wrote in the Journal of Clinical Investigation that convalescent therapy could be used to curb COVID-19. They note that attempts to use convalescent therapies during outbreaks over the last 25 years, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and 2013 Ebola epidemic, were met with varying levels of success, possibly due to the plasma being administered when the patient was too far gone for it to help. Casadevall’s team recently received funding from Johns Hopkins, with a goal of performing these convalescent transfusions at the university’s Baltimore campus within a month.
See “Monkeys Develop Protective Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2”
While an eventual vaccine would ideally provide long-lasting immunity by spurring the recipient to create their own antibodies, receiving antibodies via the convalescent treatment would only form a temporary immunity, so multiple treatments would be required over the course of the illness, according to the Associated Press. 
“It must be given at the right time because it mops up the virus in the system and it just gives the new patient’s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it—but it has to be carefully time[d] and it’s not always successful,” Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program, tells STAT.
There are still details that need to be figured out in using convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment, including determining an effective dosing size. In its statement announcing the emergency IND access protocols, the FDA outlined standards for donor and recipient eligibility.
“Although promising,” the statement reads, “convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective in every disease studied. It is therefore important to determine through clinical trials, before routinely administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19, that it is safe and effective to do so.”
Proponents of the treatment have said that it could be very helpful to doctors and nurses on the frontlines, who face repeated exposure and whose absence from work would greatly affect public health, in addition to those who work in nursing homes, caring for people who are most at-risk of experiencing lethal complications from the infection.
“We need to be able to break the cycle of transmission and we also need to be able to help people who are ill,” Pirofski tells the Associated Press.
Plasma transfusions are commonplace nowadays, with patients receiving millions of donated units every year, but they are not without risks. Severe lung injury or allergic reactions can occur after receiving donor plasma.
To achieve similar results to transferring plasma with potentially fewer downsides, some biotech companies are developing antibodies to combat SARS-CoV-2. Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco is focusing its efforts on one particular antibody, STAT reports, though they have developed modifications to make the antibodies to last longer in the body. Vir reports that its drug might be ready for clinical trials as soon as this summer. If those go well, a treatment might be available in the fall.

Relatively Stable SARS-CoV-2 Genome Is Good News for a Vaccine/-/ABOVE: COVERT
T
he genome of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has remained relatively stable during its global spread, suggesting that a vaccine could confer long-term protection, according to The Washington Post. Although all replicating viruses accumulate some mutations that persist due to natural selection, the genetics of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that it is not mutating at a high rate, researchers report. They tell the Post that the virus’s proofreading machinery reduces both the rate of mutation and the error rate, and that no strains appear to be more dangerous than others.
There exist roughly four to 10 genetic differences between the origin virus from Wuhan and the strains currently circulating in the United States, molecular geneticist Peter Thielen of Johns Hopkins University tells the Post. “That’s a relatively small number of mutations for having passed through a large number of people,” he says. “At this point, the mutation rate of the virus would suggest that the vaccine developed for SARS-CoV-2 would be a single vaccine, rather than a new vaccine every year like the flu vaccine.” Thielen adds that the coronavirus vaccine might bear similarities to the vaccines for the measles or chickenpox, both of which offer long-lasting immunity.
“The virus has not mutated to any significant extent,” virologist Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa agrees in a comment to the Post.
See “Coronavirus’s Genetics Hint at its Cryptic Spread in Communities”
Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, pointed out key differences between the coronavirus and influenza. “Flu does have one trick up its sleeve that coronaviruses do not have—the flu virus genome is broken up into several segments, each of which codes for a gene,” he tells the newspaper. “When two flu viruses are in the same cell, they can swap some segments, potentially creating a new combination instantly—this is how the H1N1 ‘swine’ flu originated.” Neuman points out there is just one “pretty bad strain” of the coronavirus so far, but that if it persists for a year, more diversity may emerge.
According to the Post, scientists claim it’s possible that a small mutation in SARS-CoV-2 could have a large effect on clinical outcomes, though there are currently no signs of this occurring. Experts are now developing a number of vaccines against the novel coronavirus, which may become available within a year to 18 months.

Locally Made COVID-19 Tests Help Meet Demands/-/ABOVE: Kevin Hambourger, a medical lab technician at NorthShore University HealthSystem, which developed its own SARS-CoV-2 assays and is processing up to 600 patient samples a day, works under a fume hood.

A
fter several weeks’ delay caused by faulty testing kits and bureaucratic hurdles, regulatory guidelines for COVID-19 tests are rapidly loosening in the US and testing capability is ramping up on a national and local scale.
By January, many American clinicians and academic researchers had an eye on the viral outbreak in Wuhan, China, and contemplated setting up in-house testing for the new coronavirus. “We had the foresight in January to imagine that the ability to provide testing for COVID-19 would be important, and we worked hard to make that happen,” Benjamin Pinsky, an infectious disease expert at Stanford University School of Medicine, said in a press release March 16.
After the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted their official instructions for SARS-CoV-2 tests on January 28, clinical laboratories began preparing their own tests, modeled on the CDC’s instructions, in anticipation of eventual Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. In late February, when it became clear COVID-19 was more entrenched within the US than previously thought, public health department and academic labs began petitioning the FDA to let them start running their tests through Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
We were basically told, ‘we’ll worry about the costs later, go build capacity as fast as you can.’
—Keith Jerome, University of Washington
On February 29, the FDA issued a new policy: labs could start testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 before the FDA approved their EUA requests. Previously limited to CDC and state health departments, any laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to perform “high complexity tests” could start screening for the coronavirus, and the number of tests dramatically increased.
According to The COVID Tracking Project, led by The Atlantic journalist Alexis Madrigal, by March 23 a total of 294,056 SARS-CoV-2 tests were run in the US. On March 16, the number was only 41,714.
One of the fastest testing facilities out the gate is based in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine. On March 20, UW virologist Keith Jerome told The Scientist his lab was successfully running 3,000 tests per day, and intended to ramp up capacity to 4,000 or 5,000 this week. In contrast to the back and forth negotiation in February to accelerate the federal regulatory approval process, Jerome found his university supervisors supportive from his first conversations with them in January. “We were basically told, ‘we’ll worry about the costs later, go build capacity as fast as you can.’”
The CDC test protocol uses three primer and probe sets to detect three regions in the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.
UW Medicine has two testing protocols, one that targets two regions within the N gene, and the other that looks for the presence of two conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene.
See “How SARS-CoV-2 Tests Work and What’s Next in COVID-19 Diagnostics”
In addition to large laboratories processing thousands of samples a day on behalf of hospitals, many hospitals themselves have chosen to set up in-house COVID-19 testing. NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois was one of the first hospital systems to set up its own in-house test after the FDA announcement, and more have followed suit.
Karen Kaul, a molecular biologist at NorthShore who led the test development and validation, says her colleagues who’d worked through the 2009 swine flu pandemic saw the potential need for a test in January. NorthShore kept its test protocols identical to the CDC’s, hoping this would streamline the regulatory approval process.
“To perform tests in large volumes, you need systems that can get the results back out to the doctors, patients, and medical records. Hospitals and academic labs are set up to get this information,” Jerome notes.
NorthShore is currently testing up to 600 patients per day, but the test is only available to patients presenting with the most severe COVID-like symptoms. This testing capacity may be lowered by the nationwide shortages of reagents and basic laboratory supplies.
“There are shortages of everything throughout the whole process.” says Kaul. These shortages include personal protective equipment, pipette tips, viral transport media, and RNA extraction reagents. Her laboratory, and others around the country, set up multiple testing platforms made by different life science companies that they can toggle between if they run out of a particular reagent.
See “RNA Extraction Kits for COVID-19 Are in Short Supply in US”
State laboratories, academic labs, and hospitals were quick to begin rolling out small- to medium-scale assays, but shortly afterwards commercial testing companies unveiled the largest testing capabilities of all. On March 5, LabCorp began providing COVID-19 diagnostic tests, and Quest Diagnostics followed four days later. On March 19, LabCorp said in a statement it will be able to perform more than 20,000 COVID-19 tests per day beginning March 20, with a projected three- to four-day turnaround for results. Quest Diagnostics estimates it will achieve a similar throughput by the end of March.
Even though commercial testing capacity dwarfs that of hospitals and university labs, both testing options are necessary during a pandemic, says Kaul, who notes that an in-house COVID-19 test, which gives results within hours, is necessary so hospitals can triage sick patients. “If you’ve got a relatively healthy patient who is going to go home and self-isolate, they can probably wait a few days.” In that scenario, the hospital would prefer to save its limited in-house resources and send that sample out for commercial testing.
Right now, most testing laboratories are simply responding to the immediate testing shortages and gathering enough supplies to test the sickest patients for COVID-19. In the coming weeks, Jerome says, he hopes expanded capacity will allow UW to accept more healthcare clients in the Seattle area and start assisting with basic research aimed at understanding and combating the coronavirus.

Lost Smell and Taste Hint COVID-19 Can Target the Nervous System/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, RALWEL
N
early two weeks ago, Alessandro Laurenzi, a biologist working as a consultant in Bologna, Italy, was mowing the grass in his garden when a friend stopped him and said the mower reeked of fuel. “I couldn’t smell anything at all,” he tells The Scientist. That was in the morning. A few hours later, he went to have lunch and realized he couldn’t smell the food he was about to eat and when he took a bite, he couldn’t taste it either. Within a few days, he developed symptoms of COVID-19 and called his doctor to ask if he could get tested. Because his symptoms were mild, Laurenzi says, his doctor said no.
Laurenzi had heard anecdotally that many COVID-19 patients in Italy suffered from a loss of smell, so he started reading all the scientific papers he could find to see if his anosmia and ageusia would ever abate. One of the papers, a review published March 13, mentioned that SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, could target the central nervous system, possibly infecting neurons in the nasal passage and disrupting the senses of smell and taste. 
Some of the purely respiratory symptoms that you might attribute to the disease, the inability to get air into the lungs, might actually be defects in respiration controlled by the nervous system.
—Matthew Anderson, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
Reading this, Laurenzi immediately reached out to the corresponding author, Abdul Mannan Baig, a researcher at Aga Khan University in Pakistan, and asked if his symptoms were reversible. The evidence, Mannan told Laurenzi and reiterated to The Scientist, indicates they will abate, possibly because the loss of sense is caused by inflammation in the area as the body fights the virus, so those symptoms could disappear in seven to 14 days. “Let’s hope so,” Laurenzi tells The Scientist.
Documenting such peculiar symptoms is important, Mannan tells The Scientist, because the loss of smell and taste could be an early warning sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the literature, British ear, nose, and throat doctors have now called for adults who lost those senses to quarantine themselves in an attempt to tamp down the spread of the disease, The New York Times reports. The symptoms, Mannan adds, also suggest that the virus has the ability to invade the central nervous system, which could cause neurological damage and possibly play a role in patients dying from COVID-19.
“This is something to keep a careful eye on,” says Matthew Anderson, a neuropathologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “There’s been some intriguing observations in previous studies on viruses, including coronaviruses, to show that they have the capacity to enter the nervous system.” It’s important that this be considered for SARS-CoV-2 and for “people to do the experiments, including autopsies, to look for signs of this damage.”
How SARS-CoV-2 might infect nerve cells
Because COVID-19 has symptoms similar to the flu, “much of the attention could get diverted towards the pulmonary aspect of SARS-CoV-2, while neural involvement may remain covert,” Mannan says. When a patient begins to exhibit severe neurological symptoms, such as a loss of involuntary breathing, it may be “too late to prevent fatalities.”  
In a review article first published February 27, Yan-Chao Li of Jilin University in China and colleagues argue that if SARS-CoV-2 infects nerve cells, particularly neurons in the medulla oblongata, which is part of the brain stem that serves as the control center for the heart and the lungs, the damage could contribute to “acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19.” 
The epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that neurons in the medulla can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to a patient’s breathing problems and potential death. Li and colleagues explain that the time it takes for COVID-19 to progress from first symptoms to difficulty breathing is typically five days; patients are then admitted to the hospital roughly two days later, and a day after that put into intensive care. “The latency period is enough for the virus to enter and destroy the medullary neurons,” they write.
See “Can the Flu and Other Viruses Cause Neurodegeneration?”
SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells using a receptor called ACE2. Researchers have reported that ACE2 regulates cardiovascular function, and according to a search of protein databases, many human cell types express ACE2, including lung, heart, kidney, intestine, and brain tissue, Mannan says. There are also multiple ways that the virus could invade the central nervous system, he explains. It might circulate through the blood and then attack ACE2 receptors in the endothelia that lines blood capillaries in the brain, breaching the blood-brain barrier and invading neurons through that route. A breached blood-brain barrier could also cause brain swelling, compressing the brain stem and affecting respiration, Mannan says. The cells innervating the lungs could also become infected, making involuntary respiration more difficult.
Evidence from experiments in mice also suggest that the virus might target the nervous system through the olfactory bulb. In a 2008 study, immunologist Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa and colleagues showed that SARS-CoV—the virus that caused the SARS outbreak that killed more than 770 people in 2003—entered the brains of transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 through neurons in the nose. The virus then rapidly spread to connecting nerve cells. The extensive nerve damage was the major cause of death, the team reported, even though low levels of the virus were detected in the animals’ lungs. 
Although this has not been demonstrated, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially enter the nervous system through the olfactory bulb, as SARS-CoV does in mice.
WIKIMEDIA, PETER J. LYNCH
“Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla,” the team wrote. A study with the MERS virus in mice expressing ACE2 showed a similar result, Perlman tells The Scientist. “The brain certainly can be readily infected in mice,” he notes. “Whether this occurs in humans to any great extent is really unknown, but not very likely at this point,” given how much larger rodents’ olfactory bulbs are relative to the overall size of their brains compared with humans’ and the paucity of evidence in humans.
Still, he says, the fact that COVID-19 patients have lost their sense of smell or taste is interesting because, if the virus infects the nose, it would use the exact same neurons as in the mouse studies to enter the brain. If taking this path, SARS-CoV-2 could work its way up to the olfactory mucosa, which consists of epithelium cells, blood vessels, and the axons from olfactory neurons. “This area is connected to the olfactory bulb, via small, sieve-like, tiny openings called the cribriform plate that is located at the base of the frontal lobes of the brain,” Mannan explains. Because the brain’s frontal lobes are close to the olfactory bulb where neurons may be infected, the tissue deeper in the brain could be endangered too.
Infection of the brainstem could cause changes that would affect involuntary respiration, which suggests “some of the purely respiratory symptoms that you might attribute to the disease, the inability to get air into the lungs, might actually be defects in respiration controlled by the nervous system,” Anderson says.  
Implications of neurological infection by SARS-CoV-2
Mannan emphasizes that the neurological data on SARS-CoV-2, though preliminary, could be important for doctors deciding how to treat patients. Asking about neurological symptoms—loss of taste or smell, twitching, seizures—could factor into who might go into acute respiratory failure, or at least who might suffer from it soonest, and allow for more efficient triaging of patients, with a close eye kept on those with neurological symptoms. “It is important to screen the patients for neurological signs early and late in the course of COVID-19,” he says, “as this could be life-saving in our fight against COVID-19 pandemic.”
Anderson and Perlman add that postmortem examinations of the brains of patients who died from COVID-19 are essential to understanding the role nerve damage might play in the progression of the disease. Few, if any, autopsies of these patients are being done because of fear of contracting the disease, and if the autopsies are being done, it’s not likely that examiners are looking at the brain, only the lungs. “They’re just not thinking that the brain could be the site of the problem,” Anderson says, “and so that’s the really important aspect of these reviews, getting that idea out there.”

After Conference Cancellations, Some Scientists Find a Way/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SCHARVIK
W
ithin a matter of weeks, COVID-19 changed the world. Borders are sealed, schools and businesses shuttered, and millions of people are hunkered down in their homes. The spread of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has forced cancellations across almost every sector of society, including sports competitions, weddings, trade fairs, and music and film festivals. Academia has not been spared. In the face of the pandemic, scientific conferences have quickly morphed from a place to share ideas and make new connections to potential hotspots of infection.
In the life sciences alone, dozens of meetings have been canceled, postponed, or moved online. Some researchers have planned online replacements. Many are worried about broader disruptions to academic life.
See “Life Science Conference Disruptions Due to Coronavirus”
Lost opportunities
For many scientists, these conferences are a chance to share research, learn new skills, and meet future supervisors, students, and collaborators. Aadel Chaudhuri, a professor of radiation oncology at the Washington University School of Medicine, has a lab that’s only a year-and-a-half old—and two graduate students and a postdoc were planning to present their work at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting in April in San Diego. So the announcement that the spring gathering was postponed was disappointing news, he tells The Scientist.
If [virtual events] become normalized through this crisis, I think that will be really positive moving forward.
—Rebekah Oomen, University of Oslo 
Not being able to attend that meeting would be “a detriment to our ability to communicate our science and present to a broader audience and develop meaningful collaborations,” he says. “I’m in an area that’s very translational and we kind of rely on this type of communication to advance our field forward.” However, Chaudhuri adds, conference cancellations are not a bigger deal than everything else getting canceled across the academic sector—from classes to commencements. Because AACR plans to hold the conference later this year, Chaudhuri says he hopes that his group will still have an opportunity to present their work.
Emily Roycroft, a PhD student at the University of Melbourne who had planned to attend the now-canceled Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE) meeting this summer, notes that while she’s lucky to have a postdoc position already secured, for many researchers, conferences are a chance for students and early-career researchers to make connections and find out about open positions. “The cancellation of conferences makes developing these connections harder,” she writes in an email to The Scientist. “But more broadly, I fear that the current global uncertainty means that many hiring opportunities could go on hold.”
Virtual replacements
A handful of conferences, including those organized by ENDO, AACR, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, will occur either partially—or entirely—online. In cases where such substitutes don’t exist, some researchers have been planning their own.
When Matthew Helgeson, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, heard that the American Chemical Society’s March meeting in Philadelphia was canceled, he and his colleagues immediately started planning a virtual replacement. “The hope was that we could more or less recreate as much of the in-person programming as we could,” he says.
Over the span of about two weeks, the team was able to organize the virtual program. Although logistical issues—time zone difference for attendees in Asia, for example—meant some of the original speakers would be unable to participate, “we ended up with quite a big fraction of the original program,” according to Helgeson. The meeting spans three days during which the in-person conference had been scheduled. It includes 23 symposia—attendees can choose to join several simultaneous presentations delivered via Zoom—and a virtual poster session on Twitter, where presenters can share their work under the hashtag #ACSCOLLPoster.
Rebekah Oomen, a postdoc at the University of Oslo, was organizing a symposium for SMBE in hopes of creating a new network of researchers. “I feel I’ve definitely lost this huge opportunity,” she tells The Scientist. “My research is going into a sort of new area and I need to find my community.” To make up for this loss, Oomen plans to organize an online replacement for the symposium.
According to Roycroft, a number of societies are currently asking for feedback from members about how best to deliver online alternatives—and early ideas include online symposia, e-posters, and virtual networking sessions. “When things eventually calm down, it would be great to see the development of these ideas more,” she adds. “I think right now, everyone is quite distracted with the current circumstances.”
These virtual replacements are the silver lining of cancellations, according to Oomen. “People with accessibility issues and people that are concerned about the climate have been pushing for these options for a long time,” she says. “If [virtual events] become normalized through this crisis, I think that will be really positive moving forward.”

Research interrupted  
For many researchers, a canceled conference is just one of many problems they are currently facing. Not being able to go into the lab has means that scientists need to find workarounds or put their experiments on hold.
I traveled to the United States just to learn this technique. Now, I’m doing just doing paperwork.
—Jeann Sabino-Carvalho, University of Brasília
Since early last week, Oomen has been unable to be onsite at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway where she’s been examining the reproductive biology and behavior in cod. Postponing the study would mean waiting until spawning season returns next year, so she’s continuing the work via a technician—one of the few people who is still allowed onsite. “I have to just communicate with that person for several hours over the phone to instruct them,” she says. “It’s a bit stressful to not be able to do things as you did before and have the help that we need and, at the same time, try to not let everything just be wasted, go out the window, because you have to shut down.”
Continuing studies from a distance isn’t an option for everyone. “I’ve heard from a lot of researchers who are either having to completely cancel their experiments or downscale them to a bare minimum,” she tells The Scientist. “I think very little research is going in full scale as planned.”
Jeann Sabino-Carvalho, a PhD student at the University of Brasília in Brazil, arrived at Iowa State University in February as a visiting scholar to learn a new method for studying neural circuits in human subjects. He arrived in February and had only planned to stay until May—but because of the coronavirus, he’s unable to do this work. “I traveled to the United States just to learn this technique,” he says. “Now, I’m doing just doing paperwork.”
For some, conference cancellations have been overshadowed by COVID-19’s more widespread effects. Jason Tan Liwag, a master’s student in molecular biology at the University of Philippines Diliman, says that the Endocrine Society’s (ENDO) March meeting in San Francisco, which was canceled earlier this month, would have provided an opportunity to meet other scientists face-to-face, learn what graduate school abroad might look like, and gain a holistic view of the current research landscape. “It’s devastating to not be able to not have been granted that [opportunity],” he says. “At the same time, with the ongoing crisis, career is one of the few things that are on our minds at the moment.”
Clarification (March 24): The article has been updated to indicate that Rebekah Oomen is unable to be onsite at the Institute of Marine Research because of the current coronovirus outbreak.

Opinion: Stop Private Speculation in COVID-19 Research/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ANYAIVANOVA
T
he crisis triggered by the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus requires immediate leaps forward in economic policy strategies. In a document published in the Financial Times on March 13 we have underlined the urgency of international coordination to implement an immediate “anti-virus” plan in three points: immediate control of capital markets to counter speculation, public investments in health care and research, and interventions to remedy possible “disorganization” in the markets that could create bottlenecks in production and difficulties in supplying goods and services even beyond the health care sector.
Sharing scientific and technical knowledge publicly means winning the battle against the virus.
One aspect of this public planning seems particularly urgent to us. It is necessary to denounce the behavior of private agents driven by a profit motive who are causing slowdowns in research against the virus. There are private companies that announce impending discoveries in vaccine research everyday, and in this way they see their stock market values explode. There are other companies that already have knowledge that could be useful in the fight against the pandemic, but are waiting to make it available to the best bidders.
We argue that these speculations hinder research and must be stopped immediately. Public authorities must remedy these “market failures” by ensuring maximum collective sharing of the scientific knowledge necessary to tackle the ongoing pandemic. Some recent proposals around the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) seem to be moving in this direction, and in other countries the problem is being examined, but the action is too slow and seems to be vitiated by a privatized approach to drug development that is now obsolete in the face of the crisis.
In our view, five policy actions are urgent:
A public purchase is needed to make available for free to the international scientific community all intellectual property rights directly or indirectly inherent in research associated with the fight against the coronavirus.
It is necessary to establish a system of public rewards for all researchers who share their knowledge, even partial, in the battle against the virus.
New restrictive patents and any secrecy related to the fight against the virus should be strongly discouraged by imposing new taxation on intellectual property rights.
An international public research agency should be set up in order to better coordinate scientists and increase the speed and effectiveness of new research.
This international effort can be financed with the issue of corona-bonds directly purchased by central banks, for a percentage equal to a quarter point of GDP of each advanced country.
The more-comprehensive the international coordination of these actions, the better the results will be. We can therefore ideally act within the framework of the United Nations institutions and also through the establishment of a World Research Organization (WRO) for the regulation of transactions between countries. In the absence of global coordination, it will be necessary to act for the widest possible multi-lateral agreements with those countries that participate. Any free-riding behavior by private institutions or authorities of individual countries in which they exploit the effort occurring in public research and open science for the purpose of profit-making patents will have to be judged as an act of “unfair competition.” Such behavior should be monitored and sanctioned even with the reprisals already admitted by the current international trade agreements.
This is a huge collective challenge, which affects health, science, technology, and economics. It is also a struggle against outdated ideas and pre-established private interests. Sharing scientific and technical knowledge publicly means winning the battle against the virus. Anyone who irresponsibly decides to play privately as a free-rider will have to be reported and isolated.

Chloroquine for COVID-19: Cutting Through the Hype/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, OLLAWEILA
O
n March 16, SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine was “maybe worth considering” as a treatment for COVID-19. He got 13,000 retweets. By March 19, President Donald Trump was touting chloroquine at a press conference. He even announced that the Food and Drug Administration had fast-tracked its approval for COVID-19. The FDA denied that this was the case a short time later.
While some of the hype has been fuelled by a document generated outside the scientific literature, chloroquine’s potential in treating COVID-19 is gaining traction in the medical community. 
The drug has a long track record in medicine, having been used since the 1940s as an antimalarial. The modern drug is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found in the bark of the Cinchona plant. The plant was taken as an herbal remedy by indigenous Peruvians four centuries ago to treat fever. And there are some early indications it could work against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
There’s often a huge gap between how it works in the lab cells and how it works in the body.
—Jeremy Rossman, University of Kent
For instance, a study in France published on March 20 in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents described the treatment of 42 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 26 of whom received a version of chloroquine called hydroxychloroquine and 16 of whom received routine care. Of the 20 patients who took the antimalarial and completed the study, six also received azithromycin, an antibiotic. All six of these patients were free of SARS-CoV-2 by the fifth day post-treatment, while seven of 14 patients who took hydroxychloroquine alone were negative for the virus, and two of 16 control patients were no longer infected.
Small-scale experiments in which chloroquine has been given to COVID-19 patients in China and Australia have also shown encouraging results as far as shortening the course of the disease.
Larger clinical trials will be necessary to determine how effective the drug is. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have embarked on a study including 1,500 people to probe the drug’s effectiveness further in preventing the development of COVID-19 after people are exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The results could be available in a matter of weeks, Jakub Tolar, the dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and vice president for clinical affairs, tells Reuters, and might indicate whether it’s worth launching a larger trial.
A small trial of 1,500 people would be a pragmatic step towards verifying the drug’s efficacy, says Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent, who praises the approach. 
A number of other chloroquine experiments on humans are in the works. According to clinicaltrials.gov, researchers at the University of Oxford plan to give it as a prophylactic to 10,000 health care workers and others at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In Norway, doctors expect to begin administering the drug to hospitalized patients. And in Thailand, clinicians are preparing for a clinical trial comparing various combinations of antivirals, including chloroquine.
Chloroquine’s mechanism of action
If chloroquine is shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, it will not be via the same mechanism by which the drug functions as an antimalarial. That’s because malaria is caused not by a virus but by a microparasite of the Plasmodium genus. Chloroquine makes it toxic for the parasite to digest its host’s hemoglobin. 
Chloroquine might have entirely different effects against a virus, such as, for example, disrupting the virus’s ability to enter a cell. 
See “Are We Headed for a New Era of Malaria Drug Resistance?”
Nabil Seidah, a molecular biologist at the Montreal Clinical Research Institute (IRCM), and colleagues examined chloroquine’s effect on SARS-CoV back in 2005. Seidah is currently experimenting with drugs including chloroquine as potential SARS-CoV-2 treatments and using material sent to him by pharmaceutical firms.
His 2005 study reported “strong antiviral effects” in animal cells in vitro. Seidah tells The Scientist that the mechanism by which chloroquine disrupts infection by a coronavirus remains unclear.
Chloroquine can raise the pH of endosomes, vesicles inside cells that are hijacked as points of entry by viruses. Endosomes have a slightly acidic pH, which helps facilitate this process. Seidah explains that chloroquine can raise endosomic pH slightly, which prevents fusion and stops the virus from entering the cell. Seidah says chloroquine may also block enzymes involved in the fusion between the virus and lung cells or stymie the viral replication process. 
Whatever the mechanism, Seidah says, it’s likely a combination of drugs of some kind that will, ultimately, be needed to treat COVID-19.
“Chloroquine alone will not solve the problem,” he says.
Rossman says he would expect chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the lab, based on what is known about its ability to raise endosomic pH. “But there’s often a huge gap between how it works in the lab cells and how it works in the body,” he says.
The drug is potentially dangerous when used at high doses or for prolonged periods. It can cause permanent blindness and even death. Rossman and Seidah agree that larger clinical trials are a must before chloroquine is considered safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19. 
Correction (March 23): The article originally stated chloroquine is made from Cinchona bark, but it is a synthetic compound. The Scientist regrets the error.

Border Closing Strands Professors, Students in Peru/-/ABOVE: A photo taken from Brian Enquist’s hotel room shows the empty streets of Cusco.
BRIAN ENQUIST
Update (March 27): Members of the course who are US citizens or permanent residents left Peru yesterday on a charter flight arranged by the US State Department. Enquist says a few students from other countries are still in Cusco, and that instructors continue to try to make arrangements to get them out.
A
rgentina, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala have all closed their borders to foreigners in an effort to contain COVID-19, Buzzfeed News reports, halting both inbound and outbound trips and stranding hundreds of travelers in Latin America. Among them are a multinational group of 27 students and professors involved in a course on studying how plant traits are changing as a result of climate change and fire, which had been slated to run from March 9–22 near Manú National Park, a three-hour trip from Cusco.
The course, jointly organized by the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Bergen in Norway, had been in the works for about a year, says Brian Enquist, a UA plant biologist and ecologist who’s among the group stuck in Peru. When the class traveled to the country in early March, there were no established cases of COVID-19 in Peru, and no travel restrictions or warnings about the country, he notes in a message, and the course leaders “felt a responsibility to deliver the course we had been committed to” for a long time. 
The course originally included 45 graduate students, postdocs, and professors from all over the world. Late last week, Enquist says, they heard from the Peruvian government that travel to and from Europe was going to stop, so Europeans in the course scrambled to leave early. A few days later, on Sunday (March 15), Enquist says, one of his Peruvian colleagues told him the country’s president was set to give a speech later that day in which he’d declare a state of emergency. Without knowing what restrictions that might entail, “immediately we started to pack up . . . just in case we had to leave the [field] station in order to try to get to Cusco,” Enquist tells The Scientist. 
Members of the class measured carbon and water fluxes in the Andes before the border closure was announced.
BRIAN ENQUIST
In the speech, President Martín Vizcarra said the borders would be closed a day later, at midnight on Tuesday, March 17, for 15 days. Enquist and the remaining members of the group headed for Cusco and looked for a way out of the country from there. The Europeans and a few other members of the group were able to get flights out on Monday. UA tried to arrange a charter flight for those who weren’t able to get commercial flights before the closure, he says, but the logistics couldn’t be worked out in time. Some in the group had rebooked tickets on flights slated to leave shortly after midnight on Tuesday—but those flights were canceled. “It was pretty dramatic and sudden,” Enquist says.
Since then, the remaining 27 members of the group have been confined to a hotel in Cusco, where residents and travelers aren’t allowed out except to visit pharmacies or shop for food. But they’ve kept busy, Enquist says, with professors continuing to teach the students, and one member leading yoga sessions.
Organizing logistics has also been time-consuming, Enquist says, particularly as some commercial airlines have suspended planned flights beyond the end of the border closing. Members of the group are seeking help from their governments and institutions to try to get home, while also keeping their friends and families up to date on their situation.
Even as he copes with the uncertainty of being stranded far from home during a pandemic, Enquist says the group is fortunate to “have each other, a nice place to stay, and good food.” Answering the scientific questions they’re interested in, he says, “requires crossing borders and interacting with the networks of scientists and students from across the world . . . because of that, we can sometimes get stuck in situations like this.”

Remdesivir Works Against Coronaviruses in the Lab/-/ABOVE: ©ISTOCK.COM,
DESIGN CELLS
T
argeted drug development takes years, but when time is short in a pandemic, scientists and clinicians turn to pharmaceuticals that have been used to treat other diseases. In rapid fashion, doctors have already deployed a number of antivirals in attempts to fight back against COVID-19 and data from their studies are now coming in. So far, trials of existing antivirals have largely focused on the drug combination lopinavir-ritonavir, which are two Food and Drug Administration­–approved HIV protease inhibitors, and remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat the Ebola virus and is not yet FDA approved. 
The latest study to report back from the frontlines of the pandemic has been disappointing. The results of a randomized trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in 199 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, that were published this week (March 18) revealed no benefit in terms of time to clinical improvement in the patients who received the drug combo versus a placebo. The findings are consistent with a study published in January this year that showed a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon beta did not reduce lung injury a mouse model of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and only reduced virus levels in the lungs modestly in one of two experiments.
In that same study, remdesivir was much better at inhibiting the coronavirus that causes MERS in cell culture and improving respiratory symptoms in the animals, indicating that it may be a better option for treating SARS-CoV-2.
Lopinavir and ritonavir are both protease inhibitors developed specifically to treat HIV. Remdesivir, on the other hand, is a broad-spectrum antiviral. It was initially developed to treat Ebola, but it is a nucleotide analog that mimics adenosine, one of the building blocks of any RNA virus’s genome. Drugs that act as nucleotide analogs interfere with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the enzyme that viruses use to copy their genomes, says Matthias Götte, a biochemist at the University of Alberta. “If you target this enzyme the virus cannot replicate anymore, so it’s a very logical target to begin with.”
We’ve done a lot of work in coronaviruses with remdesivir, but the big question is: does all of that data that we’ve generated in SARS and in MERS and in MHV, our model coronavirus, does that translate to this new virus?
—Maria Agostini, Vanderbilt University
There are three ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials at locations across China and the United States for remdesivir, which is manufactured by pharmaceutical company Gilead. Doctors in the US have also treated patients with the drug under the Food and Drug Administration’s compassionate use policy, and—while it’s not clear that it was because of remdesivir treatment—at least one patient recovered.
Remdesivir has shown promise disabling coronaviruses in the lab, too. Researchers led by Vanderbilt University’s Mark Denison and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Ralph Baric showed in 2017 that remdesivir (then known as GS-5734) could inhibit replication of the coronaviruses that cause both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS in human lung cells. The authors also found that the drug reduced viral load and improved respiratory function in a mouse model of SARS. A year later, members of the same research team published another study showing that remdesivir’s effectiveness relies on coronaviruses having an intact RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
“We were looking for compounds that could broadly inhibit coronaviruses and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is, if not the most conserved protein in coronaviruses, definitely within the top two, so that makes it a good target for broad-spectrum antivirals,” says Maria Agostini, a postdoc in the Denison lab.
New work Götte and colleagues published on February 24 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry indicates that the drug, which they refer to an as an analog inhibitor, exerts these effects on the MERS coronavirus polymerase via delayed RNA chain termination. This means that when the viral polymerase incorporates the analog instead of the natural nucleotide, it adds three more nucleotides and then stops. When it can’t copy its genome, the virus can’t reproduce and make its host sick. They hypothesize that the extra three nucleotides may protect the drug from being removed by the coronavirus’s exonuclease enzyme.
In the same study, the researchers found that the MERS polymerase incorporated the mimic at a greater frequency than the natural nucleotide. This is in contrast to the Ebola polymerase, which they showed in 2019 selects adenosine triphosphate about four times as often as remdesivir.
“The more often the inhibitor is utilized instead of the natural counterpart, the more chances you have for effective inhibition. A prerequisite for inhibition is that the inhibitor needs to get into the newly synthesized RNA, and the fact that these MERS polymerases are sloppy and cannot really distinguish very well between the natural counterpart and the inhibitor, that’s an advantage,” explains Götte.
His team has already started looking into how the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase interacts with the drug. This work and animal and cell culture studies from other groups that show potent inhibition of MERS with remdesivir have Götte feeling “cautiously optimistic” that remdesivir might work for SARS-CoV-2, but there are still plenty of open questions. And other scientists have also begun to investigate the effects of remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2. In a letter published in Cell Research on February 4, remdesivir blocked coronavirus infection in monkey and human cells.
“We’ve done a lot of work in coronaviruses with remdesivir, but the big question is: does all of that data that we’ve generated in SARS and in MERS and in MHV, our model coronavirus, does that translate to this new virus?” asks Agostini. She points to the positive results of the Cell Research study, “but whether that holds true in animals and ultimately whether that holds true in people, we still have to do the experiments.”

Opinion: Grad Students Face Uncertainty During the Pandemic/-/ABOVE: LILA WESTREICH
A
month ago, my life as a graduate student at the University of Washington was going well. I was scheduled to give five public talks on my research during the first week of March, my laboratory experiments were proceeding apace, and I was prepping for fieldwork set to start in a few weeks. Then everything changed.
On March 4th, public health officials in King County, WA, responding to the growing outbreak and increasing number of cases of COVID-19 in the state, announced during a press conference that Seattle residents should stay home. The King County Department of Public Health officials also advised the cancellation of any group event involving more than 10 people. My scheduled presentations were canceled almost immediately. The University of Washington (UW) quickly shifted to online classes. Toilet paper and hand sanitizer disappeared from grocery shelves across the city. Graduate students were left stranded.
As a graduate student, I am responsible for teaching classes while completing my own research. Teaching funds my graduate career, by allowing me to earn a stipend, tuition, and healthcare benefits in exchange for my time and effort. But even in the best economic times, these stipends often aren’t enough to cover living expenses, especially in a city as expensive as Seattle. Many graduate students work other jobs to pay the rent. Graduate students tutor undergraduates, proctor exams, and work retail and service industry jobs. With in-person classes canceled and restaurants closing, graduate students are losing vital sources of income. We already face food and housing insecurity, as do graduate students across the country. What will happen when our financial situation gets worse?
At UW, graduate student workers are ineligible to accumulate paid sick time. If we get sick, we stay home—but the lab time we miss must be made up with late nights and weekend work. With the move to online classes and UW’s recommended self-isolation guidelines, grad students are uncertain about their research, their financial and mental wellbeing, and their futures.
Students whose research can be done remotely worry about the effects of prolonged isolation from friends and coworkers on their mental health. Emotional effects, such as difficulty focusing on work and maintaining productivity, are likely to set in if in-person classes are canceled for much longer. Grad students defending theses have been forced to give final presentations to empty rooms, with professors joining through video conferencing. Students working in labs are choosing not to quarantine, mainly because many life-science experiments require constant observation. In addition to these disruptions, numerous graduate students rely on undergraduates to help collect data. With undergraduate students urged to stay home, graduate students relying on continuous data flow are forced to make up for the loss of assistants, skyrocketing stress levels and lengthening research timelines. These students don’t always have the option to self-isolate without sacrificing data collection, even when the Public Health Department explicitly recommends staying home.
I am lucky that my samples—pollen foraged by native bees in Washington that I analyze genetically—are collected locally in remote fields of wildflowers or public parks.  For graduate students who must travel internationally to collect samples and data, UW guidelines have forced them to cancel or reschedule in hopes the virus will diminish before the field season ends at the start of next winter. Graduate students traveling domestically are forced to make their own decision on whether to stay or go, risking their health and potentially contributing to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to complete their projects, or canceling their trips and postponing graduation or missing funding deadlines.
If I catch the virus, I can self-isolate. But if I were quarantined, I would be unable to perform the necessary tasks and experiments to complete my doctoral degree on time—a reality many graduate students are facing in the coming months in Seattle and beyond. Our work won’t get done without us, and our funding deadlines aren’t likely to change just because the world has been plunged into pandemic turmoil. We don’t have the financial or job stability to navigate a crisis. With the number of infections forecasted to grow in Seattle and across the country, universities, academic administrations, and funding sources need to start making a plan and addressing the uncertainty confronting graduate students. Creating a source of bridge funding for graduate students during the pandemic to allow them to self-isolate without repercussions on their research is a good start.

US Primate Centers Work to Protect Animals from COVID-19/-/ABOVE: ©ISTOCK.COM, DC_COLOMBIA
E
arlier this month, the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis, canceled its tours, turned visitors away, and restricted students’ access to many areas of the facility. Researchers even limited the movements of the animals in the colony, all with the goal of protecting the animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Like humans, monkeys are vulnerable to the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, although their symptoms are not entirely the same. This has opened up opportunities to study SARS-CoV-2, but has also meant facilities need to institute extensive precautions to prevent unintended contagion, particularly now as the researchers plan nonhuman primate experiments to aid in the development of coronavirus treatments and vaccines. 
The level of risk primates face at these facilities is not well known. Investigators in China have shown that rhesus macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV2. “The animals did not demonstrate clinical signs [of infection] but were shown to have pneumonia,” Jeffrey Roberts, the associate director of the California National Primate Research Center, writes in an email to The Scientist. “We have a population of 4,000 rhesus macaques and 100 titi monkeys and our concern is that, similar to the human population, a subset or our animal colony may become clinically ill and in the case of our aged rhesus colony, severely so.” So far, initial antibody testing for signs of the virus in the California colony has been negative.
If we wanted to test the efficacy of a vaccine and the animals have already been exposed [to the virus] and gotten over [an infection], you can’t infect them, so you couldn’t tell whether the vaccine’s protective.
—Skip Bohm, Tulane National Primate Research Center
Keeping the virus out of primate colonies across the country will be essential for SARS-CoV-2 research, Roberts and other center officials say. Once an animal has been infected, it can’t be used for research, so any colony outbreak would severely limit the number of animals available for COVID-19 experiments.
At the Washington National Primate Research Center in Seattle, the standard protocol for researchers is to wear face masks, face shields, hair nets, two sets of protective gloves, Tyvek suits, and booties over their shoes whenever they go into an area where animals are housed. The intent is to prevent the monkeys there—rhesus macaques, pigtail macaques, long-tailed macaques, and squirrel monkeys—from contracting infections of any kind. 
Because of the precautions, the animals at the Washington site are fairly well protected from accidentally contracting SARS-CoV-2 from humans, says Sally Thompson-Iritani, the interim director of the facility, but there’s nothing known about how different primate species respond to the virus. Each species could be “differentially susceptible,” she says. “That’s something we are very aware of and we’re really monitoring each species independently.”
The facility is also taking additional precautions beyond the standard protocol of protective gear. “We’re limiting the number of people who are coming to work every day because we want to ensure that we’re limiting exposure between people, which then limits exposure to the animals,” Thompson-Iritani says.
Although all of the animals at the primate centers are at risk, some may be more vulnerable than others based on the different types of research programs run at each center, notes Skip Bohm, the associate director and chief veterinary medical officer at the Tulane National Primate Research Center. The California and Tulane sites, for example, have large, outdoor breeding colonies. At the California center, undergraduate and graduate students help with behavioral experiments, and until recently, were at the facility observing the animals and collecting data for behavior research projects. Because of the increased access to the animals there, they might have been at a higher risk of exposure compared with the Tulane facility where research focuses largely on infectious disease and so students and investigators from the university do not have access to the animals there.
At Tulane, similar to Washington, animal care workers, veterinarians, and behavioral management staff who come in contact with the outdoor colony wear protective gear when working with the animals, but the risk that the animals could contract SARS-CoV-2 remains. As a result, the facility may begin monitoring the health of its employees and will perform antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 to detect if animals have unintentionally contracted the virus at any point.
This monitoring effort is principally important now, Bohm says, because next week the center will begin COVID-19 experiments in nonhuman primates. In the first experiment, the team will confirm that the animals—two rhesus macaques and two African Green monkeys—can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. “If you want to test treatments and vaccines, you have to be sure the animals can be infected,” Bohm says. 
See “Monkeys Develop Protective Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2”
A preliminary study from China shows rhesus macaques can be infected but don’t develop the infection a second time they are exposed to it. Although the data are preliminary, it’s a good sign that perhaps people are most likely protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infections, at least in the short term. It’s not so great for running COVID-19 experiments in primates. “If we wanted to test the efficacy of a vaccine and the animals have already been exposed [to the virus] and gotten over [an infection], you can’t infect them, so you couldn’t tell whether the vaccine’s protective,” Bohm says. “You couldn’t do drug treatment studies to see if you could cure the disease because you couldn’t infect [the animals].” Maintaining the health of the colonies, he notes, is critically important now so those studies can be done.

University of Washington Pathology Professor Dies of COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SEASTOCK
L
ongtime University of Washington faculty member Stephen Schwartz died on Tuesday (March 17) from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the Seattle Times reports.
“We are deeply saddened that faculty member Professor Stephen Schwartz passed away due to a COVID-19 infection,” the University of Washington Department of Pathology tweeted yesterday (March 18) afternoon. “He has left a lasting imprint on our department, our university, and the broader scientific community and will be greatly missed.”
UW MEDICINE
Schwartz spent his career at the University of Washington (UW), starting with his residency in the Department of Pathology from 1967 to 1972. He joined the faculty a year later as an assistant professor, and became a full professor in 1984.
Charles Alpers, interim chair of the pathology department, shared the news with the UW faculty yesterday in an email. “Steve had a distinguished career as an investigator in the field of vascular biology,” Alpers wrote, according to the Times. “He is rightfully considered a giant amongst investigators of the biology of smooth muscle cells and the structure of blood vessels.”
“He will be sorely missed by generations of vascular biologists and pathologists,” Bernadette Englert, executive officer of the North American Vascular Biology Organization, which Schwartz cofounded, writes on the society’s website.
In addition to his appointment in the pathology department, Schwartz was an adjunct professor in the bioengineering and medicine departments, which Alpers says was “reflective of his many collaborative relationships with faculty and other departments in our medical school and in the world.”
UW’s student newspaper, The Daily, reports that Schwartz’s death appears to be the first COVID-19-related death tied to UW.
“Stephen Schwartz was a giant in vascular biology and a mentor to countless faculty and trainees, including myself,” UW biologist Kelly Stevens tweeted. “He will be deeply missed.”

Governments Must Ramp Up COVID-19 Testing, Says WHO/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, PRILL 
T
he World Health Organization is urging governments to perform more tests for COVID-19 following concerns about underreporting of cases in many countries around the globe. As the number of confirmed deaths due to infections with SARS-CoV-2 passed 8,000 this week, more and more nations have introduced strict measures to attempt to delay the virus’s spread, but the organization warns that assessing the impact of these measures will only be possible with accurate data on the disease.
The message to every government and health authority on the planet right now is “get the capacity, and test, test, test,” Margaret Harris of the WHO coronavirus response team tells Sky News. “If you don’t know you’ve got a fire, you can’t put it out.”
See “How SARS-CoV-2 Tests Work and What’s Next in COVID-19 Diagnostics”
Some countries have been taking a proactive approach to testing. South Korea, which has a population of more than 51 million people, rapidly implemented the largest testing program in the world after cases began soaring in February, screening people who had any contact with infected individuals as well as anyone with symptoms, and setting up drive-through testing sites.
According to Our World in Data, a project run by researchers at the University of Oxford in the UK, South Korea has so far carried out more than 285,000 tests—the equivalent of 5,500 tests for every million people in the population. With the national number of COVID-19 cases stabilizing at around 8,400, South Korea’s experience shows that “diagnostic capacity at scale is key to epidemic control,” Raina MacIntyre, an emerging infectious disease scholar at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, tells Science.
South Korea is now sending testing kits to other parts of the world. The Korea Times reported yesterday (March 17) that more than 50,000 tests had been exported to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a country of around 9.5 million people that is overseeing a largescale testing operation for COVID-19 among its population. Bahrain and Iceland, which have populations of around 1.5 million and 350,000 respectively, are also working on screening large numbers of people.
Estimates of the number of tests carried out in each country are based on reports from March 16 or March 17 for all countries except India, which last updated its test numbers on March 13.
DATA FROM OUR WORLD IN DATA
Many other countries have taken a less exhaustive approach. The UK, for example, announced at a press conference last week that it would only test people who were admitted to hospitals—a move criticized by many researchers and health workers, The Guardian reports. As of Tuesday, the country had carried out around 50,000 tests—fewer than 750 tests per million people in the population. Doctors and other staff working at National Health Service hospitals are not being tested even if they have symptoms, according to The Guardian. 
Tim Colbourn, a global health epidemiologist at University College London, told the Financial Times earlier this week that the UK should “follow World Health Organization advice and do massive testing and tracing, as well as social distancing.” Restricting tests to hospitalized patients would make it “difficult to understand how many people are infected and what the likely burden on the health system will be in the coming week.”
Health workers in the US have also raised concerns about undertesting. According to Our World in Data, state health organizations and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have collectively tested about 41,500 people, or around 125 per million people in the population.
Estimates of the number of tests carried out in each country are based on reports from March 16 or March 17 for all countries except India, which last updated its test numbers on March 13.
TESTING DATA FROM OUR WORLD IN DATA, CASE DATA FROM ECDC
The total number of tests carried out in the US when private companies are taken into account is likely to be larger, although that’s impossible to know for sure, because private companies are only required to report positive COVID-19 tests; the number of tests that came back negative is unavailable in many US states.
A statement from the WHO on March 16 noted that a total of 1.5 million tests had been sent out to 120 countries. Those countries do not include the US, which has chosen to pursue its own testing technologies, according to CNN. Several states are currently reporting shortages of testing kits and supplies.
See “RNA Extraction Kits for COVID-19 Tests Are In Short Supply In US”
India, which is reporting fewer than 150 cases of COVID-19, has refused to scale up its testing programs on the grounds that spread of disease has been less severe there than elsewhere. By the end of last week, the country had carried out fewer than 6,000 tests for COVID-19, a testing rate equivalent to just 4.3 tests per million people in the population. The WHO guidance is “premature” for India, Balaram Bharghava, who heads the Indian Council of Medical Research, tells Al Jazeera, adding that there hadn’t yet been reports of community transmission. The call for widespread testing “creates more fear, more paranoia, and more hype.” 
But researchers in India, which has a population of 1.34 billion, have expressed skepticism about the claims. “Given the pattern of disease in other places, and given our low level of testing,” Gagandeep Kang, director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, tells Al Jazeera, “then I do think that community transmission is happening.”

Coronavirus’s Effect on Autism Research May Have Lasting Effects/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LEAH613
T
he coronavirus pandemic has shuttered universities and institutes, leaving scientists scrambling to continue their research.
Hundreds of colleges and universities in the United States have dispatched students home and are aiming to transition to remote learning. Scientific organizations are canceling conferences or moving them online. And scientists have had to put research projects and clinical trials on hold.
These decisions—all done with the intention of slowing the pandemic—may stall and stymie research, with long-term consequences for the field. It may also hurt career prospects for graduate students who rely on conference presentations to gain exposure.
The long-term work needs not to be stopped, because otherwise this is going to be a real disaster, and we’ll lose a year of work at least.
—Gaia Novarino, Institute of Science and Technology in Klosterneuburg 
“From everything that we’re seeing, this isn’t like a two-week hiatus,” says Helen Egger, chair of the child and adolescent psychiatry department at NYU Langone Health in New York City. “We’re in the middle of the hurricane, and there’s no indication how much worse it’s going to get or when it will end.”
One long-term benefit is that the crisis may give universities and professional organizations a crash course in embracing technology.
“These types of experiences—as long as we are having them, unfortunately—are giving autism [researchers] and other researchers more skills to be able to have online conferences and online teaching as needed,” says Steven Kapp, lecturer in psychology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom.
Backup plans:
Some labs were prepared to meet the challenge, and they quickly put their emergency plans into place when news of the pandemic intensified. But, illustrating how rapidly the situation is changing, some of their plans derailed over the weekend.
The members of Gaia Novarino’s lab in Austria, for example, had divided among three offices—and could sub in for one another—and did not plan on meeting as a single group during the pandemic.
Novarino’s team has experimental mice that need to be cared for, as well as expensive 6-month-old brain organoids whose growth media must be changed every few days.
“The long-term work needs not to be stopped, because otherwise this is going to be a real disaster, and we’ll lose a year of work at least,” Novarino, professor of neuroscience at the Institute of Science and Technology in Klosterneuburg, told Spectrum on Thursday.
But on Sunday, the Austrian government forbade people from leaving their homes except for necessities or emergencies, so even her contingency plan may be put on hold.
Even without government restrictions, filling in for one another is not an option for everyone.
“In big labs you can do that, but if you have a small lab, that’s more problematic,” says Lilia Iakoucheva, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. “I currently have one person who takes care of the mice and one person who takes care of the organoids, so if that essential person is out, I’m not sure what’s going to happen.”
Stalled trials:
Researchers at other institutions have decided to hold off on clinical trials, out of concern for the health of their participants.
“If the study isn’t within typical care, it’s difficult to make the case that the benefit for the potential participant overweighs the risk,” says Egger, whose department is running a clinical trial on the use of cannabinoids in children with autism. NYU Langone has issued guidance to researchers on weighing the risks and benefits for clinical-trial participants but left the ultimate decision to researchers.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has notified researchers that it will be flexible in its policies for application and reporting deadlines for clinical trials in light of the crisis.
The situation is less dire for labs that do less wet-lab work and rely more on computational tools. Work in Jonathan Sebat’s lab at the University of California, San Diego, for example, is continuing more or less uninterrupted.
Much of the Sebat team’s genetics research is computational, so the lab has transitioned smoothly to remote work since the University of California system sent students home last week. Sequencing still requires a technician in the lab, but so far that has not been an issue, Sebat says, because it does not require groups of people to meet in person.
Remote learning:
Moving to online video platforms may change how students learn and teachers teach — which may be both beneficial and not.
“It is going to be significant in terms of how it’s going to affect the teaching and experience of undergraduate students,” says Sebat, associate professor of psychiatry and cellular and molecular medicine.
Dozens of niche organizations have canceled their spring conferences in response to the pandemic. The International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) has not yet canceled its conference, scheduled for May in Seattle, Washington, but is widely expected to either cancel or adopt a remote-only arrangement.
Sebat is the co-organizer of another autism conference, scheduled for September in China, and says he feels responsible for the health and well-being of attendees.
“Everyone who has a fall scientific conference planned is in a wait-and-see mode, but we will have to start making decisions as we approach the summer,” he says.
Even if conferences convene as planned, institutional travel bans may prohibit many attendees from making the trip, says David Beversdorf, professor of radiology, neurology and psychiatry at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.
Moving conferences to the internet may have its benefits. An informal poll Kapp posted on Twitter shows that less than 10 percent said they would not be able to attend INSAR if it were moved online, and more than 25 percent said the move would make it more possible for them to attend.
“I think for myself, as well as for people who don’t have the budget and personal finances to pay for the travel and accommodation, such as people from a different continent, that an online conference could enable many more people to participate,” Kapp says.
Moving INSAR online would require the organization to invest time in teaching presenters and participants how to use technology, a welcome development for autistic attendees who have difficulty with the sensory environment of a large conference, he says: “There could be some positive downstream effects of a greater technological literacy, as unfortunate and tragic as the situation is.”

he University of Washington department of virology sent out a note of thanks after workers and volunteers in Specimen Processing Services came together over the weekend to process COVID-19 samples. On March 14, the lab processed 2,360 samples, approximately 8 percent of which were positive, and on March 15, they tested another roughly 2,000 samples, mostly from western Washington, and found that about 6.5 percent were positive. The lab is operating at full capacity during the coronavirus pandemic and as of March 16 is only able to accept samples from established clients.
The public health department in King County, Washington, which includes Seattle, reports 488 confirmed coronavirus cases and 43 deaths as of March 16. A coronavirus vaccine clinical trial is now underway in Seattle, which National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said has been “launched in record speed.”

Bay Area Researchers Close Labs Under New Restrictions/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JXFZSY
T
oday (March 17), orders took effect in six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, plus nearby Santa Cruz County, that forbid residents to leave their homes except for work in industries deemed essential or for a handful of other approved activities, such as buying food. For researchers at institutions such as Stanford University and the University of California’s (UC) Berkeley, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz campuses, the directives, which will be in place until April 7, are bringing most lab experiments to a halt. 
Lab closed & everyone is 'sheltering in place.' I told the lab that we're not have any Zoom meetings until next week -- let's take some mental health time to adjust and re-orient.
— Hiten Madhani (@hitenmadhani) March 17, 2020
As for clinical research, the order “takes the challenges that people were having with running trials, getting patients, running a company that we started to experience at the beginning of last week—and just ratchets it up 50 notches in a matter of moments,” Greg Dombal of Halloran Consulting Group tells STAT. While pharma and biotech workers are exempt from the order, the publication notes, the COVID-19 pandemic is making trials more difficult in other ways, such as leading hospitals to restrict the hours during which study-related activities can be conducted.
At Primity Bio in San Francisco, a contract research organization that processes patient samples from clinical trials, certain aspects of operations have been postponed, pared down, or are being done remotely to maintain social distancing, Hans Layman, the company’s science director, writes in an email to The Scientist. 
“This data is important in dosing decisions for patients, to take a patient off-study, or what mitigation strategies may be necessary for that patient,” Layman says, explaining that lab workers have now been separated into morning and afternoon shifts to minimize person-to-person contact. On the whole, the lab is having to work harder to source certain reagents, but the majority of antibodies, buffers, and media used are well-stocked.
Nejat Düzgüneş, a microbiologist at Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in San Francisco, writes in an email that, now that the university is closed until at least April 7, one of his postdocs, who is Polish, is unlikely to be able to complete his experiments before his visa expires at the end of April. The postdoc has been testing the toxicity of novel photosensitizer molecules against oral cancer cells, Düzgüneş explains. “On a positive aspect of ‘shelter-in-place,’” he adds, “I can now stay at home to write my grant applications!”
Across the bay at the UC Berkeley Seismology Lab, shelter-in-place plans are still taking shape, writes operations manager Peggy Hellweg in an email to The Scientist. Her team is “figuring out details of the configuration of our new daily schedules, and, as managers, how to make sure all our people are taken care of and can do their jobs, remotely,” she says. Her lab has an advantage in that respect because most tasks “involve using computers, so that means we can ‘do them from anywhere.’” Hellweg adds that the public safety power shutoffs at UC Berkeley during last October’s wildfires were good practice for the current lockdown, as are ongoing earthquake response plans.
Much of the Bay Area has been issued a “shelter in place” policy. The Toste lab is now working from home, but not all good science is done at the bench! ????????‍????????????‍?????????? We will continue our research through writing and reading ???? We hope everyone is staying safe!
— Toste Group (@Toste_Group) March 17, 2020
Even as they encouraged faculty, staff, and trainees to comply with the orders, institutions allowed for wiggle room for animal care and other critical tasks that can only be performed in person (such exceptions are also allowed under the legal orders). In a directive dated March 15, for example, UC San Francisco administrators instructed faculty to identify a “skeleton crew” to maintain “essential animal lines, equipment, liquid nitrogen stocks, and certain long-term experiments.” At the same time, they wrote, “In mouse facilities, breeding should be reduced to the minimum possible; no increases in cage counts will be permitted and all researchers should plan for additional reductions of cage counts in the future.”
Despite such provisions, the shelter-in-place order is “a major set-back to our research program,” Ellen Robey, a professor of immunology and pathogenesis at UC Berkeley, writes in an email to The Scientist. “I am particularly concerned about 2 of my grad students who were working hard to finish their thesis research and get their manuscripts submitted and accepted.” 
The order also affects the use of animals in Robey’s lab. “A lot of our experiments use unique strains of genetically engineered mice, and our experiments are time sensitive, because we have to use the mice whenever they are available,” she says. “When we finally get back to normal with the virus, we may not have mice available for our studies. Papers, grants, graduations, and career progress will all be delayed.”
Matthew Porteus, a stem cell researcher at Stanford Medical School, writes in an email that the restrictions are “Clearly an inconvenience for research,” emphasizing that they’re “also clearly the right thing to do until we understand better how this virus is going to ripple/tear through our society.” In the meantime, he’s continuing his work through the use of “lots of Zoom meetings.”

Monkeys Develop Protective Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, SELVANEGRA
W
hether people develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after being infected once is a pressing question for policymakers, public health professionals, and everyone affected by the spreading COVID-19 pandemic. It’s of particular interest to several research groups and companies currently developing plasma therapies, whereby antibody-containing blood plasma is extracted from recovered patients and administered to patients with severe cases to help them fight off the infection.
Now, a study in monkeys provides some clues. Three rhesus macaques did not develop a second infection after recovering from a first exposure to the coronavirus and being reexposed to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that primates are capable of developing at least some short-term immunity to the pathogen. The research, posted as a preprint to bioRxiv March 14, has yet to undergo peer review. To the authors, the results indicate that reports of some COVID-19 survivors being “re-infected” a second time can be explained by issues with testing rather than a failure to develop immunity.
“This is a really critical preliminary study,” says Lisa Gralinski, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wasn’t involved in the study. Although many questions remain as to how the human immune system responds to the virus, “it’s the start of an answer that’s going to be really important to all of us.”
Based on these results, the team questions the reports of COVID-19 survivors recovering and being discharged upon testing negative for the virus, only to then develop another infection.
The team’s research began while the outbreak was mostly restricted to China. Around early February, reports surfaced that recovered COVID-19 patients who were discharged from hospitals later tested positive again, explains Chuan Qin, an experimental pathologist at the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Qin and his colleagues, some of whom have previously studied monkey responses to MERS, wanted to investigate whether it was possible to become re-infected with the new coronavirus.
The team applied a dose of SARS-CoV-2 into the windpipes of four adult rhesus macaques. The researchers detected high concentrations of the virus in the animals’ noses and throats, which peaked three days after the initial infection. This was accompanied by reduced appetite, weight loss, and an increased breathing rate. After sacrificing one of the monkeys and performing a necropsy a week after the initial exposure, the team found the animal had traces of the virus across many body tissues and had developed interstitial pneumonia—characterized by an inflammation of the lungs’ alveoli, which is one of the key symptoms of COVID-19 that can occur in people.
The team collected the blood sera of the three other animals to track whether they were developing antibodies to the virus. Using a specialized assay, they found the monkeys’ blood contained antibodies that targeted the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a surface protein the virus uses to enter human cells. Antibody levels were relatively low during the first week after infection, but surged at three and four weeks. “Our study found that neutralizing antibodies are produced in the process of recovery after SARS-CoV-2 infection,” Qin writes in an email to The Scientist.
Roughly a month days after the initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the researchers verified that the animals had cleared the infection. They couldn’t detect the virus from swabbing the nose, throat, or anus, and there were no strikingly unusual features in the lungs based on a chest X-ray.
The team then exposed two of the remaining monkeys to a second dose of the coronavirus. Although the animals developed a slight fever, neither showed weight loss. In addition, the researchers couldn’t detect the virus based on nose, throat, or anal swabs. One of the two animals was euthanized and necropsied, which confirmed that there was no viral replication across body tissues.
Support for plasma therapy for COVID-19
The researchers conclude that “neutralizing antibodies produced by SARS-CoV-2–infected monkeys can protect animals from reinfection,” Qin explains. Based on these results, the team questions the reports of COVID-19 survivors recovering and being discharged upon testing negative for the virus, only to then develop another infection. They suspect that this is probably the result of false-negative PCR tests in the hospital that missed lingering virus, and they note in the study that diagnostic techniques need to be further refined.
Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen agrees with this interpretation. “This study suggests that reinfection is likely not occurring frequently, if at all. It indicates that infection results in protective immunity against SARS-CoV, at least in the short term,” she writes in an email to The Scientist. Virologists on Twitter concur that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely, citing other recent preprints that describe a production of antibodies in people infected with SARS-CoV-2019.
It’s unclear how long this protective immunity lasts. Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester, points out that the study is very short in duration. It’s too soon to say whether the researchers’ observations are due to the immediate, initial antibody response to the virus or to a long-lasting immune memory.
Typically, viral infection triggers plasma B cells to produce antibodies, but, eventually, memory B cells, which survive for long periods of time, are also stimulated to differentiate into plasma B-cells that generate more-targeted and more-effective antibodies upon re-encountering the same pathogen. It’s not clear whether the antibody surge the team observed is part of the “stage when [initial] antibody levels are still dropping off, rather than a true memory response,” Cruickshank writes to The Scientist in an email. In addition, the study only followed the immune responses of two macaques. “These are really tiny numbers to infer anything,” she adds.
Lengthier studies that follow animals or people at least three months after infection are critical to understanding long-term immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, she explains. Research on other coronaviruses suggest different long-term immune responses. For instance, studies in SARS patients find that antibody levels fade after a few years. Some cold-causing coronaviruses “tend to induce immunity that is very short-lived, at around three months,” notes Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, in a recent statement in response to recent discussions on herd immunity in the UK. (Last week, British officials seemingly presented a plan to combat the outbreak that was communicated as allowing the deadly virus to spread to build immunity among the general population and thereby slow transmission—an approach decried by many scientists. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock later insisted to the BBC, “herd immunity is not our policy. It’s not our goal.”)
Despite the small numbers of animals observed in the study, “in these circumstances, this study is still informative and useful,” Rasmussen says. To her, the results underscore the possibility that plasma therapy approaches could be a useful treatment option. Administering antibodies from other people is thought to be one way to provide patients with immediate immunity. Some studies suggest this approach reduced the risk of death for flu patients during the 1918 influenza pandemic and improved the prognosis for certain SARS patients in the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong. Several studies testing such therapies for COVID-19 are currently underway. “Convalescent plasma in particular is a therapy that could be undertaken fairly rapidly and might be a good therapeutic intervention until we can develop an effective vaccine,” Rasmussen says.
To Gralinski, the study underscores that non-human primates could be a useful animal model to study COVID-19, because their symptoms are similar to—but not exactly the same as—those in humans. “These animals certainly aren’t progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome or anything like that, [which] you see in some people,” she says. Nevertheless, the animals may prove useful in studying whether vaccines, drugs, antivirals, and other therapies may be promising in people, she says.
“We’ve only known about this virus for ten, eleven weeks right now,” Gralinski says. “It’s great to see any type of data this quickly.”

Journals, Peer Reviewers Cope with Surge in COVID-19 Publications/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ERHUI1979
S
ince the global pandemic of COVID-19 began, scientists and clinicians have rushed to understand and mitigate the threat, while sharing with other researchers what they know. Academic journals have already taken steps to accelerate the flow of peer-reviewed information by expediting editorial and peer review for coronavirus-related manuscripts and granting them open-access status upon publication.
“This coronavirus outbreak has led to a real surge on top of what we usually receive,” says Edward Campion, the executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), who says the journal is receiving up to 40 coronarvirus-related submissions per day. He says the journal’s expert virologists “have been willing to review papers under very short turnarounds, sometimes less than 24 hours.”
I’m getting probably ten to twenty review requests a week. Before the outbreak, I was sticking to mostly four to six coronavirus papers per month.
— Stanley Perlman, University of Iowa
Coronavirus experts are intensifying their own research programs in response to the outbreak, while handling an influx of manuscripts from other researchers that require peer review.
“Before the pandemic happened, I was asked to review maybe one to two coronavirus papers per year,” says Andrew Ward, a computational biologist at the Scripps Research Institute who has researched coronaviruses for a number of years. “I am now getting three to four requests per week and have been reviewing one per week.”
“It’s pretty amazing,” says Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses. “I’m getting probably ten to twenty review requests a week. Then I’ve been reviewing five to six per week. Before the outbreak, I was sticking to mostly four to six coronavirus papers per month.”
Rozanne Sandri-Goldin, the editor in chief of the Journal of Virology, has also seen an increase in coronavirus submissions. When a limited number of established coronavirus experts are inundated with peer review requests often under tight deadlines, many first-choice reviewers are turning her editors down. “They’re not just being asked by the Journal of Virology: they’re being asked by seven or eight other journals to also review quickly.” She reports reviewers telling the journal, “‘I’m sorry but I’m already reviewing four other manuscripts, I simply can’t do this in the timeframe you’re requesting.’”
Ward notes that when the established experts such as himself can’t review a coronavirus manuscript, journals “have to go down the food chain to people with lesser experience or no experience in coronaviruses.” This increases the risk of reviewers missing errors in the study design or analysis, which could lead to the spread of inaccurate information.
A lot of these manuscripts are rejected by the editor without involving outside experts. “I have rejected probably twenty new coronavirus papers without review because they simply didn’t meet scientific Journal of Virology study criteria,” Sandri-Goldin estimates. Campion estimates the NEJM is accepting less than 2 percent of the new coronavirus submissions for publication.
Many manuscripts that make it past the editor’s desk still have issues that peer reviewers must spot and flag. “There’s no question we’ve seen a lot of rushed studies. People who are doing the minimum they can to get something published,” Perlman notes.
The coronavirus experts have a lot more papers to look at. Currently, the pre-print servers bioRxiv and medRxiv list more than 500 coronavirus papers total, many of which have not completed peer review. “It’s unclear how many of those will eventually make it to publication,” says Sandri-Goldin, who calls the number of preprints “staggering.”
Despite their increased workload, coronavirus experts emphasize the importance of swift peer review to combat misinformation and better address the pandemic, and intend to keep reviewing as many papers as they can. Most of the data in these new coronavirus papers is going to be solid, Ward notes, “but it’s hard to go through the normal academic rigor that it takes to really vet something scientifically.”

Possible Biological Explanations for Kids’ Escape from COVID-19/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ASHLEYWILEY
S
ince SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, was first recognized as a close cousin of the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, scientists have looked to the experience of that earlier epidemic to glean insight into the current global health crisis.
Kids were largely unaffected in the original SARS outbreak. In Hong Kong, no one under the age of 24 years died, while more than 50 percent of patients over 65 succumbed to the infection. Globally, less than 10 percent of those diagnosed with SARS were children, and only 5 percent of them required intensive care.
It is quite likely that children are an important source of the virus.
—Robin Shattock, Imperial College London
“There were repeated incursions from animals to humans, with both SARS and MERS, and the assumption by many was maybe children are just not exposed to the infected civet cats or camels,” says virologist Kanta Subbarao of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.
A very similar pattern has been observed with the new outbreak of COVID-19. Within Wuhan, no children tested positive between November 2019 and the second week of January, and the elderly proved particularly vulnerable. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in mid-February that out of 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 86.6 percent were between 30 and 79 years of age. The oldest among them were at greatest risk of death. And in a study of 1,099 patients in China, just 0.9 percent of confirmed cases were under the age of nine, while only 1.2 percent were between 10 and 19 years old.
Now, evidence is emerging that while few children suffer severely from COVID-19, they do get infected. A recent study even found evidence of viral excretion in children from rectal swabs. “At the moment it doesn’t seem to be causing much in the way of serious disease in young people, particularly children,” says virologist Robin Shattock of Imperial College London. However, he adds, “it is quite likely that children are an important source of the virus.”
“There is good evidence that children get infected and have a fairly high titre of virus but just don’t have serious disease,” agrees Ralph Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He saw a similar phenomenon in his mouse studies with the original SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although SARS-CoV can replicate fairly well, “younger animals are really resistant to infection in terms of the disease,” he says. When Baric tested older animals, he says, the severity of SARS illnesses rose. In one experiment, one-fifth of mice infected with SARS aged 3–4 weeks died, whereas all of the mice 7–8 weeks old died.
Subbarao has also found that young adult mice, at six weeks old, can clear SARS-CoV with no significant clinical symptoms. “When we used the same virus in 12-month-old mice, which is by no means really old, there were more clinical signs,” she says. These results indicate that both the original SARS-CoV and the one circulating now may infect children, but not make them ill. “The animal data supports the idea that they are infected but do not develop disease, because our young mice have the same levels of virus as old mice but do not get sick,” says Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa. “It is not a question of infection.”
The work on mice is now being supported by emerging epidemiological data. A preprint posted to medRxiv on March 4 analyzed 391 COVID-19 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts. The authors concluded that children are at a similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms.
An aging immune system
One explanation for the correlation between age and disease severity is that as humans’ immune systems age, more cells become inactive. “As you age, your immune system undergoes senescence and loses its capacity to respond as effectively or be regulated as effectively,” says Baric.
It could be that the type of T cell that dominates early in life is better at repelling this virus.
—Kingston Mills, Trinity College Dublin
Another explanation, which Perlman favors, is tied to the aging lung environment. In order for individuals not to easily develop asthma or overreact to environmental irritants such as pollen or pollution, aged lungs counter the usual immune reaction with some tamping down of inflammation. As a result, says Perlman, the lungs do not respond quickly enough to a viral infection. For instance, when his group makes the lungs of older mice more like those of young mice by altering prostaglandins, compounds that respond to tissue injury, “then the mice do well and they can clear the [SARS] infection and don’t get sick,” says Perlman.
In experiments reported in 2010, Perlman and his colleagues showed that T cells are especially important in clearing viruses from mice infected with SARS-CoV. “It is almost certain we need both an antibody- and T cell–response to do well” against COVID-19 infection, says Perlman. His suspicion is that the young immune system and its efficient T cells do a superior job of responding to SARS-CoV-2. A 2010 study led by Subbarao also stressed the importance of CD4+ helper T cells, which stimulate B cells to make antibodies against pathogens, in controlling SARS-CoV infection in mice.
“It could be that the type of T cell that dominates early in life is better at repelling this virus,” says immunologist Kingston Mills of Trinity College Dublin. He also proposes that young children’s higher production of a type of T cell called Th2 might guard against runaway inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. Perlman doesn’t support the proposed role of a bias toward Th2 cells in the case of this viral infection, but he does agree that an immune overreaction is problematic.
“The innate response is delayed in the elderly, so ends up playing catch-up and is exuberant,” Perlman writes in an email to The Scientist.
ACE2 receptor
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the same keyhole to enter cells, the ACE2 receptor. There’s an abundance of this receptor in cells in the lower lung, which may explain the high incidence of pneumonia and bronchitis in those with severe COVID-19 infection. A recent study showed that ACE2 is also highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, granting the virus easy access to a new host. ACE2 receptor abundance goes down in the elderly in all these tissues, but, counterintuitively, this might place them at a greater risk of severe illness.
This is because the ACE2 enzyme is an important regulator of the immune response, especially inflammation. It protects mice against acute lung injury triggered by sepsis. And a 2014 study found that the ACE2 enzyme offers protection against lethal avian influenza. Some patients with better outcomes had higher levels of the protein in their sera, and turning off the gene for ACE2 led to severe lung damage in mice infected with H5N1, while treating mice with human ACE2 dampened lung injury. 
A fall in ACE2 activity in the elderly is partly to blame for humans’ poorer ability to put the brakes on our inflammatory response as we age, according to emailed comments from Hongpeng Jia of Johns Hopkins Medicine. Reduced abundance of ACE2 receptors in older adults could leave them less able to cope with SARS-CoV-2, says Baric, though the hypothesis still needs more research.
Exposure to other coronaviruses
There are four other coronaviruses that infect humans, with symptoms typical of a common cold. These viruses are common in children. “We don’t know which of them, if any, might provide some cross immunity,” says Subbarao. It could be that immunity to viral proteins, obtained from circulating “common cold” viruses, moderates the course of COVID-19.
This is a “hand-waving hypothesis,” Subbarao adds, but one that is worth testing. Recently, it has been suggested that plasma from people who’ve recovered from COVID-19 could be transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to treat them.
“I don’t think anyone in the field knows why the disease is less robust in extremely young animals or humans,” Baric tells The Scientist. It is also still too early to know how much learned from the first SARS coronavirus applies to SARS-CoV-2. “SARS-CoV-1 will tell us a lot, but I think there is new information we are going to learn about SARS-CoV-2,” Perlman acknowledges.

Which Species Transmit COVID-19 to Humans? We’re Still Not Sure./-/ABOVE: Civet cats are thought to have passed SARS-CoV, the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, from bats to humans.

W
hen a new zoonotic outbreak occurs, scientists rush to trace the species the infection originated from. Often the infection jumps from its initial animal carrier to an intermediate host species, which then transmits the virus to humans. Identifying intermediate host species enable risk-mitigating public health policies to be implemented and gives researchers a better understanding of the disease evolution and pathogenesis.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, belongs to the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which first circulated in bats before transmitting via intermediate hosts to humans. While SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have come to humans through a similar route, “we currently don’t have any evidence that there’s an intermediate host,” says William Karesh, the executive vice president for health and policy at EcoHealth Alliance, who notes that coronaviruses can directly transmit from bats to humans without an intermediate.
The 2003 SARS outbreak began with virus transmission between bats and civet cats, which then passed it on to humans. Similarly, the intermediate host during the 2012 MERS outbreak is believed to have been dromedary camels.
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
While the COVID-19 pandemic continues, scientists are using models to look for potential intermediate hosts. As of today (March 16), there have been more than 164,000 cases reported and 6,507 deaths. The first full COVID-19 genome sequences were released in January 2020, enabling researchers to compare the human version of the coronavirus to coronavirus strains already isolated in animals.
A recent paper from the labs of Ralph Baric and Fang Li, published in the Journal of Virology, used the 2003 SARS-CoV as a template to simulate the structure of key COVID-19 proteins and predict in which other species the virus strain could bind in a manner similar to how it does in humans.
The models support the well-accepted idea that the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) controls disease transmission in SARS and COVID-19. In other words, the spike protein grabs hold of ACE2 on host cells to gain entry into cells, where it replicates, bursts open the cell, and spreads to other cells. The researchers then modeled ACE2 receptor proteins belonging to different species to see which ones are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It turns out that pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, at least some species of bats, and humans have similar levels of affinity for SARS-CoV-2 based on the structural similarity of their ACE2 receptors.
While the team did not rule out civets as intermediate hosts for the current outbreak, they noted several differences in the civet ACE2 receptor that made it less able to bind SARS-CoV-2. The going hypothesis is that the current outbreak started in bats, then moved to another species. While many of the earliest cases in Wuhan were linked to the Huanan Seafood market—which sold seafood and wildlife, including snakes and birds—not every case has a link to it. The wide variety of animal produce available at the market, and structural similarities of ACE2 receptors in many “suspect species” means scientists are still not confident about the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these models create a shortlist of potential reservoir species, “this study doesn’t identify intermediate hosts,” cautions Baric. He says he wants the findings to help researchers develop new coronavirus animal models to test vaccines and drugs and to study disease progression.
“There’s a lot of ongoing experimental work, which I think will be important for actually confirming some of the hypotheses advanced in this paper,” says Andrew Ward, a computational biologist at the Scripps Research Institute who was not involved in the study.
A similar modeling study by a different set of researchers was recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology. The authors propose—based on structural similarities between the viral RBD and host ACE2—that pangolins, snakes, and turtles could be possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The authors note that further research is needed to confirm these findings, while other experts have discredited the idea put forth by a different group of researchers in January that snakes are SARS-CoV-2 hosts.
Confirming the identity of any intermediate host through wet lab experimentation is a difficult process, and researchers may never nab the definitive culprit. “You can test thousands of bats, but to get the coronavirus you have to catch them on the day they’re shedding it,” says Karesh. He explains that it’s now several months since the initial animal-to-human SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred, and the coronavirus circulation in animals may have dropped off, which would make the original strain even harder to find.

Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Vaccine Begins in Seattle/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MARIANVEJCIK
T
he first participant in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle will be given an experimental dose today (March 16), reports the Associated Press. The trial is being funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and includes 45 young, healthy volunteers who will receive different doses of the vaccine that was co-developed by the NIH and Moderna.
Worldwide, dozens of research groups are attempting to develop coronavirus vaccines. These groups are pursuing different types of vaccines, some of which use new technologies that may make the immunization both faster to produce and more potent against the virus. Some researchers are also pursuing temporary vaccines that could offer protection for a few months as longer-lasting alternatives are developed.
See “Newer Vaccine Technologies Deployed to Develop COVID-19 Shot”
Inovio Pharmaceuticals plans to test its vaccine on volunteers at the University of Pennsylvania and at a testing center in Kansas City, Missouri, next month, reports the AP.
The participants in the trial in Seattle cannot become infected because the vaccine does not contain the virus or an attenuated version of the virus, according to The Guardian. Instead, the shot contains synthetic RNA transcripts that code for a viral protein in hopes that the recipients’ cells will translate the mRNA into protein and their immune systems will respond and develop immunity against subsequent encounters with the protein.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells the AP that even if initial safety tests go well, “you’re talking about a year to a year and a half” before a vaccine could be ready for widespread use. 
In early March, President Donald Trump met with the head of the German biotech company CureVac, which is a developing a coronavirus vaccine, and later offered a “large amount” of money in order to “secure its work,” according to a translated version of the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. The New York Times reports that two senior American officials say some German news accounts were overblown regarding the United States’s alleged efforts to acquire exclusive access to the vaccine. One official states that the Trump administration has spoken to more than 25 companies and is open to speaking with others. He says any solution to the pandemic would be shared with the world.
More than 6,500 people worldwide have now died from the coronavirus, according to Reuters, with a total of 156 countries outside of China reporting infections. Sixty people have died in the United States, where more than 3,600 individuals have become infected.

Chinese Officials Blame US Army for Coronavirus/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, EUGENEONLINE
A
Chinese official who has a history of attacking the United States online has lent a voice to a conspiracy theory that blames American soldiers for bringing COVID-19 to China, though the science does not support that narrative.
According to the unfounded accusation, which reports say has been widely shared on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to China when 300 US military members arrived in the Wuhan region for the Military World Games in mid-October and infected the local population. None of the servicemembers who made the trip have tested positive for the virus.
The rumors seemed to begin when Chinese respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan stated at a February press conference that “though the COVID-19 was first discovered in China, it does not mean that it originated from China,” planting the seeds of doubt.
On Thursday (March 12), Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, took to Twitter, a social platform banned in China, to ask, “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” 
The text of the tweet was accompanied by a video of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield saying that some deaths assumed to have been caused by the flu were actually COVID-19, though the video does not reference specific cases or dates.
Lijian has also retweeted a link to a known conspiracy site that claims the virus may have originated at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Ft. Detrick in Maryland, which was shut down in August after biosafety lapses with a number of pathogens. The website goes on to speculate that the virus went from Ft. Detrick to e-cigarettes to Hawaii to Wuhan. There is no evidence the pathogens in Maryland ever left the lab and there’s an equal lack of evidence supporting any of the other claims. 
An analysis of the virus’s genome indicates that the outbreak wasn’t caused by a strain from a lab and likely came from wild animals instead.
Despite the lack of evidence, the fact that a government official is making these claims seemingly unchecked could have larger consequences, says Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego.
“If the [Chinese] leadership really believes in the culpability of the U.S. government,” Shih tells The New York Times, “it may behave in a way that dramatically worsens the bilateral relationship.”
The statements might simply be a distraction from criticisms about how China has handled the outbreak. Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had tried to raise awareness about the virus in the early stages, was punished by the government and forced to say his concerns were an “illegal rumor.” Li contracted the virus himself while treating a patient in January and died on February 7. Critics claim that had these concerns been taken seriously at the time, it could have curbed the severity of the outbreak.
The unfounded claims could also be a response to US officials who have referred to SARS-CoV-2 as the “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” according to the Times, terms that Lijian denounced as “highly irresponsible” at a March 4 press conference.
“The conspiracy theories are a new, low front in what they clearly perceive as a global competition over the narrative of this crisis,” Julian Gewirtz, an Academy Scholar at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, tells the Times.

hile politicians and the public obsess about how and when the coronavirus pandemic will peak, the scientists able to make such projections are struggling to get a grip on what’s happening right now. “Sorry, not doing any interviews at the moment so that we can fully focus on our local and regional response,” one leading US epidemiologist wrote in an email when contacted by The Scientist.
Like any other models, the projections of how the outbreak will unfold, how many people will become infected, and how many will die, are only as reliable as the scientific information they rest on. And most modelers’ efforts so far have focused on improving these data, rather than making premature predictions.
“Most of the work that modelers have done recently or in the first part of the epidemic hasn’t really been coming up with models and predictions, which is I think how most people think of it,” says John Edmunds, who works in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Most of the work has really been around characterizing the epidemiology, trying to estimate key parameters. I don’t really class that as modeling but it tends to be the modelers that do it.”
We can slow it down by canceling all these events, which we completely should do. But it’s still going to spread to most places.

These variables include key numbers such as the disease incubation period, how quickly the virus spreads through the population, and, perhaps most contentiously, the case-fatality ratio. This sounds simple: it’s the proportion of infected people who die. But working it out is much trickier than it looks. “The non-specialists do this all the time and they always get it wrong,” Edmunds says. “If you just divide the total numbers of deaths by the total numbers of cases, you’re going to get the wrong answer.”
Earlier this month, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, dismayed disease modelers when he said COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) had killed 3.4 percent of reported cases, and that this was more severe than seasonal flu, which has a death rate of around 0.1 percent. Such a simple calculation does not account for the two to three weeks it usually takes someone who catches the virus to die, for example. And it assumes that reported cases are an accurate reflection of how many people are infected, when the true number will be much higher and the true mortality rate much lower.
Edmunds calls this kind of work “outbreak analytics” rather than true modeling, and he says the results of various specialist groups around the world are starting to converge on COVID-19’s true case-fatality ratio, which seems to be about 1 percent.
Once such numbers are pinned down, then modelers can move onto what’s called “situational awareness,” Edmunds explains. Much of that work looks backward, asking how many cases there might have been in a specific location a few weeks ago and using that information to work out how it could have spread since.
Deaths are the most useful data points for these analyses. For example, if modelers assume a case-fatality ratio of 1 percent, and that it usually takes 15 days for an infected person to die, then they know a death reported today in a specific region means that 100 people were likely infected there 15 days ago. Add in the time it takes cases to double—Edmunds says it seems to take five days—then modelers can estimate that over those 15 days the number of cases swelled to 800. So, for every death in a region, that means about 800 others are already infected, most of whom will not have been identified. This pattern was verified in Italy, Edmunds says, which as of today has reported 12,462 cases and 827 deaths. When officials tested people living near where someone had died from the disease, in many cases they found hundreds of others were already carrying the virus.
Maciej Boni, a biologist at Penn State University who has studied the spread of influenza in the tropics, says this high number of undetected cases means the spread of the virus can’t be tracked from the numbers of confirmed infections. “At this point, the spread is a moot point,” says Boni. “We can slow it down by canceling all these events, which we completely should do. But it’s still going to spread to most places.”
Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it’s almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be, Boni says, or about how many people will ultimately be affected. Modelers can try, but to do so they need much better information, such as how many people infected show natural immunity.
Most of these forward-looking “scenario planning” models currently assume everyone on the planet is susceptible, Edmunds says. Only better surveillance and data, in particular, from serum tests that would indicate whether people have been exposed to the virus whether or not they developed symptoms, will make those calculations more realistic. “At the moment, we’ve got no data to tie that model down. But as the epidemic proceeds and everytime more data comes out, like every day or every week, we refit the model and then we redo our projections.”
To build better models, some disease experts argue that the world needs to improve the way such data are handled and made available. In an editorial published this week in Science Translational Medicine, Scott Layne, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Public Health, and his colleagues propose a new data bank be created in which researchers can share results on, for example, how much virus is shed by infected people and when that starts.
“We’re all in the process of collecting that information. What this effort would do is, as that data comes in, it would point to it and help to organize it,” Layne tells The Scientist.
Backed by better information, models could help determine policies to control spread, he adds. “If those models do have any validity, then you can perturb them or pressure test them against various sorts of interventions, whether it’s making people move less or cutting down contact by a certain percentage.”
According to Reuters, Chinese officials say the restrictions on travel they put in place have pushed the epidemic to peak in China. Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, claimed at a press conference this week that if other nations follow China’s lead, then the pandemic could be tamed within months. “My advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,” he says. “If all countries could get mobilized, it could be over by June.”

SARS-CoV-2 Can Live on Plastic and Steel for 2–3 Days/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, 4X-IMAGE
T
he coronavirus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, can survive for several hours in an aerosolized form and for up to three days on plastic and steel surfaces, researchers reported Tuesday (March 10) on medRxiv. While the detection of viable virus means it’s theoretically possible to transmit the disease from contaminated surfaces or from the air—in addition to the typical route of having larger droplets land directly on a new host after an infected person, say, coughs in their proximity—“We’re not by any way saying there is aerosolized transmission of the virus,” coauthor Neeltje van Doremalen of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases tells the Associated Press.
The authors applied SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, to plastic, stainless steel, copper, and cardboard in the lab and created aerosolized viruses using a nebulizer. 
They found viable SARS-CoV-2 three hours after the virus was aerosolized and suspended in the air within a drum, and on surfaces four hours, 24 hours, and 2–3 days after it was deposited to copper, cardboard, and steel or plastic, respectively. SARS-CoV lasted about as long, although it lost viability sooner on cardboard and more slowly on copper. The median half-life for SARS-CoV-2 was 13 hours on steel and 16 hours on plastic.
See “How COVID-19 Is Spread”
“It’s a solid piece of work that answers questions people have been asking,” Julie Fischer, a microbiologist at Georgetown University who was not involved in the study, tells the AP. “What we need to be doing is washing our hands, being aware that people who are infected may be contaminating surfaces,” and not touching our faces.
As of today, more than 125,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 4,617 deaths, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
David Weber, an epidemiologist and infectious disease expert at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with the new research, called the study “excellent” in an interview with Buzzfeed, but notes that it can’t explain how risky contaminated surfaces are. “Does that account for 0.01% of transmissions or 15% of transmissions?” Weber says. “We don't know how frequent it is.” He also cautions that the lab conditions might not precisely recapitulate what happens in the real world.

RNA Extraction Kits for COVID-19 Tests Are in Short Supply in US/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, ANYAIVANOVA
A
n RNA extraction kit that is in high demand for COVID-19 testing is on backorder, Germany-based diagnostics and biological supplies company Qiagen tells Politico. At manufacturing sites in Hilden, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain, workers are now staffing three shifts, seven days a week, a Qiagen spokesperson tells STAT, and the company is attempting to make the kits at its Germantown, Maryland, site as well.
The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of another RNA extraction kit made by Roche, Denny Russell, who is leading the coronavirus response for the Washington State Public Health Laboratory, tells Politico. But labs must be equipped to use the Roche method, which requires different equipment than the Qiagen kit does. Michael Mina, a pathologist and assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, tells STAT that Roche’s test is also on backorder. “[It’s] a very big problem.” He adds to Politico, “RNA extraction is the first step in being able to perform [a coronavirus test]. If we cannot perform this step, the [coronavirus] test cannot be performed.”
So far, approximately 5,000 people in the US have been tested for coronavirus (yielding 647 confirmed COVID-19 cases), and that number is expected to grow rapidly. Until recently, public health labs have been running at least two separate tests for each patient, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released updated guidelines on Monday (March 9) that allow labs to combine samples from the nose and throat into one test, halving the number of extraction kits needed. CDC Director Robert Redfield tells Politico that he doesn’t know what his agency would do if RNA extraction kits and reagents become unavailable.
In addition to dwindling reagents for the RNA extraction kits, there is also a shortage of the chemicals needed for SARS-CoV-2 PCR test kits. “We are deeply concerned that as the number of tests increases dramatically over the coming weeks, clinical labs will be unable to deploy them without these critical components,” the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) says about the PCR reagents in a statement. “Increased demand for testing has the potential to exhaust supplies needed to perform the testing itself.”
ASM applauds the CDC’s guidance to use only one test per person, and further commends the agency’s expanded testing criteria released earlier this week “to guide clinicians in deciding who should be tested based on risk, exposure and symptoms.”

College Class Cancellations Skyrocket Amid Coronavirus Concerns/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, URBANGLIMPSES
As changes are happening rapidly, please check with institutions’ websites for the latest policies.
A
s the number of coronavirus cases in the United States continues to climb, many universities are taking steps to protect their students and faculty by minimizing on-campus activity in favor of online-only classes and exams, even if there have not been any cases of COVID-19 on campus. The threat of the virus is exacerbated by the fact that most schools have spring break in the coming weeks and hordes of students will be traveling, many internationally.
Many institutions in countries such as Italy, China, and South Korea, which have been hit hard by the virus, have already moved students into online learning, and numerous life science conferences have either moved online, postponed, or canceled their events in light of the outbreak. The University of Washington was the first US university to call off in-person instruction, due to its proximity to the outbreak in Seattle. A rabbi who teaches at Yeshiva University in New York has tested positive for the virus and underwent a self-imposed quarantine. The school has canceled undergraduate classes this week.
Even with in-person classes moving online, most dining facilities, residence halls, and libraries are remaining open to provide necessary services for students who might not have any other place to go. Still, according to Forbes, there is a strain on students who rely on work-study programs to make ends meet.

Studies Estimate Incubation Time, Infectious Period of SARS-CoV-2/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, KIEFERPIX
P
atients have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 genetic material after apparently recovering from infection with the virus and being discharged from the hospital, according to media reports and a study published in JAMA last month. The phenomenon has sparked concerns that people could continue to infect others long after their illness had passed. But a preprint posted to medRxiv yesterday (March 9) suggests that patients with mild symptoms shed viable viral particles for 10 days or less after the onset of illness.  
“This is a very important contribution to understanding both the natural history of Covid-19 clinical disease as well as the public health implications of viral shedding,” says Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, in remarks to STAT. Osterholm was not involved in the study. 
The work was conducted on nine patients in Germany. The authors found a high load of infectious viral particles in samples from the patients’ throats and lungs early in the illness, peaking four days after symptoms started. But while viral RNA could still be observed in the samples once symptoms had cleared, there were no detectable infectious particles after day eight from the onset of symptoms in those patients who’d had mild symptoms. No infectious particles were detected in stool, blood, or urine.
“Based on the present findings, early discharge with ensuing home isolation could be chosen for patients who are beyond day 10 of symptoms with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies per ml of sputum,” the authors write in their report. The results have not undergone peer review.
In another study, published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers analyzed news reports and press releases mentioning exposure and symptom onset dates for patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Among the 181 cases the authors found, the median time between exposure and symptom onset was 5.1 days, and 97.5 percent of people who became ill did so within 11.5 days of exposure.
“Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long term,” says study coauthor Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a news release.
“It’s very reassuring that by 14 days, while it might not be 100%, it will be close,” Graham Cooke, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, tells The Guardian. Cooke cautions that people who’ve been exposed shouldn’t assume they’re in the clear if they haven’t developed symptoms after five days. “That’s absolutely the wrong interpretation,” he says. “At five days, half of people won’t yet have developed symptoms.”

Clarification (March 10): The wording of this article’s subheading has been adjusted to make it clear that five days after infection was the median time it took for people to get sick in the study.
Scientists Use Online Game to Research COVID-19 Treatment/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, NAEBLYS
R
esearchers are calling on citizen scientists to play a free online game called Foldit, in which they help design and identify proteins that may be able to bind to and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that it uses to invade host cells. The scientists hope that players’ creations will yield insights that will allow them to create an effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19. Other researchers are asking citizens for help in a more passive way. The Scientist spoke with Brian Koepnick, who works on Foldit at the University of Washington Institute for Protein Design, about this project.
The Scientist: What is Foldit? How does it work?
Brian Koepnick: Foldit is a free, online game that anyone in the world can download and run on their Mac, Linux, or Windows PC. The main drive of Foldit is our science puzzles. These are weekly challenges that we refresh every week . . . that are directly related to research we’re doing here in the lab at the Institute for Protein Design or in our other labs. Foldit players can participate in the science puzzles. . .  [which] are constructed in such a way that competing players who develop high-scoring solutions make meaningful research contributions.
An example from the latest game on Foldit, which asks users to design proteins to bind to the coronavirus spike protein
FOLDIT
TS: What kinds of meaningful contributions can players make?
BK: Citizen scientists can design proteins that fold up, and they can design it from scratch. There are number of these problems where we would like to create a new molecule, a new protein that’s never existed before, that could perform some kind of function. The highest-profile one right now being the coronavirus antiviral design that we’re doing at Foldit. So for this coronavirus puzzle, we’d like to design a new protein that could bind to the coronavirus-like [spike] protein and prevent recognition and infection of human cells like coronavirus.
TS: Scientists already have some drugs in clinical trials for coronavirus. Is it too late for Foldit to be helpful for this outbreak?
Brian Koepnick
IAN HAYDON
BK: This is definitely long-term. The Foldit puzzles are the first step in drug discovery. So anything discovered by Foldit players in these puzzles still has to undergo more rigorous testing in animals and humans. And of course, that takes time. There are things in trials right now for coronavirus, and with any luck . . . those will become available very soon. But until there is something on the market, I think we will continue to pursue all available options for coronavirus therapeutics.
TS: So if something else makes it to market first, you’ll stop using Foldit to research proteins that can bind to SARS-COV2?
BK: There are still things we can gain from pursuing a project like this. In particular, we would like to be prepared for the next pandemic. If we can iron out all the kinks in this approach early-on then we can be more prepared the next time. 
This field of protein design is still very much a new field, especially the citizen science aspect of it—crowdsourcing it to nonexperts. So just the experience that we get from working on a problem like this is great. The other huge benefit of Foldit and puzzles like this is simply engagement with the public. This is a way for the public to learn more about coronavirus and the biology behind it—why vaccine design or therapeutic design is difficult. And for them to help . . . for them to actually contribute. Even if there were a complete “cure-all” that came out on the market tomorrow for a dollar a pop, I think we would still keep challenging all the players to work against coronavirus.

Global COVID-19 Cases Top 100,000/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, GREGOBAGEL
O
n Thursday (March 5), confirmed global cases of COVID-19 have topped 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The milestone coincided with a number of developments in the response to the outbreak, including an emergency spending bill and the closure of a major university in the US and new, preliminary findings on the pathology of the virus. 
“This is not a drill,” Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated at a briefing on Thursday. “This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops.”
“This epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government,” Tedros continued. “We are calling on every country to act with speed, scale and clear-minded determination.”
See “Follow The Coronavirus”
Emergency Spending Bill 
Today (March 6), President Donald Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to address the coronavirus outbreak. The Trump Administration had initially requested just $2 billion, paid in part by siphoning money from Ebola research, but Congress passed a bill that does not require reallocating those resources.
Of the spending package, $3 billion will go toward research aimed at developing vaccines, treatments, and therapies, and $2.2 billion is earmarked to aid containment and testing efforts at the local, state, and federal levels. The State Department will receive $1.25 billion for use with overseas evacuations and containment, and for humanitarian purposes.
Universities Cancel Classes
Also this morning, the University of Washington became the first US college to announce that all in-person classes are being converted to online classes, as the Seattle area has been hit particularly hard by the outbreak. Universities in some other countries, including Italy, China, and South Korea, have already made the transition.
“Our goal is to complete this academic quarter with as little disruption to our students and their educational progress as possible,” university president Ana Mari Cauce tells the Times. The change will be effective Monday, March 9, and continue through March 20, which marks the end of the winter quarter. 
According to the Times, there are widespread concerns at US colleges about the bulk of the student body traveling during the upcoming spring break, potentially coming into contact with the virus, and bringing it back to campuses once classes resume.
Two SARS-CoV-2 Strains?
A team of researchers in China published a paper earlier this week suggesting that the global outbreak might be caused by two distinct strains of SARS-CoV-2. Their manuscript, which has not undergone peer review, reports that a genomic analysis of over 100 samples of SARS-CoV-2 reveals two distinct strains of the virus, with one more virulent than the other. 
Though there are fewer instances of the strain the researchers dub S type, which they say is associated with milder symptoms, they suggest it is the ancestral strain. The L type is newer, they write, but is far more aggressive and was much more prevalent than the S type in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak.
Experts who spoke with the Los Angeles Times about the paper expressed some skepticism about its conclusions, however, and a published critique claims the research team “should retract their paper, as the claims made in it are clearly unfounded and risk spreading dangerous misinformation at a crucial time in the outbreak.”
Children Can Catch SARS-CoV-2
Younger demographics have been far less likely to become sick during the outbreak, so it hasn’t been clear whether they were contracting the virus as often as the older people around them. A preprint published Wednesday on medRxiv suggests that children are just as likely to harbor the virus as adults. 
“Kids are just as likely to get infected and they’re not getting sick,” Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, tells The New York Times. The lack of symptoms might explain why there haven’t been large outbreaks spreading through schools. Still, children could be passing the virus along to others who are at a higher risk of becoming severely ill, he says.

W
hen Emma Hodcroft read that, seemingly out of nowhere, a rash of cases of the novel coronavirus had popped up in Britain in late January, she started collecting media reports on them, searching the articles for clues as to how it had moved to the island nation. Early reports suggested that a lone traveler from Singapore, who was unaware he was infected with virus, had visited a French chalet for a few days and had spread the virus to others at the ski resort. This intrigued Hodcroft, who is half British and a postdoctoral researcher in evolutionary biologist Richard Neher’s lab at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where she uses genetics to study and track diseases. She took notes on the cases that were associated with the infected traveler. “At first, there wasn’t that much information and the story was simple,” she tells The Scientist. But more and more cases kept appearing, and she found it hard to keep track of who had traveled to which country and when they were diagnosed.
Hodcroft decided to generate an infographic showing the connections between the traveler from Singapore and the other coronavirus cases emerging in Europe. “I thought, I’ll make an image and see if anyone else finds this useful,” she says. She posted the image on Twitter, and “somewhat unexpectedly, it got a lot of attention,” she says. “People were definitely really, really interested in this. So I kept that image updated over the next week or so.” As she updated it, the graphic showed that at least 21 people were exposed to the virus at the ski resort the traveler from Singapore visited; 13 of those people ended up developing COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. After she’d finished the preliminary work, a colleague of Hodcroft saw it and suggested she write it up for publication. She posted the paper on February 26; the next day it appeared in Swiss Medical Weekly.
Hodcroft talked with The Scientist about the work, how its conclusions have been supported by genetic testing of viral strains from patients, and what it tells us about the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in other countries.
The Scientist: What are the main takeaways from your paper?
Emma Hodcroft: Firstly, that it seems like so many people [at least 13] could be infected by a single person. It seems like they were infected by the man who traveled from Singapore. So that’s quite a lot of forward transmission on his part in a fairly short time period; he was only in France for about four days. Of course, this could be some unusual event that doesn’t normally happen, but it lets us put an outer bound on what is possible even if it is not common.  
The other thing that’s surprising is that, according to the patient statement that he released, the focal patient never had any symptoms. In his own words, he never felt sick. So he did all of this transmission without ever having any indication that he was unwell or that he should be taking any precautions to modify his behavior. It tells us that some infections might be from people who never even know that they’re sick.

TS: Were the cases in this cluster severe or mild?
EH: As far as we can tell, no one from this cluster had severe symptoms. It seems like some people did have some symptoms, but they were never serious. And that’s also interesting because it shows that if we didn't know about this outbreak, it’s pretty likely that these people would have kind of written this off as a bad cold or the flu. None of them would have ended up going to hospital or significantly changing their behavior. And again, this indicates that it might be quite hard, and it is becoming quite hard, to contain this virus because some people don't feel very unwell, such that they would change their behavior or go for testing.
TS: The number of cases has been skyrocketing in several countries, the US included. How does your work on this cluster connect with genetic data being reported on NextStrain.org about this spike in cases?
EH: In the US, from the information available, it still doesn’t seem like the US has really ramped up testing. We don’t know the number of tests that have been performed because it’s come down off of the CDC website, which is a little concerning. But at least the last reports that were given to us show the US was really lagging behind most countries in the number of tests that it had done. 
See “Coronavirus’s Genetics Reveal Its Global Travels”
A few days ago, the research group called the Seattle Flu Study, which is designed to take community samples from random people who have any kind of cough, runny nose, or cold-like symptoms and look for the flu—they pivoted and started testing some of the samples for coronavirus. They found a case in the Seattle area and sequenced the viral genome of the infected person [posted on NextStrain] and showed it links very closely with another case in the Seattle area that’s from mid-January. And so this strongly suggests (though we don’t yet know for certain) that there has been ongoing undetected transmission in Seattle since mid-January and wasn’t picked up because we weren’t looking for it. This has become clearer in the last few days, as more cases and even deaths have been reported in Washington State. That tells us the virus hasn’t just appeared in the last few days in the area.
Text continues below graphic
The viral genome of the first case in Washington (USA/WA1/2020) is identical to Fujian/8/2020. The genome of the virus from a second case in Washington (USA/WA2/2020) is identical to the first Washington case, except it has three additional mutations. This suggests WA1 was a traveler from China bringing the virus to Snohomish County, Washington in mid-January, where the virus circulated undetected for about five weeks, a timespan that explains why WA2 is so similar genetically, with a few mutations. The graphic shows the connection to the other cases with viral sequences now available.
NEXTSTRAIN.ORG
TS: How do the deaths indicate that the virus has been there for weeks?
EH: This virus causes respiratory illness, which can make you feel unwell for a few days and then you get better or it can progress. If the illness progresses it can cause lung damage that makes the person more susceptible to other illnesses, such as bacterial infection. This can be treated too and for many people that treatment turns the course of the infection, but some don’t and the effort can essentially delay their death. So the infection may have occurred weeks [before a person dies]. This is not something intrinsic to this virus, however. With respiratory illness, it’s usually something that takes a substantial amount of infection and lung damage before you succumb to it. 
TS: Why is genetic tracing to link cases important?
EH: Sequencing can tell us a lot about what is happening with the virus right now. The Washington samples are a perfect example. . . . Without having these genomes, we never would have seen this signal of ongoing transmission, which we saw just before the case explosion in Washington. And on the flip side we can tell when cases are coming in from other countries. We have another genome from Washington State that’s grouping with genomes that we know have a travel history to Italy—so it seems like this could be a case where [an infected person] came back from Italy. 
When you have a very small number of cases of a disease, you can do this just through epidemiological contact tracing: you can go to everyone and ask questions and find out the connections between the cases. As the case numbers scale up, this becomes very hard to do. With genetic sequencing, we can do this without having to go and try and figure out where everyone was at the time of infection. We’ve had an influx of sequences from Brazil, Switzerland, Mexico, Scotland, Germany. These have clustered with sequences from Italy and have a travel history from Italy and so from that we can show that Italy really is now exporting cases around the world to multiple countries. 
TS: How might public health officials use this information? Is it applicable to making decisions about containment or air travel?
EH: There’s been a lot of modeling, not only with genetics but epidemiologically in the last few weeks, and we had pretty strong indications that circulation was wider than publicly thought. At the time, we did try to some extent to get this message out to government health agencies and the public in general. I do think that in the future, incorporating a little bit more of that scientific expertise perhaps into the public dialogue and government decision-making could make a big difference. The earlier that you can act in an epidemic, you have more effect you can have, because one person goes on to infect a few more people who go on to infect a few more people. It’s much harder once that has gone up to 10 [infected] people, than if you can stop with person one.
One thing I would note is that studies have shown that limiting transportation really doesn’t make much of an impact for outbreaks. Quarantining particular cities, if they seem to be epicenters, can work as a preventive measure, but as the epidemic scales up, you move past being able to contain it in this sense, [and] what you end up doing is just disrupting supply routes, interrupting business, making all of these things much harder.

Theory that Coronavirus Escaped from a Lab Lacks Evidence/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, MOISEXVII
S
ince the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic, theories have circulated about the origin of the novel coronavirus causing the disease, SARS-CoV-2. One prominent rumor is that it first escaped from a lab in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses and then spread to the public. This theory has also evolved into claims that the virus was genetically engineered to be a bioweapon. But scientists say that while there’s not enough information to pinpoint where the virus came from, there is no evidence that it was created in a lab.
The lab-escape theory had been circulating on social media and various blogs for weeks, but gained considerable visibility in a New York Post article in late February. In it, Steven Mosher, a social scientist and the president of the Population Research Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, summarizes why he believes SARS-CoV-2 may have been accidentally spread by China’s National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers have studied bat coronaviruses.
In the article, Mosher describes several lines of reasoning, namely, that the lab is less than 10 miles away from the seafood market where a cluster of COVID-19 cases was first discovered, and that after the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV virus escaped from virology labs multiple times in China. He also describes how Chinese virologist and bioweapons expert Major General Chen Wei went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology with military scientists in January to study the new virus, which Mosher sees as a form of damage control.
“The circumstantial evidence surrounding it is pretty compelling. . . . The idea that the epicenter of this epidemic would be just a few miles from the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, which is where we know that dangerous pathogens are being kept and looked at as potential bioweapons, I think the odds against that are just astronomical,” Mosher tells The Scientist.
We don’t need to come up with farfetched theories when the genome sequences and the characteristics of these viruses support what we’re seeing.
—Paul McCray, University of Iowa
Dimitrios Paraskevis, an epidemiologist at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece, tells The Scientist that while it’s not possible to rule out the idea of lab escape, he believes that it is unlikely. “Any person who works in a lab must follow very strict safety regulations. It sounds to me very extraordinary that something happened and nobody took care about such an accident,” he says. The World Health Organization updated SARS surveillance guidelines in 2004 after the lab-based outbreaks, urging labs to follow proper biosafety procedures, and China replaced the director of its Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
One problem leading to a lot of apprehension and speculation about the new coronavirus is that scientists “don’t know what the actual source of the virus was,” Anthony Fehr, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Kansas, tells The Scientist. Additionally, researchers don’t know if SARS-CoV-2 immediately started to spread in humans after a single transmission from an animal, or if it took multiple zoonotic events between an infected animal population and humans.
Despite the question mark around the exact source of the disease, it does appear to have originally come from wildlife, according to a team of international public health scientists who wrote a statement published in The Lancet. An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology suggests that the virus’s genome is 96 percent similar to a coronavirus found in bats.
Mosher agrees that animals were the likely origin. “That doesn’t mean [the virus] wasn’t collected, brought to the lab, and was being tested on in various ways, and escaped from the lab,” he says. Mosher also does not claim that China genetically engineered the virus. “I’m not saying this has been genetically engineered to be a bioweapon that’s escaped from the lab. . . . I’m just saying that [China is] collecting dangerous pathogens, [and] they have a history of letting them escape from the lab,” he says.
Transmission from an animal, with no lab experiment or genetic manipulation involved, fits best with what scientists know about how other coronaviruses have made the jump to humans. In the past, these viruses have spread through wild bats that infect another type of animal—an intermediate host—that then spreads it to humans. SARS-CoV, for example, was transmitted from bats to civets to humans, while camels were an intermediate host in MERS, according to Quanta. The civet version of SARS-CoV was 99.8 percent similar to the one found in humans—much more closely related than the bat and human varieties of SARS-CoV-2—so researchers believe the new coronavirus also infected another type of animal on its way from bats to humans. But they have not found a candidate so far, according to Nature.
This ability to move in between different animal hosts is a characteristic feature of coronaviruses, according to Paul McCray, a pulmonologist at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine whose lab studies coronaviruses. “It’s exactly what we’ve learned in studies of SARS in 2002 and 2003, and MERS in 2012. . . . So the concept that this is happening again should come as no surprise,” he says. “For people that work with these viruses, this is completely unsurprising. We don’t need to come up with farfetched theories when the genome sequences and the characteristics of these viruses support what we’re seeing.”
No signs of engineering in SARS-CoV-2 genome
In addition to the claim that a naturally evolved virus escaped from a lab by mistake, some conspiracy theories have posited that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered. In fact, researchers throughout the world, including in the US and China, have conducted research involving the creation of experimentally engineered hybrid coronaviruses. But there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered, says Paraskevis, whose genomic analysis of the new virus was reported as a preprint in January.
I’m not saying this has been genetically engineered to be a bioweapon that’s escaped from the lab. . . . I’m just saying that [China is] collecting dangerous pathogens, [and] they have a history of letting them escape from the lab.
—Steven Mosher, Population Research Institute
RNA viruses, which include coronaviruses, “accumulate mutations at a rate one million times faster than human DNA [does]. . . . It gives them the ability to survive against an immune response,” Paraskevis says. While the new coronavirus does have some genetic differences to other known viruses due to mutations, “there’s no evidence that this is the result of a human experiment,” he says, adding that if the virus were engineered, scientists would expect to see additional genetic material in its genome. For example, an early bioRxiv preprint on SARS-CoV-2 found HIV-like genetic sequences, but online commenters pointed out that “the findings were at most a coincidence” and that research has since been retracted, reports STAT.
As there are still many unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, researchers worldwide are trying to uncover as much as they can about the virus. Chinese researchers “released the genomic sequence incredibly rapidly online. . . . They were very public in sharing the most important first piece of information” about it, McCray tells The Scientist. “The fact that scientists all over the world had access to that genomic sequence” made a lot of early research possible, he says.

Italy Closes All Schools for Two Weeks as Coronavirus Spreads/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LINCOLN BEDDOE
Update (March 5): The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has activated a mandatory remote work policy for its Seattle-based employees, effective through at least March 31.
I
taly’s education minister, Lucia Azzolina, announced today (March 4) that her government has ordered a nationwide closure of schools until March 15 due to the spread of coronavirus, according to Bloomberg. Schools and universities in northern Italy, where the outbreak was centered, had already shut down roughly 10 days ago. Currently, according to The Guardian, more than 2,500 people in Italy have been infected. 
The BBC reports that a school closure in Japan will last through the end of the academic year in late March. Classes are also suspended in China, and the nation’s roughly 180 million students are now using an online learning platform in order to continue their studies, reports the South China Morning Post.
These developments have prompted universities in the West to reevaluate study abroad programs and consider moving classes online, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. Philip Altbach, the founding director of Boston University’s Center for International Higher Education, tells Times Higher Ed that there is “no question that international student enrollments will take a hit, and probably a reasonably significant one, in the coming year.”
There are also growing concerns about how to protect university communities in the wake of the virus. A staff member from Rice University who had traveled internationally has possibly been exposed to the coronavirus, causing 17 people to be quarantined, reports the Chronicle. On the East Coast, an employee of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center tested positive, and in Washington state, students from the Lake Washington Institute of Technology may have been exposed when they visited a nursing home where several patients have since died from the virus.
See “Coronavirus Precautions Stifle Research” 
There are now 85 reported cases of the coronavirus in the UK, a number that increased by 34 in a single day, reports The Guardian, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo confirms that there are six cases of coronavirus in his state, where a Westchester patient infected his wife, son, daughter, and neighbor.
According to CBS News, nine people infected with the coronavirus have now died in the US, with all deaths occurring in Washington state.

How SARS-CoV-2 Tests Work and What’s Next in COVID-19 Diagnostics/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DEFUN
T
he quick sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and distribution of the data early on in the COVID-19 outbreak has enabled the development of a variety of assays to diagnose patients based on snippets of the virus’s genetic code. But as the number of potential cases increases, and concerns rise about the possibility of a global pandemic, the pressure is on to enable even faster, more-accessible testing.
Current testing methods are considered accurate, but governments have restricted testing to central health agencies or a few accredited laboratories, limiting the ability to rapidly diagnose new cases, says epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina, the director of the pathology laboratory and molecular diagnostics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. These circumstances are driving a commercial race to develop new COVID-19 tests that can be deployed within hospitals and clinics to provide diagnostic answers in short order.
Globally, nearly 89,000 cases have now been reported—more than 80,000 of these in China—along with more than 3,000 deaths. The virus has been found in 64 countries, six of those in just the past day.
How the current SARS-CoV-2 assays work
The full genome of the novel coronavirus was published on January 10 of this year, just weeks after the disease was first identified in Wuhan, China. A week later, a group of researchers led by German scientists released the first diagnostic protocol for COVID-19 using swabbed samples from a patient’s nose and throat; this PCR-based protocol has since been selected by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Not all countries have adopted the WHO’s recommended diagnostic, including the US.
The assay was initially developed from genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and its close relative SARS, and later refined using the SARS-CoV-2 genome data to target viral genes unique to the newly discovered virus. In particular, the test detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2’s E gene, which codes for the envelope that surrounds the viral shell, and the gene for the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Yvonne Doyle, the medical director and the director of health protection for Public Health England, tells The Scientist in an email that once a sample is received by a laboratory, it takes 24–48 hours to get a result. Commenting on the test’s accuracy, she says all the positive results to date in the United Kingdom, a total of 36 so far, have been confirmed with whole genome sequencing of the virus isolated from patient samples, and “the analytical sensitivity of the tests in use is very high.”
This approach also underpins COVID-19 laboratory testing in Australia, where 27 cases have so far been diagnosed, says medical virologist Dominic Dwyer, the director of public health pathology for NSW Health Pathology at Westmead Hospital in Sydney. “We decided in the end to have a screening approach using the WHO primers that target the so-called E gene of the coronavirus,” he says. “If a screening test is positive, we then do some confirmatory testing which selects other targets of the virus genome.”
The laboratory at Westmead Hospital also does a complete sequencing of every virus sample to look for possible new strains of SARS-CoV-2 and has shared some of those sequences in the international Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database for other researchers to study. The staff also cultures the virus and images it using electron microscopy. “That’s not really a diagnostic test, but gives you some confirmation of what you’re seeing in the laboratory,” Dwyer says.
He adds that, so far, there’s no suggestion of false positive findings, because every positive test has been confirmed with whole genome sequencing, viral culture, or electron microscopy. As for false negatives, he adds, it would be hard to know if any infected patients were mistakenly given the all-clear.
Not all countries have adopted the WHO’s recommended diagnostic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, has developed its own assay that looks for three sequences in the N gene, which codes for the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein found in the virus’s shell, also known as the capsid. The assay also contains primers for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. Dwyer says that the principles of testing are the same; it’s just the genetic targets that vary.
Mina says it’s not clear why the CDC chose to develop a different assay to that selected by the WHO and taken up by other countries. “Was this actually based on superior knowledge that the CDC had, or was this more of an effort to just go our own route and have our own thing and feel good about developing our own test in the US versus the rest of the world?” says Mina, who is also assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. The CDC declined to respond to questions from The Scientist.
Who does the testing
In the UK, testing for COVID-19 is being done by a range of accredited laboratories across the country. In the US, all laboratory testing for COVID-19 has until recently been done exclusively by the CDC. The turnaround time for a result has been 24–72 hours. Mina argues that enabling hospitals to conduct their own on-site diagnostics could speed up the process. For instance, hospitals can generate flu results within an hour, Mina says, most commonly using assays that detect viral antigens. “We spend a lot of money getting rapid turnaround tests in the hospital for flu, for example, because we have to know how to triage people.”
The day or two or three that it takes to get COVID-19 results has had logistical ramifications for hospitals, Mina says. “If we have a patient who we only suspect is positive, even if they are not positive, just the suspicion alone will lead us to have to find an isolation bed for them,” he says.
There has been a move by the CDC to send out RT-PCR test kits to state health laboratories, says Molly Fleece, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Hopefully, more laboratories around the country will be able to have access to these testing kits and be able to test specimens instead of having to send all the specimens to the CDC for testing,” she says.
However, that plan hit a snag recently when one of the CDC kits’ reagents was found to be faulty. The agency has announced that the reagent is now being remanufactured.
SARS-CoV-2 tests in development
There are now numerous companies working on commercial test kits in response to the rising diagnostic demands of the epidemic. Most are applying the same real-time PCR methods already in use, but others are taking a different approach. For instance, Mina and colleagues are trialling a diagnostic in partnership with Sherlock Biosciences, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The researchers are using CRISPR technology to tag the target SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a fluorescent probe.
We’re not at that stage yet of rolling out the serology or antibody tests.

“In many ways it’s similar to real-time PCR but it’s just more sensitive and much more rapid,” Mina says. Another CRISPR-based diagnostic protocol developed by researchers at the McGovern Institute at MIT uses paper strips to detect the presence of a target virus, and claims to take around one hour to deliver the result. It has not yet been tested on COVID-19 patient samples, and the institute has stressed the test still needs to be developed and validated for clinical use, for COVID-19 or any other viral disease. Meanwhile, Anglo-French biotech company Novacyte has announced the release of its real-time PCR diagnostic kit for COVID-19, which it says will deliver results in two hours.
A different diagnostics approach would be to devise blood tests for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a development that Mina says will be an important next step for monitoring the spread of the virus. “Could we just start taking blood samples from people around the world and see how many people who had no symptoms or very minimal symptoms may have actually been exposed to this?” Mina asks.
Dwyer says such approaches could help detect any false negatives that slip through the PCR-based protocols, but “we’re not at that stage yet of rolling out the serology or antibody tests.” Numerous groups are trying to isolate antibodies, some with more success than others. Researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore have used antibody testing to demonstrate a link between two separate clusters of infections, and in patients who had cleared their symptoms at the time they were given the antibody test. Meanwhile, researchers in Taiwan are also working to identify a SARS-CoV-2 antibody that could be used for diagnostic testing, and they say such a test could deliver a result in a matter of minutes rather than hours.

Second US Coronavirus Death Confirmed in Washington State/-/rAVOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WILDPIXEL
W
ashington State health officials confirmed that six people have died from the coronavirus, following a March 1 announcement that a man in his 70s was the second person to have died from COVID-19 in the US, according to the Associated Press. The first was a man in his 50s who also lived in Washington, which now has 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Dozens of residents and staff members of the LifeCare nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, are sick and being tested for the virus after three elderly people there were diagnosed, reports The Washington Post. KOMO News reports that two of the LifeCare residents have died of coronavirus. According to the AP, more than two dozen members of the International Association of Firefighters who responded to calls from the LifeCare facility are now being quarantined.
In California, two health care workers in San Francisco’s North Bay who had been exposed to the first US patient who contracted the virus without a connection to international travel were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Sunday, according to the AP, and Alameda County there declared a state of emergency in response.
In San Antonio, a woman who had been brought to the US from Wuhan, China, tested “weakly positive” for the virus after being released from quarantine on Saturday following two negative test results, according to a separate report in the Associated Press. 
Elsewhere in the US, two people have tested positive in Oregon, while authorities on Sunday announced Illinois’s third case, Rhode Island’s second case, and New York’s first case, according to the AP. Reuters reports that Florida confirmed its first two cases late on Sunday and also declared a public health emergency.
The World Health Organization reports that more than 3,000 people have now died from the coronavirus and nearly 90,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
“Cryptic transmission”
Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, announced that genetic sequencing of two SARS-CoV-2 virus samples had revealed strong similarities between the virus of the first person diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US, back in mid-January, and a recently diagnosed patient, both from the same county in Washington state, according to The Washington Post.
“This strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in Washington State for the past 6 weeks,” Bedford writes in a thread on Twitter. “I believe we’re facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State  that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China.”
“I think he’s right,” molecular evolution researcher Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh tells The New York Times. “It’s extremely unlikely that two viruses coming from outside the U.S.A. independently would arrive in the same geographical area and be genetically related unless they were connected.”
Vice President Mike Pence told CNN on Sunday that the federal government released more than 15,000 test kits to state and local health clinics, and that there are plans to release 50,000 more, according to the AP. Reuters reports that Pence says the government had contracted 3M to produce 35 million extra respiratory masks.
A vaccine could enter clinical trials in six weeks, Pence told Fox News.
A separate AP article reports that the White House and the National Academy of Sciences have established a new panel of scientific experts to build on the administration’s efforts to fight the coronavirus and contain the surrounding misinformation and panic. 
According to Reuters, Pence told NBC on March 1, “Other than in areas where there are individuals that have been infected with the coronavirus, people need to understand that for the average American, the risk does remain low.”

Government’s Mixed Messages on Coronavirus Are Dangerous: Experts/-/ABOVE: WIKIMEDIA, DANIEL MAYER
C
onflicting statements about the potential severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the US from government officials is dangerous, public health experts warn.
“It’s really important for the U.S. government to be speaking with one common voice about these issues right now,” Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases physician and director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells STAT. 
That’s not happening. On Tuesday (February 25), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official announced that COVID-19 could start spreading at the community level in the US shortly and that if the outbreak did hit the states, there could be “severe” disruptions to daily life. The next day, President Donald Trump held an evening press conference in which he said he didn’t think an outbreak in the US is inevitable. “I don’t think it’s inevitable because we’re doing a really good job in terms of maintaining borders and turning—in terms of letting people in, in terms of checking people,” he told reporters. He did not mention a new disease case reported the same day in California that couldn’t be accounted for by foreign travel or contact with someone known to be infected.
In the same press conference, Trump contradicted his own health officials. He predicted that there might be just one or two more people who report being infected in the next short period of time, yet, minutes later, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat both said that they expected the number of infections to grow. There are currently 60 reported cases of COVID-19 in the US. 
Earlier in February, Trump also said the spread of the virus could dissipate by April when the weather warms. While some viruses, such as the flu, don’t spread as easily in higher temperatures, it is not clear SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is one of them. Government officials saying that the coronavirus outbreak is just like the flu isn’t entirely accurate, notes Ronald Klain, who oversaw the Ebola response in President Barack Obama’s administration. He responded to comments Tuesday by Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in testimony before Congress. “The responsible answer [to whether the outbreak is like the flu] is ‘we don’t know yet,’” Klain said.
“Americans need facts and science—not reassurance that all will be well. The presidential press conference on the coronavirus pandemic was, sadly, a disappointment,” Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Health, says in a statement emailed to The Scientist.
Disagreement between the State Department and CDC about the decision to fly home 14 Americans infected with SARS-CoV-2 also led to questions about who was leading the effort to contain the disease in the US. The CDC recommended that the patients not be flown home from Tokyo after leaving quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, but the State Department overruled the recommendation, according to The Washington Post. 
Unmixing the messages
Government messaging may become more consistent, as President Trump announced Wednesday (February 26) that Vice President Mike Pence would be coordinating the response to the disease threat going forward. Now, government health officials and scientists are required to coordinate any statements and public appearances with Pence’s office, officials tell The New York Times reports. That includes Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
“Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama trusted Tony Fauci to be their top adviser on infectious disease, and the nation’s most trusted communicator to the public. If Trump is changing that, it is a threat to public health and safety,” Klain wrote on Twitter.
On Thursday (February 27), Pence announced Deborah Birx, who currently directs the US effort to combat HIV and AIDS, will be the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator. Azar remains the chairman of the government’s coronavirus task force, again leading to uncertainty.
“It is unclear who has the lead in responding to this epidemic. The Vice President? HHS Secretary Azar? The public needs a clear voice to give them factual information. The Vice President is not the appropriate person to lead. He solicits skepticism about matters of science because of past opinions that are viewed by many as anti-science or anti-public health. He is simply not a credible ‘czar’ to lead these efforts,” Caplan says.
Deficits of past decisions
In addition to making sure information from the administration is consistent, Pence and other coronavirus response leaders may face other challenges left lingering by Trump’s past decisions. It’s been two years since Trump disbanded the global health security team that was supposed to prepare the country for pandemics, such as what might develop from the new coronavirus outbreak. The President maintains he can build the response team he needs rapidly enough to counter a pandemic, but health experts aren’t so certain.
“You build a fire department ahead of time. You don’t wait for a fire,” Inglesby tells The Washington Post. “There is an underappreciation for the amount of time and resources required to build a prepared system.” To establish such a network, Trump will also have to rely on the very experts he’s criticized in the past, the Post reported in another piece.
There’s now also a whistleblower report claiming health workers who processed some of the repatriated citizens that had the virus or could have been exposed to it were not given proper safety gear to protect themselves from contracting SARS-CoV-2 and were not properly trained in how to monitor their own health until days after they’d interacted with potentially ill patients, the The New York Times reports.
The administration has requested $2.5 billion for emergency response efforts, but politicians from both parties have said the sum is not enough to combat a pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) countered the administration’s request with a proposal of $8.5 billion. The President indicated he would be willing to spend what was needed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also seemed to indicate more money could be appropriated for the response.
“There seems to be little question that COVID-19 will eventually cause some degree of disruption here,” McConnell tells NPR. As a result, Congress “must be prepared to work together.”

First US Case of Apparent SARS-CoV-2 Community Transmission/-/ABOVE: The University of California, Davis Medical Center
WIKIMEDIA, COOLCAESAR
T
he US Centers for Disease Control announced yesterday (February 26) that an infection with the novel coronavirus had been confirmed “in a person who reportedly did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient with COVID-19,” making it the first suspected US case of what is known as community transmission. Fifty-nine other cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the US, but all of them were linked to recent travel to affected areas abroad, including a cruise ship that experienced an outbreak, the Associated Press notes. 
“The thing that would immediately make all of us uneasy is if this person has no direct contact with someone who comes from an affected country,” William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, tells The New York Times. “That would suggest there are other undetected cases out there, and we have already started some low-grade transmission.”
The patient is being treated at the University of California (UC), Davis Medical Center. “We have been anticipating the potential for such a case in the U.S., and given our close familial, social and business relationships with China, it is not unexpected that the first case in the U.S. would be in California,” says Sonia Angell, the director of the California Department of Public Health, in a statement. 
According to a press release from UC Davis, doctors there wanted to test the patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, when the woman was first transferred from another California hospital last week. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had restricted testing to people who had traveled to China or had contact with someone who was infected with the virus. Four days later, the CDC ordered the test.
NorthBay VacaValley Hospital, where the patient was first admitted, is monitoring dozens of its staff members for signs of the disease, The Washington Post reports. The UC Davis Medical Center, which has treated other patients with COVID-19, noted in the release that infection prevention precautions have been in place there, but that a small number of employees have been asked to stay home and monitor themselves.
In a press conference today, California Governor Gavin Newsom noted that the state has a few hundred diagnostic kits available for COVID-19, which he called “simply inadequate.” The state is working with the CDC to make testing more readily available, he said.
At a press conference held yesterday, President Donald Trump announced that Vice President Mike Pence will lead the US response to COVID-19. The Post reports that Pence’s handling of an HIV outbreak in 2015 in Indiana, where he was governor at the time, has drawn criticism. He had initially pledged to veto any bill authorizing needle-exchange programs, for example, despite CDC assurances that such programs are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and other diseases. A modeling study later estimated that an earlier response to that outbreak could have prevented more than 100 infections.

Coronavirus Precautions Stifle Research/-/ABOVE: A banner on a street in Shanghai reminds residents who are returning to the city to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days.

O
n January 23, in the midst of the Spring Festival in China, which gives rise to the largest annual human migration, government officials in China shut down travel in and out of Wuhan—a major transportation hub and the center of the emerging COVID-19 outbreak—with only a few hours’ notice. Over the next few days, several surrounding cities were quarantined as well.
Scientists are among the many stranded in China due to the strict measures enacted there and elsewhere. One US-based physicist, who asked to remain anonymous, says he’d traveled to Wuhan to visit family for the Lunar New Year. As of mid-February, he was still there, unsure of when he’d be able to go home and continue his research.
Since the outbreak began in December, 79,331 individuals have been infected and 2,618 have died. Almost all of the deaths (2,595) have been in China, but scientists have confirmed cases of the disease in 33 countries.
Many researchers in China are isolated in their homes, unable to visit their labs.
William Snyder, who studies linguistics at the University of Connecticut, was scheduled to attend a workshop in Wuhan this spring to meet graduate students and give a talk about his work, he tells The Scientist. He cancelled the trip in early January, as reports about COVID-19 became more “dire,” he says, and friends and family urged him to reconsider. By the time he made up his mind not to go, the scientist who had invited him had left Wuhan.
Now, he likely couldn’t go even if he wanted to as many commercial airlines have stopped flights from the US to China, and countries around the world have restricted travel to and from the county.
The US issued travel restrictions on January 31, preventing non-citizens who had recently visited China from entering the US. Those who are permitted to enter are funneled through certain major airports where they can be screened, and may either be quarantined or required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Australia followed suit on February 1, determining that travelers who have been to China would not be able to enter the country until February 14—a date that has since been extended to at least February 29. More than 50 other countries have enacted their own restrictions.
The quarantines and travel bans have been controversial, with the World Health Organization questioning their efficacy, though recent data suggest they may have allowed the world more time to prepare and helped reduce the disease’s spread.
One of the many effects of the restrictions is a stifled research environment, felt not only by scientists in China but also by those who collaborate with researchers there. Conference organizers have cancelled or postponed several events in Asia and Europe, including the Asia-Europe Sustainable Connectivity Scientific Conference and the Alzheimer’s Disease International Conference.
Many researchers in China are isolated in their homes, unable to visit their labs, according to a Nature poll, and several research labs and institutes are closed. Mu-ming Poo, a neuroscientist at the Chinese Academy of Science’s Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology in Shanghai, tells Science that experimental research there “is largely halted at present because students and research staff are not allowed to return to the laboratories.” Instead, he’s giving neuroscience lectures to his students online.
Some researchers may end up having to restart entire experiments, putting them months behind original plans. Jeffrey Erlich, a neuroscientist at New York University, Shanghai, trains animals to study how they complete complex tasks. He tells Science he’s negotiating ways to continue his work because if he has to stop, he’ll need to “order another batch of animals and start from scratch, and that would put me back another 6 to 9 months.” 
COVID-19 has continued to spread, and its effects on research may expand beyond projects in China—and, of course, science is just one aspect of life facing disruption. “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but more really a question of when it will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness,” Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday morning about disease circulation in the US. She suggested that the US may need to close schools and workplaces, adding that “disruption to everyday life may be severe.”

Coronavirus’s Genetics Reveal Its Global Travels/-/ABOVE: The viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 reveal its path around the globe. The circles mark the size of outbreaks in different regions and the colored lines represent which strain clusters spread to those regions. The map includes data collected up to February 15.

S
everal years ago, Richard Neher, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland, and his colleagues wanted to monitor changes to the flu’s genetic makeup to see if the data would help scientists build more-effective flu vaccines. They developed an online interface that integrated the latest viral sequencing data, analyzed it, and published the results in a publicly available interactive web browser. 
“Then we thought, why just flu, why not other viruses?” Neher says. The team built a similar platform to chart the transmission of MERS and Ebola and called the site NextStrain.org. Now, they’ve adapted it to keep track of the genetic tweaks to SARS-CoV-2 as it spreads around the globe and chart the viral lineages on world maps to watch, in nearly real time, as the virus moves from major hotspots in China to smaller pockets in other countries.
Here, Neher talks with The Scientist about what NextStrain.org has uncovered about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
The Scientist: How do viral genomes’ sequences from swabs taken from infected patients help you build a family tree of the virus?
Richard Neher: These coronavirsuses tend to change their genome, they mutate, at a fairly high rate. These mutations allow us to group viruses into more closely related viruses and less closely related viruses. All the sequences on the site are super similar because they were closely related. As time goes on, the lineages pick up independent mutations, and then they cause outbreaks in different parts of the world. You can group these sequences together by genetic makeup and reconstruct the transmission tree of the virus.
There are 70,000 reported cases so the number of infections could be 200,000. It could be 500,000.
TS: Can you estimate the number of infections from the tree? 
RN: Yes, if you look at the viral tree you see different sequences. And the tree will have different shapes depending on if the outbreak it’s staying the same size or growing. If it’s growing, you see many, many lineages coming together very deep in the tree, and that’s what we have here. That implies there was rapid expansion at the base of the tree that drove all of the lineages apart. You can estimate the rate of that expansion and if you know how old the outbreak is, you can estimate the number of infections.
TS: What kind of estimates do you get using this technique? 
RN: It’s a little difficult to interpret the numbers from China right now. The dynamics are changing; the cases are plateauing. We expect this to be a result of these draconian containment measures or quarantine measures that they imposed on half a billion people. There are 70,000 reported cases so the number of infections could be 200,000. It could be 500,000. We don’t know because people may be sick at home and stay home because the hospitals are overcrowded and that’s where you could get infected. I don’t think we have a good handle on how many cases there were that simply don’t show up in any statistic. I would [estimate] some three-fold underreporting at least.
TS: What can the data tell you about the virus’s origins?
RN: The first takeaway is that all these sequences are very, very similar, about eight mutations different than the root. That’s eight mutations in a 30,000-base sequence. What this tells us is that the virus came from one source, not too long ago, somewhere between mid-November and early December.
There’s not much doubt it will become a pandemic.
TS: Can the mutation data tell you if the virus is becoming more virulent?
RN: We can see where the mutations change codons and where they change amino acids. Most of the mutations are probably completely inconsequential. They just happen; it’s at a rate of about one mutation per month. But we are keeping an eye on mutations that might make a difference.
TS: How do the viral lineages help you track transmission of the disease?
RN: The mutations cluster similar transmissions together. So, families that had the virus tend to share a similar viral mutation because they had the same virus. They’re a transmission cluster. So you can watch the clusters and see where they go around the world and map that spread. If you then sequence viral genomes in a new region, say, Italy, where the virus has spread, and they all were part of the same cluster, we could be reasonably confident that there was one introduction of the virus in the region. But if the viral genomes are from different clusters, that would mean there are lots of seeding events, which then make small clusters there.
TS: Does NextStrain give you any hints about the severity of outbreaks and whether the outbreaks will become a pandemic?
RN: It doesn’t really give you information on severity of outbreaks. It does tell you how different outbreaks group together and how local different outbreaks are. And so if you ask me, there’s not much doubt it will become a pandemic.

As Global Coronavirus Cases Climb, More Areas on Lockdown/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, POWEROFFLOWERS
T
he number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, now sits at 79,4361, with 28 countries reporting documented illnesses, the World Health Organization reported today (February 24). The disease has killed 2,618 people in China and 23 people in other countries.
As more countries report new cases, South Korea, the country second hardest hit by the disease, has changed its national threat level to “red alert” and is prepared to implement lockdowns of affected cities and travel restrictions. Cases there had topped 600 with six deaths as of yesterday, NPR reports, with many new cases among members of a secretive Christian sect, according to the Los Angeles Times. It is the first time the country has issued a red alert since the outbreak of H1N1 swine flu in 2009.
Iran also reported a rapid rise in cases, with the outbreak there first reported February 19. Now there are 43 confirmed cases in the country and 12 people have died. “The concern is . . . that we have seen . . . a very rapid increase in a matter of a few days,” Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO’s global infectious hazard preparedness department, told RFI.
A spike in cases appeared in Italy as well, forcing cities into lockdown; 219 confirmed cases have been reported there as of today, according to Angelo Borrelli, the head of the Civil Protection Agency and coordinator of the country’s coronavirus emergency response, the New York Times reports.
Trying to isolate carriers of the disease with a connection to China is no longer an effective strategy to contain the disease, Veneto regional president Luca Zaia told reporters, according to NPR. That’s because the virus is transmitted like the flu. “You can get it from anyone,” Zaia said. “We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact [with possible carriers].”
A study published today (February 24) in eLife suggests Zaia may be right. Through mathematical modeling, the authors found that diagnostic screening to contain the outbreak will miss more than half of infected people. “Most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because [individuals] have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed,” the authors write. “Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being missed by a screening program.” 
Those travelers could be key to preventing a global pandemic, though health officials aren’t certain that is possible anymore. “The window of opportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing in Geneva on February 21. “We have to prepare at the same time for any eventualities because this outbreak could go any direction.”

Why Some COVID-19 Cases Are Worse than Others/-/ABOVE: Colored visualization of electron microscopy photo of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

L
ike many other respiratory conditions, COVID-19—the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2—can vary widely among patients. The vast majority of confirmed cases are considered mild, involving mostly cold-like symptoms to mild pneumonia, according to the latest and largest set of data on the new coronavirus outbreak released February 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.   
Fourteen percent of confirmed cases have been “severe,” involving serious pneumonia and shortness of breath. Another 5 percent of patients confirmed to have the disease developed respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multi-organ failure—what the agency calls “critical cases” potentially resulting in death. Roughly 2.3 percent of confirmed cases did result in death.  
Scientists are working to understand why some people suffer more from the virus than others. It is also unclear why the new coronavirus—like its cousins SARS and MERS—appears to be more deadly than other coronaviruses that regularly circulate among people each winter and typically cause cold symptoms. “I think it’s going to take a really, really long time to understand the mechanistic, biological basis of why some people get sicker than others,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.  
In the meantime, the latest data from China and research on other coronaviruses provide some hints. 
Elderly and sick people are most susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19
The latest data from China stem from an analysis of nearly 45,000 confirmed cases, and on the whole suggest that the people most likely to develop severe forms of COVID-19 are those with pre-existing illnesses and the elderly.
While less than 1 percent of people who were otherwise healthy died from the disease, the fatality rate for people with cardiovascular disease was 10.5 percent. That figure was 7.3 percent for diabetes patients and around 6 percent for those with chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, or cancer. 
While overall, 2.3 percent of known cases proved fatal—which many experts say is likely an overestimate of the mortality rate, given that many mild cases might go undiagnosed—patients 80 years or older were most at risk, with 14.8 percent of them dying. Deaths occurred in every age group except in children under the age of nine, and, generally speaking, “we see relatively few cases among children,” World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week.
This pattern of increasing severity with age differs from that of some other viral outbreaks, notably the 1918 flu pandemic, for which mortality was high in young children and in people between 20 and 40 years of age. However, it’s broadly consistent with records of the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks, notes Lisa Gralinski, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “If you’re over fifty or sixty and you have some other health issues and if you’re unlucky enough to be exposed to this virus, it could be very bad,” she says. 
I think it’s going to take a really, really long time to understand the mechanistic, biological basis of why some people get sicker than others.
—Angela Rasmussen, Columbia University
Scientists don’t know what exactly happens in older age groups. But based on research on other respiratory viruses, experts theorize that whether a coronavirus infection takes a turn for the worse depends on a person’s immune response. “The virus matters, but the host response matters at least as much, and probably more,” says Stanley Perlman, a virologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa.
Once SARS-CoV-2 gets inside the human respiratory tract, it’s thought to infect and multiply in cells lining the airway, causing damage that kicks the immune system into action. In most people, it should trigger a wave of local inflammation, recruiting immune cells in the vicinity to eradicate the pathogen. The immune response then recedes, and patients recover. 
For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, some people—especially the elderly and sick—may have dysfunctional immune systems that fail to keep the response to particular pathogens in check. This could cause an uncontrolled immune response, triggering an overproduction of immune cells and their signaling molecules and leading to a cytokine storm often associated with a flood of immune cells into the lung. “That’s when you end up with a lot of these really severe inflammatory disease conditions like pneumonia, shortness of breath, inflammation of the airway, and so forth,” says Rasmussen. 
Local inflammation can turn into widespread inflammation of the lungs, which then has ripple effects across all organs of the body. This could also happen if the virus replicates faster than the immune system can respond, so that it then has to play catch-up to contain the pathogen—a situation that could also cause the immune defense to spiral out of control. “With mice, we know that in some cases, particularly for SARS and MERS coronaviruses, virus replication is very rapid and in some cases overwhelming” to the immune system, says Perlman.  
It’s harder to explain why young, healthy people also sometimes die from the disease—for instance, Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor who first sounded the alarm about the virus. He died a few weeks after contracting the pathogen.
Genetic and environmental risk factors might help explain the severity of infections. Though it’s clear that genetic factors can strongly determine the outcome of viral infections in mice—as some of Rasmussen’s work has shown for Ebola, for instance—researchers haven’t yet been able to tease out specific genes or variants in mice, let alone in people, that are responsible for varying degrees of illness. Environmental factors, such as smoking or air quality, may also play a role in disease severity, Rasmussen adds.
A lot of research has gone into understanding what causes respiratory failure that results from systemic inflammation of the lungs—also called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—that can occur from coronaviruses and other infections. Yet researchers still don’t know how it occurs exactly, let alone how to treat it, Gralinksi notes. “It’s still a really poorly understood issue.”  
Men might be more affected by COVID-19 than women
An intriguing finding in the new data released last week is that although similar numbers of men and women have contracted SARS-CoV-2, more men are dying from the disease. The death rate for males was 2.8 percent and 1.7 percent for women. Rasmussen is quick to caution that although the data encompass nearly 45,000 patients, “that’s still not that many people to determine if there’s really a gender bias—you’d have to look at this in a much larger population of patients in a number of different countries,” she says. 
That said, if there is a bias, it would be consistent with what epidemiologists have observed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks. In the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, for instance, nearly 22 percent of infected men died, compared to around 13 percent of women. In an analysis of MERS infections between 2017 and 2018, around 32 percent of men died, and nearly 26 percent of women. The difference could have something to do with the fact that the gene for the ACE-2 receptor, which is used by both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS virus to enter host cells, is found on the X chromosome, she speculates. If it’s a particular variant of the protein that makes people more susceptible to the virus, then females could compensate for that one bad variant because they’d have two copies of the X chromosome, whereas men would be stuck with only one copy. Or, “it could be that men are more likely to be smokers and so their lungs are already a bit compromised. There’s definitely more to be teased out there,” Gralinski says. 
Some of Perlman’s research, which demonstrated that the sex disparity also holds true in SARS-infected mice, points to the hormone estrogen as possibly having protective effects: Removing the ovaries of infected female mice or blocking the estrogen receptor made the animals more likely to die compared to infected control mice. The effects are probably more pronounced in mice than in people, Perlman tells The New York Times. 
Does an infection make people immune to the virus?
Whether patients develop antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection that will protect them against future infections is still a mystery. Surveys of SARS patients around five or 10 years after their recovery suggest that the coronavirus antibodies don’t persist for very long, Gralinski says. “They found either very low levels or no antibodies that were able to recognize SARS proteins.” 
However, for the new coronavirus, “we would expect some immunity, at least in the short term,” she says. 
Why different coronaviruses vary in severity
There are seven coronaviruses known to infect people. Four of them—229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1—typically cause a cold and only rarely result in death. The other three—MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the new SARS-CoV-2—have varying degrees of lethality. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, 10 percent of infected people died. Between 2012 and 2019, MERS killed 23 percent of infected people. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower, the virus has already killed more people than the other two outbreaks combined, which some have attributed to the pathogen’s fast transmission.  
See “How COVID-19 is Spread”
The cold-causing coronaviruses, as well as many other viruses that cause common colds, are typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract, that is, the nose and sinuses. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, however, are capable of invading deep into the lungs, something that is associated with more severe disease.  
One possible reason for this is that the virus binds to the ACE-2 receptor on human cells in order to gain entry. This receptor is present in ciliated epithelial cells in the upper and lower airway, as well as in type II pneumocytes, which reside in the alveoli in the lower airway and produce lung-lubricating proteins. “The type II pneumocytes are . . . important for lung function, so this is part of why the lower respiratory disease can be so severe,” notes Gralinksi. 
The new coronavirus also appears to use the ACE-2 receptor, which may help partially explain why, like SARS, it is more deadly than the other four coronaviruses. Those pathogens use different receptors, except for NL63, which also uses the ACE-2 receptor but binds to it with less affinity, says Gralinski. (MERS is thought to use an entirely different receptor, which is also present in the lower airways.) 
Sustained interest required
To understand these questions fully will take time, research, and consistent funding for long-term studies. Coronavirus funding has been criticized for following a boom-and-bust cycle; viral spillovers from animals to people cause an initial surge of interest that tends to wane until the next outbreak occurs, Rasmussen warns. 
“I’m hopeful that in this case it will be really apparent to everybody in the world that we need to be funding this type of basic science, fundamental science, to understand these mechanisms of disease,” she says. “Otherwise, we’re going to be in the same situation when the next outbreak happens—whether it’s a coronavirus or something else.”

Newer Vaccine Technologies Deployed to Develop COVID-19 Shot/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, BUSRACAVUS
T
he Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported on February 20 that the novel coronavirus illness known as COVID-19 has now infected nearly 75,000 people and that the number of fatalities in China has doubled since February 11, from 1,016 to 2,118. Amid uncertainty about the course of the outbreak, researchers in academia and industry are using a variety of approaches in their urgency to develop a vaccine that will work to contain the virus.
When COVID-19 came on the scene, David Weiner, the director of the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, and his group were already part of a project led by pharmaceutical company Inovio to develop a DNA-based vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is caused by a coronavirus. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), whose mission is to accelerate development of vaccines in epidemic situations, funds that project and reached out to Inovio and Weiner to discuss extending the collaboration to vaccine development efforts for the new coronavirus. They agreed and CEPI announced the expanded funding—up to $56 million—on January 23.
“We had been paying very close attention to the [COVID-19] cases increasing over Christmas in China,” Weiner tells The Scientist. As soon as the COVID-19 genetic sequences became available in January, Weiner’s team, and collaborators from Inovio, Université Laval, the National Institutes of Health’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories, and elsewhere, started designing DNA cassettes that encode proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
See “How COVID-19 Is Spread”
Their basic approach to vaccine design is to change the nucleotide sequences of these genes to modify the predicted mRNA structures for optimal expression once inside people so that these transcripts abundantly produce the antigens people’s immune systems will recognize. The DNA is injected intramuscularly, then brief electric pulses applied to the site via small needles make the cell membranes more permeable to the genetic material. Then the human cells make viral mRNA and protein from the construct, thereby priming the immune system to fight the virus.
No one can really be sure what will work, but you tend to want to focus on things that are important for [cellular] entry.
—David Weiner, Wistar Institute
When the group at Wistar and their collaborators went through a similar process for MERS, they chose about 14 different viral proteins and put their corresponding genes together in different combinations that they tested for effectiveness in different cell types. In that case, they went through all the steps, from synthetic DNA to a Phase 1 clinical trial, in about 11 months. The results, published in 2019, showed immune responses to the vaccine, such as the production of neutralizing antibodies and the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, also known as killer T cells. There were no serious adverse events, and a Phase 2 trial is in the works.
In terms of choosing which viral proteins will produce the best immune response, “no one can really be sure what will work, but you tend to want to focus on things that are important for entry,” Weiner says. For instance, the spike proteins that are common to coronaviruses are a good place to start.
“Having the genome sequence allows you to design vaccines for this that are likely to work [based on] what we know about other coronaviruses. The genome sequencing is absolutely crucial,” says Rachel Roper, a biologist at East Carolina University and former program director for the British Columbia Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Accelerated Vaccine Initiative who is not currently involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.
In the same January 23 announcement, CEPI formalized funding for two other COVID-19 vaccine development projects: an unspecified amount to a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Moderna, a biotech company based in Cambridge, MA, for the development of an mRNA-based vaccine, and up to $10.6 million to the University of Queensland. The Australian team is working on a vaccine composed of synthetic viral proteins with an added stabilization domain called a molecular clamp. The idea is that by holding the synthetic proteins in the conformation that so-called viral fusion proteins maintain before they merge with a host cell, the molecular clamp allows for better recognition of these proteins by the host immune system, leading to greater vaccine efficacy.
On February 18, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur publicized a collaboration to develop their own version of a recombinant protein–based vaccine. Sanofi is already the maker of Flublok, an influenza vaccine built on this approach that is licensed in the US. BARDA will also collaborate with pharmaceutical company Janssen on a project to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
The need for speed
On January 31, CEPI announced another funding expansion of up to $8.3 million, this time to CureVac, a German pharmaceutical company that also develops mRNA-based vaccines. CureVac was already in the midst of a three-year, $34-million award from CEPI to develop an mRNA printer capable of producing thousands of doses of mRNA vaccine encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.
CureVac is simultaneously producing different candidate vaccines that they’ll test in mice soon and making corresponding candidate vaccines that are of the quality for clinical studies in humans.
“For situations like this one—where you have an outbreak of something that is brand new . . . that was not known to infect humans before—you can then immediately take the code and use the platform that we have to quickly make a vaccine against that virus,” says Lidia Oostvogels, a vice president and area head of infectious diseases at CureVac. “We just need to make messenger RNA, so that is an advantage in an outbreak situation.”
The CureVac team is choosing the viral targets for its mRNA vaccine based on past success. A study the team did in mice for testing a MERS vaccine showed that the technology did induce antibodies against the MERS coronavirus, so they’re starting with what worked then. And to move more quickly, they’re doing things in parallel that they normally would do sequentially. They’ve produced the different candidate vaccines that they’ll test in mice soon, but they are also simultaneously making corresponding candidate vaccines that are of the quality for clinical studies in humans.
“We are making several different candidates because of course we cannot predict exactly which one will be the best,” Oostvogels tells The Scientist. She acknowledges that they will likely end up throwing out some of their options, but acting in parallel will help them to move into Phase 1 clinical trials as early as the beginning of summer. Then, they might have an idea about whether the vaccine induces an immune response by the end of the summer.
It’s not predictable whether the novel coronavirus will spread even further, fade away as SARS did, or perhaps become seasonal like the flu, says Oostvogels. In the case of a seasonal virus, researchers might be able to take more time, on the order of years, to develop a vaccine. It depends “how this disease develops and how this epidemic develops. That will guide how authorities and developers will bring this to the population.”
Oostvogels’s team has shown for other viruses that very low amounts of mRNA packaged in nanoparticles and injected into mice are translated into protein that is able to induce a functional immune response, she adds. “This makes us very hopeful that we would be able to also produce large quantities of the vaccine. If this is a global health threat and you need to vaccinate large parts of the population, you need to have lots of vaccine. It is a lot of work, but it is important and people are dying.”
Another challenge to vaccine development is that the degree of immune response can vary, and it’s not always clear what type of immune reaction will benefit people during infections. Previous work showed that levels of neutralizing antibodies present in MERS patients did not necessarily correlate with the degree of killer T cell responses or outcomes. Because little is known about COVID-19, it’s not clear yet what readouts will best predict vaccine success.
“It’s a great idea to pursue multiple strategies and platforms because we really don’t know what will work best,” Roper says. As such, there are numerous other vaccine endeavors, including testing already existing MERS vaccines to determine their effectiveness for the new coronavirus and a vaccine candidate developed in a collaboration between scientists at NIAID and Oxford University.

How COVID-19 Is Spread/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, LEWISTSEPUILUNG
T
he global outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is approaching the end of its second month amid widespread confusion among members of the public about how the virus is transmitted.
“There’s a massive amount of education that clearly hasn’t reached the public about this stuff,” says Ian Mackay, a public health virologist at the University of Queensland who helped develop diagnostics for COVID-19 in Australia. As is the case for many aspects of COVID-19 biology, “there are a lot of knowledge gaps out there in the community.”
With researchers around the world working to understand the pathology of the disease and slow its spread, The Scientist rounded up the latest on what is and isn’t known about how the virus is transmitted from person to person.
See “Follow the Coronavirus Outbreak”
The main route of transmission for COVID-19
Like the flu, COVID-19 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets—little blobs of liquid released as someone coughs, sneezes, or talks. Viruses contained in these droplets can infect other people via the eyes, nose, or mouth—either when they land directly on somebody’s face or when they’re transferred there by people touching their face with contaminated hands.
Because respiratory droplets are too heavy to remain suspended in the air, direct person-to-person transmission normally only happens when people are in close contact—within about six feet of each other, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It could also occur in a medical setting, if someone has to handle respiratory secretions such as saliva or mucus from an infected person.
People should be taking the same precautions that they would anyway during flu season.
—Elizabeth McGraw, Penn State University
Initial reports from China state that the majority of transmissions have occurred either among family members or between patients and health workers, says David Heymann, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who led the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global response to the SARS outbreak in 2003.
It might also be possible for the virus to be transferred via surfaces contaminated by respiratory droplets or other secretions from an infected person, notes Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University. A paper published in The Journal of Hospital Infection earlier this month by researchers in Germany concluded that, based on previous studies of viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, at least some human coronaviruses could remain infective on materials such as metal, glass, or plastic for up to nine days. Ethanol or hydrogen peroxide solutions disinfected the surfaces within one minute, the researchers note in their paper.
See “Scientists Compare Novel Coronavirus to SARS and MERS viruses”
McGraw emphasizes that it’s not clear whether SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted in this way, nor how long the virus can remain infective outside the body. Researchers who spoke to The Scientist say they expect data on that very question to be published soon.
The facts on face masks to prevent COVID-19 transmission
© ISTOCK.COM, RECEP-BG
Although the chance of encountering COVID-19 outside China is still very low, global public demand for face masks has soared in recent weeks, with health-care workers warning of shortages and thieves breaking into hospitals to steal supplies.
The most commonly worn masks are surgical masks, loose-fitting pieces of cloth that cover the nose and mouth. These are frequently worn by doctors and dentists, and are designed to help protect other people and the environment from the mask-wearer by trapping respiratory droplets emitted from the mouth or nose.
The CDC only recommends these masks for people who are already infected with SARS-CoV-2, so as “to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes,” according to the agency’s website.
A 2019 study of health-care workers exposed to the flu suggested that surgical masks may also provide the wearer with some protection from respiratory illness—probably by reducing the number of times a person touches their face, according to researchers. However, the CDC notes that frequent incorrect usage and the slippage of masks when people breathe or talk make them ineffective as protection from respiratory pathogens.
Surgical masks are not the same as N95 respirators, tight-fitting face protection that filters out airborne particles including viruses and bacteria. N95 respirators are worn by health workers at risk of inhaling hazardous particles, need to be professionally fitted, and are not recommended by the CDC for members of the public.
Instead, McGraw says, the best protective measures are the ones recommended for the common cold or the flu. “People should be taking the same precautions that they would anyway during flu season,” she says, including washing hands frequently and avoiding touching their faces. And “if you’re not well, self-isolate, don’t go to work.”
Transmissibility and the mislabeled “superspreader”
Researchers use what’s known as the basic reproduction number, R0, to describe how transmissible a disease is in the absence of any special quarantining or social distancing measures.
Research on other respiratory viruses suggests that there may be biological reasons that some people seem to transmit disease more easily.
—James Lloyd-Smith, University of California, Los Angeles
R0 estimates for COVID-19 are currently based on limited data, but most have so far fallen between 2 and 3. That means that a typical infected person is expected to pass the disease to two or three other people, McGraw explains.
The R0 is, by definition, an average value. “What it misses is the fact that not everybody is average,” says James Lloyd-Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who researches disease transmission and adaptation. “There is a lot of variation among individuals in terms of how much they transmit.”
For instance, one British man who contracted COVID-19 in Singapore was linked to a further 11 cases after he made a trip to a ski resort in France in late January. Earlier this week, a woman in South Korea was linked to as many as 15 new cases after she attended a church and then visited a hospital. These people have been referred to as “superspreaders” by some epidemiologists and media outlets.
Research on other respiratory viruses suggests that there may be biological reasons that some people seem to transmit disease more easily , says Lloyd-Smith, who studied the impact of superspreading during the SARS outbreak. For example, some infected people just make more virus than other people do, he says, “whether that’s something about the genetics, prior immune status, possible cross-immunity from something else. . . . It may have to do with their initial infection—whether they had a high-dose or low-dose exposure.”
There’s also variation in the size of respiratory droplets that people, through no fault of their own, produce as they breathe or talk, says Lloyd-Smith. Size can help determine how a droplet moves through the air, how likely it is to reach another person, and whether it makes it to that person’s airways. Larger droplets are heavier and fall out of the air faster, for example, but may last longer than smaller droplets before evaporating.
Additionally, for many illnesses, “there’s a lot of difference in the severity of symptoms people show,” Lloyd-Smith says. “This has a direct impact on transmission, because how sick versus well you feel will determine whether you’re out moving around in the world, doing all your normal stuff, contacting lots of people, or whether you’re at home feeling crappy, or self-isolating because you’re aware you might be an infection risk.”
There are also many non-biological factors that influence the probability a disease will spread, from the number of people at a particular gathering, to their susceptibility of catching the disease, to the types of interactions those people are having. For instance, during the West African Ebola epidemic, which claimed more than 11,000 lives between 2013 and 2016, at least some new chains of transmission are thought to have started at unsafe burials, in which lots of people came into close contact with the body of an infected person and with one another.
Partly because of these contextual factors, Heymann says, the term “superspreaders” is misleading and unhelpful. “It’s not the person, it’s the situation.” He adds that, at the moment, there isn’t any evidence to suggest there is variation in how people spread COVID-19. The current understanding is that “it’s a difference in who is exposed, and what numbers are exposed to a person who’s transmitting.”
McGraw agrees that “superspreaders” fails to capture the complexity of transmission, adding that the term should not be used to stigmatize people linked to more cases than usual. “It’s better to try and extract the idea of this being responsibility of an individual out of that scenario, and think more about [transmission events] as being context-dependent,” she says. “Because if we think about them as very contextualized, we have a better chance of trying to shut down transmission.”
Are there other ways COVID-19 could spread?
One proposed alternative route SARS-CoV-2 may take to reach a new host is fecal-oral transmission, which is thought to have played a role in the spread of SARS. In Hong Kong, for example, “there was a huge outbreak [of SARS] due to an infected individual who lived on the top of an apartment building whose sewage caused a blockage,” says Heymann. The blockage is thought to have subsequently contaminated the bathing areas of people living on the floors below, leading to many new cases.
A change in mode of transmission is a big deal for a virus. It’s a bit like growing an extra arm for us, or another eye.
—Ian Mackay, University of Queensland
Recent reports of a similar situation with COVID-19, in which people on different floors of an apartment building in Hong Kong were diagnosed with the disease, led to concerns that fecal-oral transmission might be occurring for SARS-CoV-2. A couple of studies from researchers in China also recently documented viral RNA in the feces of infected people.
On their own, these observations don’t show that COVID-19 is spread via feces. Viral RNA can often be present without the virus being infective, Heymann says.
A couple weeks ago, a few news organizations also reported concerns about vertical transmission (in which a mother passes the virus to her fetus or newborn) after a woman in Wuhan with COVID-19 gave birth to a baby who was later diagnosed with the disease. Some viruses are transmitted vertically: Zika virus, for example, can infect a fetus via the placenta, while HIV can be passed through breastmilk.
Newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 are more likely to have caught the illness through the usual means—that is, close contact and exchange of virus-carrying respiratory droplets, says Mackay. “There do seem to be fairly good indications that those infections were acquired at birth, rather than in utero, because there were infected people such as a mother or a nanny who were in close proximity.”
One recent study of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 failed to find evidence of vertical transmission. In a paper published in The Lancet, the researchers reported that, in all nine cases, amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and the newborn babies tested negative for the virus. “Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy,” the authors conclude in their paper.
Another potential mode of viral spread, airborne transmission, was discussed by a Shanghai official in early February. When airborne, infective virus can drift through the air as an aerosol. In this form of transmission, “very small droplets that come out of our mouth very quickly evaporate the water off, and we’re left with a gel kind of material . . . that forms a bit of a protective environment for those virions to survive for longer,” Mackay explains. This is distinct from droplet-based spread of the virus.
Viruses such as measles that do show airborne transmission can spread further than viruses transmitted in respiratory droplets. But Mackay says that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is spread through airborne transmission. Within 24 hours of the Shanghai official’s comments, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention had put out a statement emphasizing that there was no indication that SARS-CoV-2 is spread in this way.
It’s possible, though not very likely for the time being, that SARS-CoV-2 will adopt a new mode of transmission as it evolves, Mackay says. “A change in mode of transmission is a big deal for a virus,” he says. “It’s a bit like growing an extra arm for us, or another eye.”
Given the ease with which it’s currently spreading via respiratory droplets, he adds, “at the moment, I don’t think the virus really needs to adapt too much further to its ability to transmit from human to human. It’s doing a really good job right now.”

HELIN LOIK-TOMSON 
In clinical studies worldwide, researchers are testing the possibility that supplements of the vitamin could prevent or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Research Slated for Fall Will Stumble Without Undergraduates
COREY GARZA/CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, MONTEREY BAY 
While many universities weigh a return to in-person classes this fall, research progress in the fall could be stymied if students continue to shelter in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or if labs remain shuttered even when campuses reopen. Undergraduates in particular are important contributors to ongoing research, scientists say, but their return hinges on the virus’s progression over the summer. “If my students aren’t in lab, the research just can’t happen,” says Annaliese Franz, a chemist at University of California, Davis.
Seeking an Early COVID-19 Drug, Researchers Look to Interferons
BENJAMIN NILSSON-PAYANT (BENJAMIN TENOEVER LABORATORY)  
There are no drugs approved yet to be given early in a SARS-CoV-2 infection or preventively to those at high risk. In such a bleak therapeutic scenario, mounting evidence from laboratory studies and a couple of clinical trials on IFNs, either alone or in combination with other antivirals, suggests that synthetic IFNs might be able to fill in this gap. While IFN specialists posit that type I and III IFN drugs are attractive therapeutic options in COVID-19, they disagree about which of the two would be most suitable in COVID-19, and experimental evidence indicates that both types have potential.
Could COVID-19 Trigger Chronic Disease in Some People?
© ISTOCK.COM, PONOMARIOVA_MARIA 
“Long-haulers” point to the possibility that COVID-19 is not just a transient respiratory disease, but could manifest as neurological and physical symptoms that persist even months after people fall ill. Although many of them may yet recover in the coming months, some scientists are becoming increasingly worried that some may end up with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating and poorly understood condition associated with some viral infections.  
Saliva Tests: How They Work and What They Bring to COVID-19
COURTESY OF ZEV WILLIAMS/COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
The first spit tests are already being sold to consumers, with more poised to apply for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon. While saliva can be a crude sample for diagnosing disease using traditional PCR, it pairs well with a cheap PCR alternative known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), previously used to detect outbreaks of Zika and Ebola in resource-poor countries. Propelled by a global pandemic, researchers in the US and the UK are now modifying LAMP and assessing its utility as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19.

eurosurgeon Liu Zhiming, who served as the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, died from COVID-19 earlier today (February 18) at age 51, China Daily reports. The hospital is one of seven within the region specified to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Liu had been caring for them since the beginning of the outbreak in December.
“Unfortunately he became infected and passed away at 10:54 Tuesday morning after all-out efforts to save him failed,” the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission explains in a statement, according to news reports. Liu made “important contributions in the work of fighting and controlling” the virus.
Liu is the eighth frontline health-care worker to die from the virus during the current outbreak. Nurse Liu Fan, who also worked at Wuchang Hospital, died last week, and Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist whose early warnings of the outbreak were silenced by government officials, died February 7. 
As of February 11, there have been 1,716 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among health-care workers in the Wuhan region, but The Washington Post reports that the number could be as high as 3,000.
This large number of medical staff members who have contracted the virus might indicate a failure in containment policies or even that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is being spread more easily. The Associated Press reports the commission is “highly concerned” by this number. 
“There are risks—there simply aren’t enough resources,” Yu Yajie, an administrator at Wuhan Central Hospital, tells The New York Times. Yu, who is currently bedridden after becoming infected, has said that a lack of supplies has forced workers to reuse single-use items, make repairs to masks and goggles using tape, and even don plastic bags in lieu of proper foot coverings.

The Latest Drug Trials for Coronavirus/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, NARVIKK
A
round 100 clinical trials are in the works to treat COVID-19, the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, in China, with other trials starting in Japan, Thailand, and England. The virus has killed 1,772 people and infected more than 70,000 in China, according to the World Health Organization, with estimates of up to 200,000 infections, based on computer modeling by Trevor Bedford of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and his colleagues.
One of the trials already underway is in Shanghai, where doctors are taking blood plasma from patients who were sickened by the virus and recovered and infusing it into patients who are still ill. “We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,” Lu Hongzhou, co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, tells Reuters. A World Health Organization (WHO) official says the therapy is a “very valid” one to test, as long as the infusion is administered at just the right time to boost the ill patient’s immunity.
In Japan, doctors plan to use HIV antiretroviral drugs to treat patients infected COVID-19. The Japanese government is “currently conducting preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible,” Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, tells The Guardian. Limited evidence suggests the therapy could see some success. HIV drugs have reduced levels of coronaviruses such as those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in animal studies. And, doctors in Thailand treated a 70-year-old Chinese woman with a combination of HIV and flu antivirals; she reportedly recovered 48 hours after treatment. 
These drugs are being tested alongside 1,000-year-old traditional treatments, such as the Chinese herbal medicine shuanghuanglian, which contains extracts from the dried fruit lianqiao (Forsythiae fructus). 
The WHO is closely monitoring the trials and assisting with developing protocols so that the results of different experiments can be compared. Standards are being set for using a placebo treatment, measuring a person’s recovery or decline, and establishing other requirements so the trials have consistent structure, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan tells Nature. “Getting the clinical trials straight is a priority, since if we get information on what is working and not working, we can benefit patients now.”
Despite researchers’ best efforts, recruiting eligible patients into these clinical trials may not be as easy as drugmakers had anticipated. A clinical trial to test an antiviral drug produced by Gilead needs 700 patients to do the appropriate statistical analyses, yet in 10 days, only 200 individuals have been registered so far, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Another concern is that researchers will go to immense effort to begin these clinical trials only to see the scientific efforts dwindle after the outbreak ends. “I worry this will be the same situation as during SARS,” Shibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, tells Nature, “where the work starts, then stops.”

John D. Loike, a Professor of Biology at Touro College and University Systems, writes a regular column on bioethics for The Scientist.
S
ince December 2019, the spread of a new coronavirus from Wuhan, China, across the globe has been a primary news focus. It is often unclear where the public gets its information, but all kinds of erroneous material has been circulating—including online discussions about conspiracy theories and whether the virus comes from drinking Corona beer or eating Chinese food. One news report quoted a man describing how he cured himself of this virus with an inhaler, hot whiskey, and honey. As scientists, we can disregard these discussions, but their insidious spread may lead to fear and poor choices. 
I believe the scientific community has an ethical and social obligation to learn everything possible about this virus so that when asked about various circulating rumors, purported panaceas, and predicted doomsday scenarios by non-scientists, we can respond intelligently. Researchers know how to obtain reliable information from credible sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health. Many medical centers, including my own New York Medical Center of Touro College, have organized training sessions to educate their faculty and the public. Other medical centers across the globe should follow this lead.  
At the very least, we can instill public confidence in the ability of our scientists and physicians to effectively deal with the current epidemic.
It is critical to understand that 2019-nCoV, recently named SARS-CoV-2, is not an entirely new virus but is related to other RNA viruses that cause SARS, MERS, and colds. Importantly, our medical community has a lot of experience and knowledge to assess how these viruses spread, why they are contagious, their potential treatments, and how long it might take to develop a vaccine. Several reports have even presented data of potentially effective anti-viral treatments for this coronavirus. It is still too early to assess some encouraging news from China that indicates that the spread of this pathogen is abating in provinces other than Hubei, where it originated—a sign that the quarantine efforts in China may be working.
People should be more concerned about the flu epidemic that typically kills between 10,000 and 50,000 people in the US each year. It is estimated that more than 19 million people in the US have contracted influenza this season alone. It is critically important to encourage the public to get flu shots given that more than 80 percent of people who contract the flu were never vaccinated.
At this point in time, the CDC does not recommend wearing masks such as the N95 respirator type to avoid catching the virus, so people should not worry if stores have sold out. The most important preventive steps to convey to the public are to reduce viral transmission by washing hands several times a day with soap for at least 20 seconds and to avoid close contact with people who are sick. 
There are several reports claiming that scientists can be effective in quelling the spread of false rumors. In general, the public trusts scientists, and trust and credibility can potentially influence the ability to persuade people to follow public health authorities’ recommendations during a viral outbreak. This is not an easy task and there are many challenges that scientists face conveying their knowledge to the public. 
From a personal perspective, I find that many of my non-scientist peers respect my views on current medical challenges that we face, such as the importance of vaccinations, how society can affect climate change, and our capacity to address public health challenges like coronavirus. At the very least, we can instill public confidence in the ability of our scientists and physicians to effectively deal with the current epidemic.

he World Health Organization announced that the novel coronavirus disease, now known as COVID-19, was a public health emergency of international concern on January 30. By then, 9,826 cases and 213 deaths had been confirmed. Yesterday, February 12, those numbers rose to 45,171 cases and 1,115 deaths.
Scientists and medical professionals around the globe have been relying on freely available studies, resources, and datasets to quickly inform treatment strategies, public health initiatives, and drug development.
Even before the outbreak was declared an international public health emergency, researchers in the US and elsewhere commended the speed with which scientists in China shared the first genome of the 2019-nCoV virus, recently dubbed SARS-CoV-2. The first reports of the disease came from Wuhan at the end of December, and by January 8, scientists in China sequenced the viral genome and made it public. “Progress with research on this virus has been amazingly rapid,” says Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa.
We’re getting up to 20 submissions per day on coronavirus.
—Edward Campion, NEJM
On January 31 this year, a day after the novel coronavirus was designated a public health emergency of global concern, 94 academic journals, societies, institutes, and companies signed a commitment to making research and data on the disease freely available, at least for the duration of the outbreak.
“The responsible thing to do is to make all research freely available during epidemics or possibly pandemics where there are people at risk,” says Edward Campion, the executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), which signed on to the commitment. Papers on other diseases, “all of which are important,” he adds, remain behind a paywall. “It’s a balancing act. . . . Our expenses are paid mainly by subscribers.”
Other signatories, such as PLOS, are open-access all the time, charging fees to authors instead of readers. “PLOS is well-positioned to respond to any outbreak,” says Joerg Heber, the editor-in-chief of PLOS One. In addition to being open-access, the journal requires all data necessary to replicate the study to be published alongside it. Still, it takes time to peer-review studies, Heber adds, so PLOS “strongly encourages all researchers submitting coronavirus-related papers to us to post these as preprints so that they are available as soon as possible.”
While some paywalled journals have made studies free during previous outbreaks such as the 2009 flu pandemic, the WHO called for journals to develop special protocols for situations deemed to be global public health emergencies during the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. In the Fall of 2015, the WHO met with stakeholders from the BMJ, the Nature journals, the NEJM, and the seven PLOS journals, who all agreed in a statement that journals should “encourage or mandate public sharing of relevant data,” and that sharing said data—even before publication—should not prevent journals from accepting and publishing those authors’ studies.
Early in 2016, as Zika spread through the Americas, WHO released a bulletin stating that the “deficiencies in data-sharing mechanisms” were highlighted by the recent Ebola epidemic and called for publicly sharing not only clinical trial results, but all studies related to the illness along with all datasets used in those studies. On February 1, 2016, 57 journals and institutes signed a statement, similar to the one signed with regard to COVID-19, agreeing to share research on Zika. The agreement says the studies should remain free only for the duration of the emergency, but some journals keep the resources available indefinitely.
While many participating journals, such as NEJM and the BMJ rely on subscription fees for income, Campion says the journal doesn’t lose money at times like these, and Kieran Walsh, a clinical director at BMJ says, “we don’t think about commercial aspects during emergencies like this.”
Campion, Walsh, and Heber all tell The Scientist that the journals are putting in extra effort to expedite peer review of articles related to COVID-19. “We’re getting up to 20 submissions per day on coronavirus, some of which, frankly, are not high-quality reports,” says Campion. “Part of our responsibility is to select what we think is most important for our audience, for the clinical audience and public health audience.”

ccording to a February 11 report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV has infected more than 42,000 people and killed 1,016 in China since December. In a study published last week (February 7) in Cell Host & Microbe, researchers annotated three 2019-nCoV genomes and identified both differences and similarities compared with other genomes, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.
“It’s very helpful to know what the genome looks like and what the proteins look like,” says Rachel Roper, a biologist at East Carolina University who was part of the team that first analyzed and sequenced the SARS coronavirus genome in 2003 and did not participate in this study. “It gives us some idea about what protein differences may be that are allowing this virus to be so virulent and transmissible in humans.”
We’re all wondering where this virus came from, and we can see from the new sequence and the sequences that we’ve already had for coronaviruses that it’s likely to be a recombinant of a number of different coronaviruses that are known.
—Rachel Roper, East Carolina University
As of January 20, there were 14 genome sequences for 2019-nCoV that had been released by six different labs. Each is available to researchers through either the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Genbank or the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). While some research teams have done preliminary phylogenetic analysis and annotation, this report is one of the first in-depth looks at these genomes.
Taijiao Jiang, a computational biologist at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, and colleagues wanted to gain “insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functionality and pathogenesis of this novel virus,” he tells The Scientist in an email. They annotated three genomes of 2019-nCoV, which were sequenced from samples collected on December 30 and January 1 by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, part of the Chinese CDC and are available through GISAID.. Then they compared them to bat SARS-like coronaviruses, human SARS coronaviruses, and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoV).
The authors found that there were only five nucleotide differences—in a total genome of about 29,800 nucleotides—among the three 2019-nCoV genomes. They also identified 14 open reading frames, predicted to encode 27 proteins, including four structural and eight accessory proteins. Previous coronavirus research indicates that accessory proteins may mediate the host response to the virus, which can affect pathogenicity, and may make up part of the viral particle.
Because the researchers identified just five nucleotide differences among the genomes, it’s unlikely that there are any significant changes between the viruses that affect their pathogenicity or transmissibility, “but really all it takes is one change,” says Anthony Fehr, a biologist at the University of Kansas who studies the replication and pathogenesis of coronaviruses and was not involved in the work. Whether these nucleotide differences mean anything functionally for the viruses will be something look at in the future, he adds.
Jiang and colleagues noted differences in the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. For instance, one SARS-CoV accessory protein, known as 8a, is absent in the new virus. Other accessory proteins varied in length. In 2019-nCoV, 8b is 37 amino acids longer than in SARS-CoV while 3b is shorter by 132 amino acids.
“The structural proteins are very highly conserved between all coronaviruses, whereas accessory proteins are generally unique to each specific group of coronaviruses,” explains Fehr. The amino acid sequences show “the connection of this virus to the SARS-like coronaviruses and a little bit more distant relationship to SARS coronavirus.”
The researchers determined that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to bat SARS-like coronaviruses, from which SARS-CoV evolved, and more distantly related to MERS coronaviruses. Still, they did not find a single bat SARS-like coronavirus in which all the proteins were most similar to those of the new coronavirus. Instead, some 2019-nCoV proteins are more similar to those of bat SARS-like coronaviruses, while accessory proteins 3a and 8b are most similar to the SARS-CoVs.
Our “analysis of genome data of 2019-nCoV together with other coronaviruses clearly shows that, although this novel virus has high sequence similarity to SARS virus, they belong to distinct phylogenetic branches and were both derived from SARS-like virus isolated in bat,” writes Jiang in an email to The Scientist. 
In the paper, the authors acknowledge that, given the limited knowledge of 2019-nCoV, it is difficult to infer the functional significance of the 380 amino acid substitutions they found between 2019-nCoV and the SARS and SARS-like CoVs. According to Jiang, this question, as well as figuring out how the novel coronavirus has mutated and adapted over its short history in humans, will be the focus of future research.
“We’re all wondering where this virus came from, and we can see from the new sequence and the sequences that we’ve already had for coronaviruses that it’s likely to be a recombinant of a number of different coronaviruses that are known,” says Roper. She adds that this finding could help researchers understand how coronaviruses can jump into humans—2019-nCoV is the third to do so in the last 17 years. “This may continue, so the more we know about these the better.”
“The authors talk about it transmitting finally to humans, but we don’t know that this is its final jump. It could transmit to cats or dogs and then circulate back to humans,” says Roper. “We were able to control and stop SARS because it didn’t get into any other animals. . . . Hopefully it won’t happen, but we shouldn’t assume that it’s just going to stop with us.”

Outrage and Grief Follow Death of Coronavirus Whistleblower/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK, ROBERT WEI
L
i Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist who voiced an early warning about the coronavirus that has since infected more than 31,000 people, died today (February 7) after contracting the disease himself, according to People’s Daily. The New York Times reports that Li’s attempts to warn the Wuhan community about the virus early on were shut down by local police and medical officials. Li was 34 years old, married, and expecting his second child.
“A hero who released information about Wuhan’s epidemic in the early stage, Dr. Li Wenliang is immortal,” writes Zen Guang, chief scientist at the China Center for Disease Control, on the Sina Weibo microblog service, according to the Associated Press. 
“We will not forget the doctor who spoke up about an illness that was called rumor,” one person commented in reaction to an announcement of Li’s death on Weibo by Wuhan City Central Hospital, where Li had worked as an ophthalmologist and was being treated, according to the Times. “What else can we do? The only thing is not to forget.”
On December 30, Li had posted a warning to an online chat room about seven quarantined patients who exhibited symptoms resembling those of SARS, according to another article by the Times. A few days later, the police forced him to sign a statement declaring that his post about the virus was an illegal rumor that had “severely disturbed the social order,” reports the BBC. On January 10, he became infected after treating a glaucoma patient who had the virus. His diagnosis was confirmed on January 30.
Li later gave interviews from the hospital, telling the Times via text message, “If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.”
More than 600 people have now died from the coronavirus, almost all of them in mainland China. The Associated Press reports in another article that a baby born in China last Saturday (February 1) became the youngest known person to have contracted 2019-nCoV. In Hong Kong and Japan, nearly 8,000 people were quarantined on docked cruise ships after some passengers were confirmed to have the virus.
A rapidly constructed 1,000-bed hospital opened in Wuhan earlier this week, and a second new hospital with 1,500 beds was completed on Thursday (February 6), according to the AP, the same day when testing for a new antiviral drug made by Gilead Sciences was set to begin.

Indian Authorities Propose Use of Homeopathy to Prevent Coronavirus/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, VGAJIC
T
he Indian government’s Ministry of AYUSH, which promotes alternative medicine systems in the country, released a health advisory on January 29 that advocates the use of homeopathy and traditional remedies, such as Indian systems of medicine, to ward off infections of the newly circulating 2019-nCoV coronavirus. This includes the use of a homeopathic preparation called Arsenicum album 30C and two drops of sesame oil in each nostril each morning for prevention, and Unani medicines (treatments based on the teachings of Hippocrates and Galen) to mitigate symptoms of coronavirus infection. While AYUSH cites centuries of practitioners’ experiences with these products as evidence behind its advice, the media and the scientific community criticized the guidance as being counterproductive in dealing with a serious health emergency. 
“It is profoundly irresponsible of the Ministry of AYUSH to endorse homeopathy as this entirely undermines public understanding of science and medicine, and elevates pseudoscience with potentially dangerous consequences,” says David Robert Grimes, an Irish science writer who has published research showing homeopathy to be ineffective, in an email to The Scientist. Grimes has argued that the proposed mechanisms of homeopathy are implausible when analyzed from a physical and chemical perspective, and says that it is not surprising, therefore, that the biological effects of homeopathy cannot be measured in large-scale clinical trials. 
To date, more than 31,000 people in more than two dozen countries have been infected with 2019-nCoV, including three confirmed cases in India. According to the World Health Organization, there is no intervention yet identified that can treat the virus, although a number of studies are underway to find therapeutics and develop a vaccine. 
Using homeopathy as an alternative therapy risks forfeiting effective causative or symptomatic treatments or—if such treatments are not available—creating a false sense of security.
—Edzard Ernst, University of Exeter
Until then, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the only way to prevent infection is to avoid contact with the virus and people who are sick, to wash your hands, and not touch your face. But the Central Council for Research In Homeopathy (CCRH) of the Ministry of AYUSH claims that there are other preventive options. 
Anil Khurana, who heads the CCRH, tells The Scientist that Arsenicum album 30C, a homeopathic solution prepared by diluting aqueous arsenic trioxide until little or no arsenic remains that is used in respiratory disorders and has been in widespread use for more than 220 years with a good safety record, was found to be an effective prophylactic during the swine flu epidemic in India in 2009. A study conducted by Robert Mathie of the British Homeopathic Association and his group, in collaboration with the CCRH, reported in Homeopathy that of the various homeopathic medicines given to patients with swine flu symptoms, Arsenicum album was most successful in reducing fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, and headache. There was no control arm. In another, placebo-controlled trial conducted by the CCRH, homeopathic medicines were also found to reduce flu-like symptoms. 
These results led the CCRH to look to possible homeopathic interventions against the new coronavirus. Before any 2019-nCoV infections had turned up in India, scientists at CCRH collated the clinical features of a recent cluster of cases in China that was published in The Lancet on January 24, which they fed into a tool called the homeopathic repertory. The repertory is a database of historic texts on homeopathy, and when practitioners enter symptoms, the tool fetches the texts’ recommendations on which medicine needs to be given. “Every time we repertorize a patient, we are pretty much consulting all these generations of homeopaths that have contributed to this database,” says Bernado Merizalde, a homeopathy practitioner at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and the prime general secretary of Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis, a homeopathic doctors’ association. By matching the clinical features, the repertory found Arsenicum album 30C to be a suitable fit for the current outbreak. 
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
The basic premise of homeopathy is that a medicine that produces a set of symptoms when given to a healthy person under controlled settings can be prescribed in a highly diluted form to a diseased person with those same symptoms, explains Kushal Banerjee, a homeopathic physician based in New Delhi. This is what is known as Similia similibus curentur in homeopathic parlance, a Latin phrase that means “like cures like.” Kalyan Banerjee, Kushal’s father and a renowned homeopathic practitioner, says that by boosting the immune system of the body, Arsenicum album can potentially reduce the virulence of the coronavirus, thereby tempering disease intensity.
“We don’t claim 100 percent protection with Arsenicum album. Just taking the medicine will not work,” says Khurana. “All general measures for airborne infections have to be taken.” He further adds that if people get infected, they should promptly seek medical care.
Such caveats do not assuage the concerns of homeopathy’s detractors, who say there is no rigorous scientific evidence to indicate homeopathic remedies can prevent coronavirus infection or mitigate symptoms. “The claim of some homeopaths that homeopathic remedies are effective in treating or preventing coronavirus infections is not based on any evidence at all,” Edzard Ernst, an emeritus professor at the University of Exeter in the UK and a critic of homeopathy, tells The Scientist in an email. Ernst points to a study that found no difference between Arsenicum album and a placebo in preventing fever after vaccination. Other studies in which homeopathy was found to be ineffective include one on acute respiratory tract infections, another on middle ear infections, and yet another on influenza-like illness.
“Using homeopathy as an alternative therapy risks forfeiting effective causative or symptomatic treatments or—if such treatments are not available—creating a false sense of security,” says Ernst. “In any case, it would be a waste of resources.”
See “Scientists Scrutinize New Coronavirus Genome for Answers”
Even among proponents of homeopathy, there is disagreement about the best way to prevent the coronavirus. Mitchell Fleisher, the second vice president of the American Institute of Homeopathy, says that the Lancet article that scientists at CCRH used to come up with their advice does not provide enough information on symptoms to make an accurate homeopathic prescription.
He says that perhaps the best way to validate the therapeutic value of homeopathy would be to perform a comparative clinical outcome study of acute coronaviral infection by giving individualized homeopathic medicines to one experimental group and allopathic medicines to another, with a minimum of 250 patients in each group. “A careful and honest, statistical analysis of the study results will speak the scientific truth,” he says.
Countering Fleisher’s proposal, Grimes says that this is completely unethical. “Homeopathy has no plausible mechanism of action, and it is downright irresponsible to suggest it in a trial for a serious potential pandemic. Large scale studies of homeopathy have clearly shown over decades the same result—that it simply does not work,” he says.

Test for Novel Coronavirus Approved for Wide Deployment/-/ABOVE: CDC
U
ntil this week, healthcare providers in the US who suspected a patient might have the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV needed to send samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. But on Tuesday (February 4), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use declaration that allows the newly developed test to be distributed as a kit to any CDC-qualified laboratory.
“This continues to be an evolving situation and the ability to distribute this diagnostic test to qualified labs is a critical step forward in protecting the public health,” says FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in the agency’s announcement.
As of today, 2019-nCoV has killed 565 people and sickened more than 28,000. Since an epidemic of the virus began in Wuhan, China, in December, researchers in China and elsewhere have raced to sequence and analyze its genome, devise tests for it, and develop vaccines and treatments. 
Wired notes that the test for 2019-nCoV was approved for emergency use much more quickly than assays for other epidemic illnesses of the past decade, such as an Ebola test in 2014, which was rolled out about seven months after an outbreak in western Africa began. “Outbreaks have become the new norm,” Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the Geneva-based nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, tells the magazine. She adds that as a result, health organizations and governments have laid the groundwork for sharing viral samples early on in outbreaks: “There’s been a real cultural shift in how we deal with outbreaks toward more transparency and sharing.”
Meanwhile, despite the quick construction of new hospitals in Wuhan for people with the virus, the city still lacks the beds needed to care for all of those infected, Caixin reports. According to The New York Times, officials in the city have nevertheless been ordered to round up infected people and quarantine or hospitalize them.

Report of Asymptomatic Transmission of 2019-nCoV Inaccurate/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, RAWF8
A
s misinformation abounds regarding the novel coronavirus, scientists, health officials, and even Facebook are trying to combat the spread of fake news and questionable scientific findings. In the most recent takedown of inaccurate information, Science reports today (February 4) that a widely reported study describing the case of an asymptomatic woman who transmitted coronavirus to a colleague while visiting Germany from China was based on misleading accounts.
According to the news report, the authors who published their findings of asymptomatic transmission in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) last week gathered their evidence from interviews with other patients who had been in contact with her. But when government health officials in Germany spoke to the woman herself, she reported having felt sick at the time the transmission occurred.
“I feel bad about how this went, but I don’t think anybody is at fault here,” coauthor Christian Drosten, a virologist at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, tells Science. “Apparently the woman could not be reached at first and people felt this had to be communicated quickly.”
See “Scientists Zero in on the Novel Coronavirus’s Incubation Period”
Officials at the Robert Koch Institute, one of the government agencies that spoke to the patient, have written a letter to the journal and requested a correction.
The revelation doesn’t rule out the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the virus, which, according to CNN today, has infected more than 20,000 people and killed 426. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells Science that in a phone conversation with a colleague in China, “He said that he is convinced that there is asymptomatic infection and that some asymptomatic people are transmitting infection.”
The NEJM report is one of a number of scientific papers on the new virus that are taking heat for poor quality. For instance, a paper published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology concluded that snakes were a likely source of the coronavirus—but a number of experts who spoke to Nature dismissed the finding. “They have no evidence snakes can be infected by this new coronavirus and serve as a host for it,” Paulo Eduardo Brandão, a virologist at the University of São Paulo, told Nature.  
In another case, a preprint posted on bioRxiv last week that described “uncanny” similarities between HIV and 2019-nCoV has been “withdrawn,” although the PDF is still available. Researchers questioned the scientists’ techniques and conclusions, ultimately spurring the authors to retract their report.
“This is entirely bunk and bunk with bad citations and sourcing at that,” a commenter wrote on the preprint’s page.
Writing in STAT, Retraction Watch editors Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus note the rapidity of the reaction from the scientific community and subsequent response from authors as an upside to preprints. They say that detractors point out that peer review might have prevented such material from making it out in the public in the first place, but even peer-reviewed articles—the NEJM paper as a case in point—can be flawed. “Now we get to wait and see how long it takes NEJM to correct the record,” they write.

Flu and HIV Drugs Show Efficacy Against Coronavirus/-/ABOVE: WIKIMEDIA, MK2010
A
combination of flu and HIV medications may be able to treat severe cases of 2019-nCoV, the new coronavirus that has emerged in China, according to doctors in Thailand who have been caring for infected patients. The team’s approach, which used large doses of the flu drug oseltamivir combined with HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, improved the conditions of several patients at the Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok.
“This is not the cure, but the patient’s condition has vastly improved,” Rajavithi Hospital’s Kriangsak Atipornwanich says of one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, according to Reuters. “From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours.”
Thailand has so far recorded 19 cases of coronavirus, Reuters reports, making it the country with the greatest number of infections in Southeast Asia. Eight patients have recovered, while the rest are still undergoing treatment. Officials say that the country’s health ministry would meet today (February 3) to discuss the new treatment for severe cases. “We still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment,” Atipornwanich tells reporters.
Other countries have also showed interest in using HIV drugs against the new coronavirus. China’s National Health Commission recently began recommending lopinavir and ritonavir (sold together by Illinois-based pharma AbbVie as Kaletra), according to Fierce Pharma. AbbVie has pledged to donate about $1.5 million worth of Kaletra for the effort.
A randomized controlled clinical trial is now underway in China to test the anti-HIV drugs’ efficacy, according to a study published last week (January 24) in The Lancet. Scientists in Hong Kong will also likely test these drugs in patients alongside immune system–boosting medications, Hong Kong University microbiologist Yuen Kwok-Yung tells Science.
Other treatments being considered by national governments and pharma companies include Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir, a drug that was designed to treat Ebola but failed efficacy tests. “Gilead is working closely with global health authorities to respond to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak through the appropriate experimental use of our investigational compound remdesivir,” the company’s Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey says in a statement.
Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, meanwhile, is collaborating with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to develop an mRNA vaccine, Fierce Pharma reports.

Scientists Zero In on the Novel Coronavirus’s Incubation Period/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DR_MICROBE
Update (February 5): Health officials in Germany say the evidence reported in the New England Journal of Medicine around a case of asymptomatic transmission is inaccurate, and that the patient did indeed feel sick at the time she spread the virus.
L
ast weekend, Ma Xiaowei, director of China’s National Health Commission, announced that researchers believe the viral incubation period—the time it takes for an infected person to develop symptoms—could last up to 14 days for infections of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Xiaowei also said it appeared that at least some patients could transmit the virus during that time. Then yesterday (January 30), physicians described a case in The New England Journal of Medicine of a patient in Germany who apparently caught the virus from a business partner visiting from Shanghai while she was asymptomatic.
These revelations raise the possibility that people could spread the virus long before they know they have it. 
Understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to designing public health efforts.
Right now, scientists know very little for certain about what’s going on during 2019-nCoV’s incubation period, but there are some definitive characteristics they’re looking for, such as where the virus tends to enter the body, where it’s ultimately most likely to take hold, and how it affects the immune system. 
See “Scientists Scrutinize New Coronavirus Genome for Answers”
To cause an infection, a virus must invade cells and begin replicating. How quickly the virus spreads throughout the body depends on the virus’ lifecycle. “For SARS, that’s less than 24 hours: the virus particle could affect the cell and then emit thousands of progeny less than a day later,” says Tim Sheahan, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studied the SARS outbreak of 2003. “And that’s how the virus [is] capable of exponential growth.” Eventually, the virus rearranges the cell’s membrane and prompts several cells to fuse together. This causes enough damage to host tissues to tip off the immune system, triggering a response that causes symptoms as patients begin fighting off the infection. 
Coronaviruses such as those that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are particularly adept at evading immune detection and dampening immune responses. This partly explains why they tend to have longer incubation periods—two to seven days on average, but lasting up to two weeks—than infections such as influenza, which has an incubation period of just one to four days. It’s not yet clear exactly how the 2019-nCoV affects the immune system. 
Although scientists in the United States may soon have access to samples of 2019-nCoV to study in the lab, so far they’ve only been able to study the virus by analyzing the epidemiological and genetic data that researchers in China have published. Understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to designing public health efforts, helping researchers and physicians to determine when, and for how long, a patient should remain quarantined.
See “Australian Lab Cultures New Coronavirus as Infections Climb”
One recent preprint based on data from 34 patients outside of Wuhan estimated that the incubation period ranges from one to more than 11 days, averaging about six. But scientists have several questions that they’ll only be able to investigate once they’re able to study the actual virus.
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
One approach will be to use animal models to see how the virus travels through the respiratory tract. “Where you’re getting infected and where the virus really establishes” is key to both the severity of an infection and how contagious it is, says Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch who is following the 2019-nCoV data as they come out. A virus that replicates in the lower airway is generally more severe, but a virus that replicates in the upper airway may be easier to spread, he notes. 
Where the virus replicates also has implications for how patients are screened for the disease. “The major screening protocol all around the world is [looking for] high temperature and respiratory disease,” says Menachery. But it’s possible a patient could be infected and not display those traits. If 2019-nCoV replicates in the upper airway, nasal swabs could be used to screen patients who may be highly infectious, even if they don’t show symptoms.
I think we have to open the possibility that this one is more contagious [than] SARS.
—Michael Buchmeier, University of California, Irvine
It’s also possible that the virus can enter the body through multiple routes, says Buchmeier. “You might assume that it’s a respiratory-only disease,” he says, because the disease primarily causes respiratory symptoms. “But in fact, it can infect via any mucosal surface. And we don’t know what the difference is in the incubation based on an infection by different routes.”
Menachery says he also plans to study how the virus interacts with the immune system in human respiratory cell lines. He and his team hope to determine what tools the virus uses to evade the immune system, and how long it takes for the body to mount an immune response through conducting these in vitro experiments. They’ll use the answers to those questions to figure out if they can prime the immune system before exposure to the infection—the key to developing a vaccine.
One thing the scientists all note is that even without access to the virus, information about it has spread through the scientific community much more rapidly than in in previous outbreaks. “Six months from now, a lot of these things will become more clear,” Sheahan says.

Going Viral for the Wrong Reasons/-/ABOVE: ISTOCK, NAEBLYS
L
ast week, a story from The Scientist garnered a surprising degree of attention on social media platforms, causing a spike in traffic to that article on our website. Normally a welcome phenomenon, the increased traffic to this 2015 article about a lab-made coronavirus came with an asterisk. Readers weren’t simply perusing the story, enjoying it, and sharing it with friends. At least some people seemed to be using it to spread misinformation and ill-formed theories.
We at The Scientist have grown to expect a certain amount of misinterpretation, especially when we publish stories on emotionally charged topics: autism, cannabis, and genetically modified organisms, to name a few. We do our utmost to produce clear, accurate, and contextualized articles that communicate the science at the heart of even complex topics in a way that is accessible and rigorous. Still, once injected into the marketplace of ideas, we realize it is somewhat out of our hands as to how some readers might misrepresent or misinterpret our work—particularly when people perusing their social media feeds often look just at the headline and photo of a story before drawing a conclusion.
The 2015 story on coronaviruses was a news roundup about an international team of researchers that had engineered a coronavirus made of pieces of SARS and another coronavirus, giving it the ability to infect mice in the lab and cause an illness resembling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread to 17 countries and killed about 770 people more than 15 years ago. The publication of these findings reignited a debate about so-called gain-of-function studies, which the US government officially stopped funding as of 2013. (The SARS research in the story was started before the ban, and the National Institutes of Health allowed it to continue while it reviewed the research, eventually determining that the researchers could indeed publish the results.) In 2015, this was an important story for The Scientist to cover, and one that we hope contributed to the conversation about the relative benefits and dangers of such research.
In the past month, as a new coronavirus that emerged only late last year tears through the Chinese city of Wuhan and beyond, faithfully reporting the news and the science behind the story is crucial. Not only are readers interested in following the developing situation, but factual and appropriately contextualized information regarding the nascent outbreak may save lives. But it appears that some readers found the 2015 story and twisted its content to try to use it as support for a wholly unfounded hypothesis that the current outbreak originated with a lab-grown virus. For example, a now-removed Reddit post linked to the story and posited that “The rabbit hole is deeper than the Media are willing to report: ‘Lab-Made Coronavirus Triggers Debate.’” Similarly, Facebook user Tobi Ferguson posted a link to the story and wrote, in part, “There is ALWAYS so much MORE behind what the media shows you. This article is from 2015. Nothing new. Create the problem, sell the solution.”
Because the research surrounding the virus known as 2019-nCoV is so fluid, this kind of misinformation is particularly dangerous. Already, researchers are proposing ideas about how and where the virus originated. Some of these ideas are being rejected, and others are serving as leads to try and stem the spread. Stoking unwarranted fear and mistrust of scientists when thorough epidemiological research and willing participation from affected populations is needed is beyond irresponsible. The virus in that five-year-old story isn’t even the same strain as the one now circulating inside and outside of China.
While the 2015 story that we published in The Scientist in no way reports or even suggests that the lab-made coronavirus had exited the lab or was infecting human beings, are we as journalists responsible in some part for such misuse? Again, we understand that our work can be used in any number of ways to advance myriad arguments, whether they be reasonable or not. While people either not reading or intentionally ignoring something like the dateline of a story to create a false narrative into which their conspiratorial fantasy fits seems beyond our control, if some readers draw the erroneous connection between the 2015 work and the current outbreak because they don’t know that there are more than one type of coronaviruses, that may be an issue we can address. I look forward to continuing the conversation about the evolving responsibility of journalists in our modern era within and beyond the media community.
For now, we do feel responsible for the life of our stories after we put them out into the world. And we try hard to craft headlines and images that accurately portray the content of our articles. We are reminded that keeping an eye on these details becomes even more critical these days, when misinformation seems all too common. And when we are tasked with covering something as dynamic and important as the spread and study of the Wuhan virus, we pledge to be extra vigilant and, as ever, deliver information in a way that is unmistakably accurate and true.

Australian Lab Cultures New Coronavirus as Infections Climb/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, JARUN011
A
s of today (January 29), the World Health Organization had confirmed a total of 6,065 cases of the new coronavirus that started causing pneumonia-like symptoms in people in Wuhan, China, late last year. Sixty-eight of those confirmed cases come from 15 countries outside of China, raising concerns about the worldwide spread of the pathogen.
Researchers are studying the virus in hopes of aiding the effort to treat infections and minimize further transmission. Julian Druce, head of the Virus Identification Laboratory at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, and colleagues announced yesterday that they’d successful grown the virus in cell culture, after having isolated it from the first person in the country to be diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection.
The group, the first outside of China to successfully culture the virus, will share it with the WHO, which will distribute samples to research labs around the globe—something Chinese groups who claim to have grown the virus in the lab have not yet done. Working with the cultured virus may allow researchers to develop better treatments as well as diagnostics by detecting antibodies specific to 2019-nCoV, for example. “There are some things that are much easier to do when you have the virus,” Mike Catton, a deputy director of the Doherty Institute, tells Nature.
The news from Australia comes days after the WHO confirmed the first person-to-person spread of the virus outside of China: an individual in Vietnam who acquired the infection from a family member. Additionally, there have been media reports of a tour-bus driver in Japan who may have contracted the virus while transporting tourists from Wuhan, and a German man is thought to have been infected by a colleague who had recently visited Wuhan, China, according to Nature.
See “Scientists Scrutinize New Coronavirus Genome for Answers”
In a study published today in The Lancet, researchers in China analyzed the genomes of coronaviruses isolated from nine patients in Wuhan and found that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. The findings point to bats, which are sold at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, as a possible origin for the new outbreak. The Chinese team reports that eight patients had recently visited the market; the ninth patient had stayed in a nearby hotel.
“These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and 2019-nCoV in particular,” coauthor Guizhen Wu of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention says in a press release emailed to journalists. “However, despite the importance of bats, it seems likely that another animal host is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans.” The study also found evidence that the virus has only recently emerged in humans, with the genomes of the viruses isolated from the different patients differing by less than 0.1 percent.
See “Where Coronaviruses Come From”
The WHO is starting a global database to collect anonymized clinical data on infected individuals, and the agency will be hosting a meeting tomorrow to discuss whether the current outbreak should be considered a global health emergency.

A
n outbreak of a new virus known as 2019-nCoV, which began in Wuhan, China, in December, has now sickened more than 900 people and killed at least 26. Efforts to contain the outbreak have caused major disruption in China, particularly in Wuhan and nearby cities, where authorities have stopped most forms of transportation. While researchers quickly identified and sequenced 2019-nCoV, many questions remain about the novel coronavirus, including which species first passed it to humans.
See “Scientists Scrutinize New Coronavirus Genome for Answers”
The Scientist spoke with Peter Daszak, the president of the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance and an infectious disease researcher who’s done extensive research on emerging viruses in China and elsewhere. He talked with us about how 2019-nCoV fits in with other coronaviruses, including the virus that causes SARS, and how future events might be prevented.
Peter Daszak
© ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE
The Scientist: Can you give me an overview of what is known generally on the evolution of coronaviruses and how they manage to make the leap to a new species?
Peter Daszak: There’s a lot being done on how coronaviruses infect people from animals, because we’ve had a few events where they’ve jumped from animals into people, including from livestock. So for MERS, we know the real key is to know what the host cell receptor is—that’s the protein on the surface of cells that viruses bind to and invade. So if we share the same cell surface receptor that the virus uses in bats or in camels or in pigs, then there’s a risk of that virus invading us. 
For SARS coronavirus, the cell surface receptor is called ACE2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. We share that with bats, and [the virus] uses the same receptor [in bats and humans]. And . . . because this paper . . . just came out from the Wuhan [Institute of Virology] group, we now know that the new virus also uses that same surface receptor. [Editor’s note: Daszak regularly collaborates with two of the main authors of the paper but was not involved in that study.]
So . . . there’s a few clues as to why this virus jumped, but that’s the biochemical basis for its ability to get into people.
There is a very big diversity of these [corona]viruses in the wild. We’ve been looking at bats ever since the SARS outbreak because we’re the group that found bats are the real reservoir for SARS, not civets, that was originally thought. And what we found is there’s this big diversity: we’ve found over 50 SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. . . . 
See “Why Bats Make Such Good Viral Hosts”
The worrying thing is some of [the viruses] you can treat with vaccines and therapies that have been developed against SARS and it works, but [with] other viruses from bats, those therapeutics don’t work. So we’ve been saying for a while now that there are groups of viruses in bats that could be a risk, and in fact, one of them, we developed an antibody test and we went to communities in Yunnan Province [in] rural southwest China, and [tested] people who live near bat colonies where we’d found these viruses. . . . We found a 3 percent prevalence of exposure to bat viruses. . . . Suggesting that all the time across the region, bat viruses are getting into people and either infecting them with a mild infection [with] no clinical signs, or causing respiratory illness that never gets diagnosed properly. So this outbreak is probably just one of a number of spillover events that have happened in south China.
TS: Is it known what factors determine whether a spillover event will become much bigger, like what’s happened in Wuhan?
PD: There’s a virological side to it, and then there’s a human dimension to it as well—a population-level dimension. [On] the virology side, it’s pretty clear that some of these viruses don’t bind very well and have trouble developing a raging infection. And some of them do and it’s difficult to predict that. 
This outbreak is probably just one of a number of spillover events that have happened in south China.
—Peter Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance
From a human population side, I think the real issue is if one of these viruses gets into a wildlife market where the chance of one animal infecting multiple people is much higher, that’s where the risk is highest. If you think about a bat cave in Yunnan . . . people don’t go into the cave much. . . . The bats fly out of the cave and and eat food, they eat insects in the surrounding villages. So the interface expands to a few thousand people. But still, it’s a low probability of the virus getting in, because it [requires] exposure to feces—in bats, these viruses are within the intestine. But if you start hunting bats in the cave, and then you bring them into a market live, then the bats are shedding feces in the market. And then you can infect things like civets and pigs and people. . . . Or if a bat . . . starts foraging for insects around a farm like a pig farm, and pigs get infected, or some of the other animals in the farm, [like] civets and bamboo rats, then suddenly you’ve got 100 animals infected, [and] you can infect a lot more people. I wouldn't be surprised if we find out somewhere in the next few weeks that actually the initial exposure was from another animal—it’s bats, then to another animal, then to people. 
TS: How does the finding that this new virus is related to SARS figure into efforts to contain it?
PD: To my mind, what this work [the phylogeny of 2019-nCoV] shows is that the new virus is not as dramatically different as we thought it might be. It’s part of a cluster of viruses from bats. Within that cluster, we had a previous pandemic strain, which is SARS, and we’ve now got a new pandemic strain, which is Wuhan novel coronavirus. I expect within that cluster there are other viruses that can cause pandemics, and that's the big lesson: We’ve got clear and present danger. We’ve known about it for 15 years. We should be focused on this group like a laser, looking at every possible way these viruses can get into people and trying to do work to prevent that spillover. Because the big threat here is that we don’t yet have good vaccines or good drugs that will beat SARS, let alone a relative of SARS that is slightly different.
The other big lesson is that there are simple ways we can reduce risk, and you don’t have to close the markets. What you’ve got to do is do better surveillance within the markets. We’ve got to find all these viruses in bats, get the sequences in the labs, get the viruses in the lab, and start working on new drugs—and deal with sanitation conditions. Wearing of gloves, washing of hands for people who work in markets and handle these animals, and people who live near bat colonies.
TS: You’re suggesting that we should be working on developing drugs for things that haven’t infected people yet but that we think have the potential to?
PD: Absolutely. We’ve been saying that for a few years now. . . . If we really believe that pandemics are going to emerge again, and we’ve got good evidence for that, we’re not saying spend billions of dollars creating a new drug for [a specific] virus; what we’re saying is, look at the drugs we’re developing against SARS. And instead of just focusing on that one virus, let’s treat this whole clade as a threat, and let’s make sure those drugs work against this whole clade. And that might mean tweaking some of those monoclonal antibody therapies or tweaking those vaccines a little bit to make them broader. It doesn’t mean completely changing track. I just think that if we spend a few hundred million dollars creating a SARS vaccine and find it doesn’t work on the next virus to emerge, we’ve just wasted a few hundred million dollars and we will lose lives because of that. So to me, that’s just common sense and a no brainer.
TS: Is there anything you’d like to add?
PD: The big picture to us is, we should treat these pandemics as a public health problem. . . . When we think about heart disease, we know the cause of heart disease. And the answer to heart disease is not to wait until you get it and then treat it. The answer is to change your habits before [you] get it. And I think we need to treat pandemics the same way on a global scale. We need to think about the underlying drivers, whether that’s wildlife for food or deforestation or road building into the tropics, mines in the middle of the forest. These are the things that lead to new outbreaks. And they’re the things we need to focus intently on and say, let’s change our behavior around them. We don’t need to stop doing them. We need to do them in a safer, smarter way.

s of today (January 23), 18 people have died from a newly identified coronavirus, and more than 630 have been infected. Airports are screening passengers coming from at-risk regions. Public celebrations of the Lunar New Year have been cancelled in several Chinese cities. China has stopped trains and other transportation leaving Wuhan, where the infections originated, and restricted travel within the city and neighboring areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) held a conference today to discuss the travel bans and other precautions related to the new disease, currently being called 2019-nCoV, a respiratory virus with characteristics similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2003.
As public health officials respond in real-time to the unfolding of the outbreak, so too are scientists. Just one month after the first case of the pneumonia-causing virus was reported on December 8, Chinese scientists sequenced the viral genome and made it public. Now, researchers around the globe are scrutinizing the sequence for insight into this mystery disease.
“It really is an amazing feat that they got these sequences out as quickly as they did,” says Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch who has studied the new genome. That speed, he notes, stands in contrast with the SARS outbreak, in which “for many months, it was not known that there was an outbreak.”

While there are still concerns that China has silenced critics and downplayed the seriousness of the disease, the genome’s availability is already helping doctors properly diagnose the infection. It causes flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever that make it difficult to distinguish from other, more common illnesses.
“It seems like it might be a little less clinically severe than SARS, though it’s still very early,” says Alex Greninger, a virologist at the University of Washington. “This virus has escalated quite quickly. And when you’re at this point in the epidemic curve, it’s very hard to know which way things are going.”
When a man in Washington state developed mild symptoms two days after returning from Wuhan on January 15, his doctors shipped his sample overnight to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to confirm that the sample matched the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV. The strategy can also be used to determine the presence of the virus in individuals who don’t show symptoms but may still be able to spread it to others. Without the genome, officials would not have been able to definitively diagnose the disease.
The virus is somewhat similar to the SARS virus, says Menachery. He points out that almost all of 2019-nCoV’s proteins are the same as SARS’s, but “it does have differences in the key areas that you would expect will influence its ability to infect humans.”
Coronaviruses are so named because they have surface proteins that stick out like tips on a crown. These spikes help them invade cells. The S1 region of the protein first binds to a receptor on a human (or animal) cell, and the S2 region then fuses and allows the virus to enter that cell. Menachery says the S2 portion of the spike protein on the coronavirus matches that of the SARS virus, but the S1 region is somewhat different, meaning 2019-nCoV could use a different cell receptor for entry than the SARS virus does. However, a preprint that came out today from Wuhan-based scientists suggests that the two viruses do, in fact, utilize the same cell entry receptor, ACE2.
It’s possible that antiviral treatments currently in development to treat other viruses may be able to treat this new virus. The genomic analysis has suggested that the virus’ RNA polymerase—the target of one such drug called remdesivir—is conserved in 2019-nCoV. “We’d expect that they would work. But again, you don’t know that they’ll work until you actually test them. Nature has a way of getting around things,” says Menachery. Plus, the treatments haven’t been approved for any indications yet. There is a clinical trial recruiting patients to test the drug’s ability to treat Ebola, but other work is still preclinical.
Some of the most important characteristics of the disease can’t be understood from the virus’ genome alone. It was only earlier this week that researchers determined the virus could spread between humans and did not require direct contact with an infected animal. Researchers still aren’t sure how it is transmitted between people. “Is it shed only in respiratory secretions? Is it found in the urine? Is it found in the blood? Is it found in stool? What’s infectious? How long’s it infectious? How high the viral load can get,” says Greninger, “all those things are enabled by the genome, certainly. But you can’t deduce it from the genome.”
Additionally, while scientists know the virus emerged in Wuhan, China, at a market known for selling all sorts of live animals from both land and ocean, it’s unclear what species the virus came from, and that can’t be determined from the genome alone. “Knowing the source of the SARS epidemic really helped stamp out the problem,” says Anthony Fehr, who studies coronaviruses at the University of Kansas. “We can’t figure out the source just knowing the [genetic] sequence.”
The genome does give scientists some insight, though. For example, there was very little genetic variation between the first 10 patient samples sequenced by various teams across the world. Menachery says that’s a sign the virus recently jumped from animals to humans. “It doesn’t appear that these viruses have been in human populations for a long time and just not recognized,” he says. “It appears that they potentially recently emerged from either an animal host or some other location.”
Scientists will need to keep comparing new samples to determine how the virus adapts as it infects more people. “The other thing the sequence allows us to do,” says Fehr, “is see if the virus is evolving in real time. Are there mutations in the virus adapting to the human population; is it becoming more easily transmitted between humans because of certain mutations?”
On January 22, a team of China-based scientists published an article based on the virus’ genome that suggested it’s possible the coronavirus emerged from snakes. But, “the paper does not provide direct evidence that this virus was transmitted to humans from snakes and the indirect evidence is tenuous at best,” says Mark Stenglein, a virologist at the University of Colorado, in an email to The Scientist. “Scientists should disseminate only well supported information, especially in the context of a possible public health emergency.”
Only about 2 percent of those infected with the new coronavirus have died. So far, those deaths have primarily been older men with preexisting conditions, but many more have ended up seriously ill and are still in the hospital, according to officials at the WHO conference today. “In the next couple of weeks or so, we're going to see more and more cases. We’re going to start to see how serious it really is,” says Peter Gulick, an infectious disease specialist at Michigan State University. “Right now, we’re just hearing numbers here, numbers there . . . numbers that may not have substance, but just may make you worry.”

hina’s National Health Commission said today (January 21) that the number of confirmed infections of a newly identified coronavirus has risen to 291 in the country, the Associated Press reports, and six people have died from the pneumonia-like illness it causes. Chinese officials now say that confirmed cases of person-to-person transmission of the virus have taken place. 
Meanwhile, cases of infection with the virus, known as 2019-nCoV, have also been reported in travelers from China to other countries, including Japan and Thailand, and the US Centers for Disease Control announced a case in Washington state. The flurry of news comes at the start of the world’s largest human migration, in which millions of people travel across China to spend Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Chinese New Year, with their families.
“The outbreak is at a critical stage, and we estimate an increasing number of infections during the 40 days of Spring Festival travel rush,” respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan tells The Washington Post. Zhong, who is known for discovering the SARS virus that originated in southern China in the early 2000s, leads an expert group at China’s National Health Commission. 
The first instances of the viral infection had been linked to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan that is now closed. Chinese officials had previously said that the virus did not appear to spread person-to-person but Zhong said late Monday on Chinese state television that two people in Guangdong Province, China, who had not visited Wuhan had contracted the virus through contact with another person, the AP reports.

“The sudden spike in cases is disconcerting, but not entirely unexpected,” infectious disease researcher Adam Kamradt-Scott of the University of Sydney tells Science. The publicity given to the outbreak encourages both patients and doctors to be on the lookout for the disease, driving the number of diagnoses up, he explains. “If we continue to see this trend continue over the next week where there are 50 to 100 new cases every day, then that would be cause for further concern.”
An estimate released last week by infectious disease researchers at Imperial College London suggests that the true number of cases could be much higher than that released by the National Health Commission. Based on the number of diagnoses in East Asian countries and other information, the group calculated that between 427 and 4,471 people in Wuhan would have experienced symptoms of the illness as of January 12.
The World Health Organization will convene an expert panel tomorrow to discuss whether to declare 2019-nCoV a global health emergency, STAT reports.
Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said in a news briefing that Chinese authorities’ response to the outbreak has been much quicker than it was to SARS, which ultimately killed more than 700 people. “Our underlying assumptions are the force of infection is very different now . . . because so many public health measures have been undertaken and so many interventions have been executed,” Leung said in comments reported by the AP. He added that modeling shows the number of new cases will continue to multiply over the coming weeks but that the outbreak will gradually fade as containment measures take effect.
One Wuhan resident tells the wire service that despite the news, disruption to daily life in the city has been minimal. “Maybe people from other places are more concerned about our health, but (Wuhan) locals actually are continuing to eat, go out and take strolls, go clubbing at night,” Helen Cao says. “Everything’s very normal, everyone’s just wearing masks, nothing more.”

ealth authorities in Wuhan, China, reported on Saturday the death of a 61-year-old man in a mysterious pneumonia outbreak linked to a seafood market, according to Reuters. The patient was one of 41 confirmed cases, seven of whom are severely ill, the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in a statement published yesterday (January 12). The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee confirmed that the man who died had underlying health issues, including abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease, reports STAT. 
Last week, the Chinese state media reported that the pneumonia outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus. Other types of coronavirus can cause a cold and more serious infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
On Saturday, Chinese researchers published a draft genome of the coronavirus. According to their report, the virus “is similar to some of the betacoronaviruses detected in bats, but is distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.” STAT reports that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, suggesting that all infections have occurred from exposure to an infected animal.
Global health experts are praising the decision to release the genome. “As a result of Wuhan, China & beyond sharing the sequence data, the advice China CDC & WHO can offer is hugely enhanced, diagnostic tests can be improved, serological assays developed & the data used to support evidenced based policy-a great day for global public health,” writes Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, in a tweet.
Virus researcher Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina set out to reverse engineer a live virus from the sequence in his lab as soon as the draft genome was published, according to Science. “One of the things that’s sad is that the public doesn’t realize how incredibly competent the public health and the basic science community are at going from a newly discovered virus to a tremendous amount of capacity to trace and try to control its spread,” Baric tells Science.
Previous news reports had cited 59 instances of the illness. According to the WHO’s statement, there have been no additional pneumonia cases reported since January 3, and “investigations are still underway to determine the full extent of the outbreak.”

New Coronavirus Identified in Central China Pneumonia Outbreak/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, XRENDER
A
mysterious new type of pneumonia linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, is caused by a novel coronavirus, Chinese state media reported today (January 9). The reports come a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that multiple known viruses had been ruled out as a cause of the outbreak, and that a coronavirus was the likely cause. The virus had sickened at least 59 people in China as of Sunday, and according to the Associated Press, one suspected case—a woman who fell ill after returning from China—has been identified in South Korea. 
Xinhua reports that the virus was identified by the Chinese Academy of Engineering’s Xu Jianguo based on tests of samples from 15 patients with the illness. Known coronaviruses include some that cause a cold, as well as the pathogens behind severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,” the WHO’s Gauden Galea says in a statement quoted by multiple news outlets.
See “Cause of Viral Pneumonia Outbreak in China Unknown”
“If the Chinese truly have sequenced the virus and they’ve demonstrated that it’s present in other patients, [that] means there’s a PCR diagnostic test available. And the Chinese need to make that available to the rest of the world immediately,” Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, tells STAT. He explains that coronaviruses could be transmitted to people from bats, or through a different animal species that had been infected by a bat.
“I am stunned by the timeline and speed of this isolation and characterization, if it’s all true,” says Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in remarks to STAT. He expressed skepticism about Chinese authorities’ claim that the virus can’t be transmitted between humans, saying, “I don’t know how you know that at all.” Given the number of reported cases, he says, it’s not likely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way the virus can spread.
David Hui, an emerging infections expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, shares a similar take with The New York Times. “So, there are still a lot of question marks,” he says. “It’s premature to say that there’s no human-to-human transmission.”

Cause of Viral Pneumonia Outbreak in China Unknown/-/ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, WANHAO CAI

hinese health authorities are searching for the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Hubei province that began last month, Reuters reported yesterday (January 5). The respiratory illness, of which there are now 59 documented cases, doesn’t seem to be caused by known pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, or avian influenza viruses, health authorities said in a statement yesterday, leading to fears that a novel virus is infecting people in the area.
“It sounds to me like it’s something that’s jumped from animals to humans, and it’s in early stages,” virus researcher Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina tells STAT. “And right now it’s virus evolution versus public health control measures to try to prevent spread.”
The first cases of the mysterious illness, which comes with a fever and in some instances shortness of breath and lung infections, were reported in mid-December in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan. The origin of the outbreak was soon traced to the city’s wholesale Huanan Seafood Market—an early clue that the virus may have zoonotic origins, Guan Yi of the University of Hong Kong tells Science. The market has now been closed.
Of the cases reported so far (several of which are in people who had traveled from Wuhan to Hong Kong), none show clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. More than 160 people who have had contact with the patients are also under medical observation in China, while Hong Kong has stepped up its health monitoring of travelers arriving by air or rail.
The most recently reported case was a person who fell sick on December 29, according to the Chinese health authorities’ statement on Sunday. A World Health Organization (WHO) statement published yesterday notes that “WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China.”

Babraham Appoints Wakelam/-/T
he UK’s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) announced a couple of days ago that it had appointed Michael Wakelam, currently of the University of Birmingham, to be its director as of January 1 next year. Wakelam looks to be a good match for the institute, which conducts research and training in the mechanisms of cell communication and gene regulation. His own area of expertise is cell signaling, with a focus on the regulation of signalling pathways in normal and cancer cells and in inflammatory responses. 
“I look forward to the stimulation of leading such a successful and focused centre, both in terms of the science and the increasingly successful interactions with biotech businesses at the Babraham campus,” he said. 
Unsurprisingly, the BBSRC’s notice made no mention of the racial discrimination case that been brought against the BBSRC last year over the selection process for the director’s job....
